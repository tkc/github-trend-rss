## Why does it exist? 🔓

Calibre, while a fantastic tool for its age, has several problems when containerised, including its reliance on a KasmVNC server instance for the UI, which is near impossible to use on mobile and is relatively resource-heavy if you&#039;re running a small, lower power server like I am.

For many, Calibre-Web has really swooped in to save the day, offering an alternative to a containerised Calibre instance that&#039;s resource-light and with a much more modern UI to boot.

However, when compared to full-fat Calibre, it unfortunately lacks a few core features leading many to run both services in parallel, each serving to fill in where the other lacks, resulting in an often clunky, imperfect solution.

## Goal of the Project 🎯

Calibre-Web Automated aims to be an all-in-one solution, combining the modern lightweight web UI from Calibre-Web with the robust, versatile feature set of Calibre, with a slew of extra features and automations thrown in on top.

![Calibre-Web Automated Example Homepage](README_images/CWA-Homepage.png)
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CWA allows you to keep your ebook library accessible &amp; organised and looks good while doing it&lt;/i&gt; 😎🦚&lt;/p&gt;

## 🚨 To users planning to deploy via Network Shares (particularly NFS) 🚨

- Calibre, Calibre-Web and CWA are all SQLite3 based applications and as a result **don&#039;t like being run over network shares (especially NFS)**
    - SQLite is designed as a lightweight, file-based database system, and it assumes the underlying file system supports certain guarantees about **file locking, atomic writes, and consistency**
    - **Network file systems (e.g., NFS, SMB/CIFS, etc.) often do not meet these assumptions, which can lead to issues.**
  - Some users are successful in deploying CWA across NFS shares however doing so **can produce a lot of hard to diagnose issues** that take time away from users with actual issues
  - **Therefore as of V3.0.0, deployments over NFS shares are &quot;unsupported&quot;**, meaning **you are free to do so**, but **support will not be provided for users facing issues**

### Network shares and SQLite WAL mode

- CWA optimizes SQLite concurrency by enabling Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) on local disks.
- Some network filesystems (NFS/SMB) do not fully support WAL or reliable file locking, which can cause intermittent &quot;database is locked&quot; errors or corruption risks.
- If you are deploying on a network share, set the following environment variable to disable WAL:

  - `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true`

This tells CWA to avoid enabling WAL on the Calibre `metadata.db` and the `app.db` settings database. It also disables recursive ownership changes (`chown`) performed by init/maintenance scripts to avoid permission issues on network filesystems. Default is `false` (WAL enabled) for better performance on local disks.

#### File watching on network shares

- By default, CWA uses Linux `inotify` (via `inotifywait`) to detect new files in the ingest folder with minimal latency and overhead.
- On network shares (NFS/SMB), filesystem events can be unreliable or unavailable. When `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true` is set, CWA switches the ingest and metadata watcher services to a polling-based watcher that periodically scans for changes. This improves reliability on NAS/network mounts at the cost of slightly higher I/O and up to a few seconds of latency.
- On Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS), the container runs on a LinuxKit/WSL2 VM and host-mounted paths may not propagate `inotify` events reliably. CWA auto-detects Docker Desktop at startup and prefers the same polling watcher for reliability.
- Advanced: You can also force polling regardless of share mode by setting `CWA_WATCH_MODE=poll`.

### Running behind multiple proxies (Cloudflare Tunnel, reverse proxy)

- CWA uses Werkzeug&#039;s ProxyFix middleware to properly handle `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and other proxy headers.
- By default, it trusts **1 proxy** in the chain. If you have multiple proxies (e.g., Cloudflare Tunnel → nginx → CWA), set:

  - `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=2` (or the total number of proxies in your chain)

- **Why this matters**: Session protection validates requests based on the client&#039;s IP address. If ProxyFix doesn&#039;t trust enough proxies, it may see different IPs between requests, causing &quot;Session protection triggered&quot; warnings and forcing re-login.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you see frequent session protection warnings in logs, check your proxy chain depth and adjust this variable accordingly.

#### **Automatic Ingest Service** ✨
- CWA currently supports automatic ingest of 27 different popular ebook formats
- Users can configure the services behavior to ignore and/or have certain formats automatically converted to other formats in the Admin Panel

&lt;!-- - A **Weighted Conversion Algorithm:** ⚖️
  - Using the information provided in the Calibre eBook-converter documentation on which formats convert best into epubs, CWA is able to determine from downloads containing multiple eBook formats, which format will convert most optimally, ignoring the other formats to ensure the **best possible quality** and no **duplicate imports** --&gt;

#### **Automatic Conversion Service** 🔃
- On by default though can be toggled of in the CWA Settings page, with EPUB as the default target format
  - _Available target formats include:_ **EPUB**, **MOBI**, **AZW3**, **KEPUB** &amp; **PDF**
- Upon detecting new files in the Ingest Directory, if any of the files are in formats the user has configured CWA to auto-convert to the current target format,
- The following **28 file types are currently supported:**
  - _.acsm, .azw, .azw3, .azw4, .mobi, .cbz, .cbr, .cb7, .cbc, .chm, .djvu, .docx, .epub, .fb2, .fbz, .html, .htmlz, .lit, .lrf, .odt, .pdf, .prc, .pdb, .pml, .rb, .rtf, .snb, .tcr, .txtz_
  - _Note: .acsm requires an additional Calibre plugin_

#### **Automatic Enforcement of Changes made to Covers &amp; Metadata through the Calibre-Web UI!** 👀📔
- In stock Calibre-Web, any changes made to a book&#039;s **Cover and/or Metadata** are only applied to how the book appears in the Calibre-Web UI, changing nothing in the ebook&#039;s files like you would expect
- This results in a frustrating situation for many CW users who utilise CW&#039;s Send-To-Kindle function, and are disappointed to find that the High-Quality Covers they picked out and carefully chosen Metadata they sourced are completely absent on all their other devices! UGH!
- CWA&#039;s **Automatic Cover &amp; Metadata Enforcement Feature** makes it so that **WHATEVER** you changes you make to **YOUR** books, **_are made to the books themselves_**, as well as in the Web UI, **making what you see, what you get.**

![Cover Enforcement CWA](README_images/cwa-enforcer-diagram.png &quot;CWA 1.2.0 Cover Enforcement Diagram&quot;)

#### **Batch Editing &amp; Deletion!** 🗂️🗄️
- Say goodbye to clicking that edit button again, and again, and again just to remove or edit a single series!
- To use, simply navigate to the `Books List`page on the left hand side of the Web UI, select the books you wish to edit/ delete and use the buttons either above the table or within the headers to do whatever you need!
- _Courtesy of [@jmarmstrong1207](https://github.com/jmarmstrong1207)_

![](/README_images/cwa-bulk-editting-diagram.png)

#### **Automated Back Up Service** 🔒
- Worried what will happen if something goes wrong during one of CWA&#039;s automated functions? Don&#039;t be!
- By default, the originals all files processed by CWA are stored in `/config/processed_books` though this can be toggled in the CWA Settings panel

#### **Automatic EPUB Fixer Service** 🔨
- Ever had it where you&#039;re super excited to start reading your next book but for some reason, Amazon&#039;s Send-to-Kindle service just keeps rejecting it? Well no more!

- Originally developed by [innocenat](https://github.com/innocenat/kindle-epub-fix), this tool corrects the following potential issues for every EPUB processed by CWA:
  - Fixes UTF-8 encoding problem by adding UTF-8 declaration if no encoding is specified
  - Fixes hyperlink problem (result in Amazon rejecting the EPUB) when NCX table of content link to `&lt;body&gt;` with ID hash.
  - Detect invalid and/or missing language tag in metadata, and prompt user to select new language.
  - Remove stray `&lt;img&gt;` tags with no source field.
  - Resolves several EPUB compatibility issues, such as UTF-8 encoding, hyperlink problems, invalid/missing language tags, and stray image tags.
- This **ensures maximum comparability** for each EPUB file with the Amazon **Send-to-Kindle** service and for those who don&#039;t use Amazon devices, has the side benefit of cleaning up your lower quality files!
- Enabled by default but can be toggled in settings.
- Files processed by the EPUB-Fixer service are by default automatically backed up to `/config/processed_books` however this can also be toggled in the settings.
- Bulk processing of whole library with progress tracking available in the Admin Panel
- Available via both the Web UI and CLI

#### **Simple to use Multi-Format Conversion Service** 🌌
- This utility gives the user the option to either keep a copy of the original of all converted files in `/config/processed_books` or to trust the process and have CWA simply convert and replace those files (not recommended)
- Full usage details can be found [here](#the-convert-library-tool)

![CWA Convert Library Web UI](/README_images/CWA-new-process-ui.gif)

#### **Additional Metadata Providers** 🗃️
- Users can now make use of [isbndb.com](https://isbndb.com/)&#039;s huge database when fetching metadata for the books in their library!
- Access is being provided via [ibdb.dev](https://ibdb.dev/) thanks to a generous donation to the community by [@chad3814](https://www.github.com/chad3814)
- [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) is also currently in the process of being added to CWA as a Metadata Provider

#### **KOReader Syncing (KOSync)** 📖⚡
Built-in KOReader progress sync with automatic book identification:
- **Book Identification:** Auto-generates KOReader-compatible partial MD5 checksums for all books
- **Unified Progress:** Syncs KOReader → CWA reading status → Kobo devices
- **Zero Config:** Checksums generated on startup and import, no manual setup
- **Modern Auth:** RFC 7617 HTTP Basic Auth with existing CWA accounts
- **Plugin Available:** Download from `/kosync` endpoint on your CWA instance

#### **Enhanced OAuth 2.0/OIDC Authentication** 🔐
- **Auto-Discovery:** Automatic endpoint configuration via OIDC metadata URLs for seamless setup with providers like Keycloak, Authentik, Google, and Azure AD
- **Manual Override:** Full manual control over OAuth endpoints when auto-discovery isn&#039;t available
- **Field Mapping:** Configurable JWT field extraction for usernames and emails to work with any provider&#039;s token structure
- **Group-Based Roles:** Automatic admin role assignment based on OAuth provider groups
- **Testing Tools:** Built-in connection testing and validation to ensure your configuration works before going live
- **Enterprise Ready:** Support for custom scopes, multiple authentication methods, and comprehensive troubleshooting
- **📖 [Full OAuth Configuration Guide](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/wiki/OAuth-Configuration)** for detailed setup instructions

#### **Server Stats Tracking Page** 📍📊
  - Ever wondered how many times CWA has been there for you in the background? Check out the CWA Stats page to see a fun list of statistics showing how many times CWA has been there to make your life just that little bit easier
- A database also exists to keep track of any and all enforcements, imports, conversions &amp; fixes both for peace of mind and to make the checking of any bugs or weird behaviour easier
  &lt;!-- - Full documentation can be found below [here](#checking-the-cover-enforcement-logs) --&gt;

![CWA Server Stats Page](/README_images/cwa-server-stats-page.png)

#### **Library Auto-Detect** 📚🕵️
  - Made to **MASSIVELY** simplify the setup process for both **new and existing users** alike
  - **New Users without existing Libraries:** 🆕
    - **No library? No problem!**
    - New users without existing Calibre Libraries no longer need to copy and paste `metadata.db` files and point to their location in the Web UI, CWA will now automatically detect the lack of Library in your given bind and automatically create a new one for you! It will even automatically register it with the Web UI so you can really hit the ground running
  - **New or Existing Users with Existing Libraries:**
    - Simply bind a directory containing your Calibre Library (search is done recursively so it doesn&#039;t matter how deep in the directory it is) and CWA will now automatically find it and mount it to the Web UI
    - Should you bind a directory with more than 1 Calibre Library in it, CWA will intelligently compare the disk sizes of all discovered libraries and mount the largest one
      - _CWA supports only one library per instance though support for multiple libraries is being investigated for future releases_
      - _In the meantime, users with multiple libraries who don&#039;t want to consolidate them are advised to run multiple, parallel instances_

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Вещи, которые вам нужно знать перед установкой

- Это бета-версия, которая находится в активной разработке. Из версии в версию что-то может меняться.
- При возникновении проблем, нужен технически грамотный фидбэк в чат. Ознакомьтесь с закрепом в топике.
- При обновлении **обязательно** [сбрасывайте кэш LuCI](https://podkop.net/docs/clear-browser-cache/).
- Также при обновлении всегда заходите в конфигурацию и проверяйте свои настройки. Конфигурация может измениться.
- Необходимо минимум 25МБ свободного места на роутере. Роутеры с флешками на 16МБ сразу мимо.
- При старте программы редактируется конфиг Dnsmasq.
- Podkop редактирует конфиг sing-box. Обязательно сохраните ваш конфиг sing-box перед установкой, если он вам нужен.
- Информация здесь может быть устаревшей. Все изменения фиксируются в [телеграм-чате](https://t.me/itdogchat/81758/420321).
- [Если у вас что-то не работает.](https://podkop.net/docs/diagnostics/)
- Если у вас установлен Getdomains, [его следует удалить](https://github.com/itdoginfo/domain-routing-openwrt?tab=readme-ov-file#%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F).
- Требуется версия OpenWrt 24.10.
- Dashboard доступен, если вы заходите по http (из-за особенностей clash api). И не будет работать, если вы заходите по https и/или домену.

# Документация

# Установка Podkop
Полная информация в [документации](https://podkop.net/docs/install/)

Вкратце, достаточно одного скрипта для установки и обновления:
```
sh &lt;(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itdoginfo/podkop/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```

## Изменения 0.7.0
Начиная с версии 0.7.0 изменена структура конфига `/etc/config/podkop`. Старые значения несовместимы с новыми. Нужно заново настроить Podkop.

Скрипт установки обнаружит старую версию и предупредит вас об этом. Если вы согласитесь, то он сделает автоматически написанное ниже.

При обновлении вручную нужно:

0. Не ныть в issue и чатик.
1. Забэкапить старый конфиг:
```
mv /etc/config/podkop /etc/config/podkop-070
```
2. Стянуть новый дефолтный конфиг:
```
wget -O /etc/config/podkop https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itdoginfo/podkop/refs/heads/main/podkop/files/etc/config/podkop
```
3. Настроить заново ваш Podkop через Luci или UCI.

# ToDo

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]  
&gt; PR принимаются только по issues, у которых стоит label &quot;enhancement&quot;. Либо по согласованию с авторами в ТГ-чате. Остальные PR на данный момент не рассматриваются.

## Будущее
- [ ] [Подписка](https://github.com/itdoginfo/podkop/issues/118). Здесь нужна реализация, чтоб для каждой секции помимо ручного выбора, был выбор фильтрации по тегу. Например, для main выбираем ключевые слова NL, DE, FI. А для extra секции фильтруем по RU. И создаётся outbound c urltest в которых перечислены outbound из фильтров.
- [ ] Весь трафик в sing-box и маршрутизация полностью на его уровне.
- [ ] При успешном запуске переходит в фоновый режим и следит за состоянием sing-box. Если вдруг идёт exit 1, выполняется dnsmasq restore и снова следит за состоянием. Вопрос в том, как это искусственно провернуть. Попробовать положить прокси и посмотреть, останется ли работать DNS в этом случае. И здесь, вероятно, можно обойтись триггером в init.d. [Issue](https://github.com/itdoginfo/podkop/issues/111)
- [ ] Галочка, которая режет доступ к doh серверам.
- [ ] IPv6. Только после наполнения Wiki.

## Тесты
- [ ] Unit тесты (BATS)
- [ ] Интеграционные тесты бекенда (OpenWrt rootfs + BATS)
