React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don&#039;t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

[Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn).

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.
* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you&#039;re looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).

Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
* [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
* [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)
* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)
* [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)
* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Advanced Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)
* [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)
* [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community)
* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from &#039;react-dom/client&#039;;

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(&#039;container&#039;));
root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name=&quot;Taylor&quot; /&gt;);
```

This example will render &quot;Hello Taylor&quot; into a container on the page.

You&#039;ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.

#### *The Cyber Swiss Army Knife*

CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of &quot;cyber&quot; operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.

The tool is designed to enable both technical and non-technical analysts to manipulate data in complex ways without having to deal with complex tools or algorithms. It was conceived, designed, built and incrementally improved by an analyst in their 10% innovation time over several years.

## Live demo

CyberChef is still under active development. As a result, it shouldn&#039;t be considered a finished product. There is still testing and bug fixing to do, new features to be added and additional documentation to write. Please contribute!

Cryptographic operations in CyberChef should not be relied upon to provide security in any situation. No guarantee is offered for their correctness.

[A live demo can be found here][1] - have fun!

## Containers

If you would like to try out CyberChef locally you can either build it yourself:

```bash
docker build --tag cyberchef --ulimit nofile=10000 .
docker run -it -p 8080:80 cyberchef
```

Or you can use our image directly:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/gchq/cyberchef:latest
```

This image is built and published through our [GitHub Workflows](.github/workflows/releases.yml)

## How it works

There are four main areas in CyberChef:

 1. The **input** box in the top right, where you can paste, type or drag the text or file you want to operate on.
 2. The **output** box in the bottom right, where the outcome of your processing will be displayed.
 3. The **operations** list on the far left, where you can find all the operations that CyberChef is capable of in categorised lists, or by searching.
 4. The **recipe** area in the middle, where you can drag the operations that you want to use and specify arguments and options.

You can use as many operations as you like in simple or complex ways. Some examples are as follows:

 - [Decode a Base64-encoded string][2]
 - [Convert a date and time to a different time zone][3]
 - [Parse a Teredo IPv6 address][4]
 - [Convert data from a hexdump, then decompress][5]
 - [Decrypt and disassemble shellcode][6]
 - [Display multiple timestamps as full dates][7]
 - [Carry out different operations on data of different types][8]
 - [Use parts of the input as arguments to operations][9]
 - [Perform AES decryption, extracting the IV from the beginning of the cipher stream][10]
 - [Automagically detect several layers of nested encoding][12]


## Features

 - Drag and drop
     - Operations can be dragged in and out of the recipe list, or reorganised.
     - Files up to 2GB can be dragged over the input box to load them directly into the browser.
 - Auto Bake
     - Whenever you modify the input or the recipe, CyberChef will automatically &quot;bake&quot; for you and produce the output immediately.
     - This can be turned off and operated manually if it is affecting performance (if the input is very large, for instance).
 - Automated encoding detection
     - CyberChef uses [a number of techniques](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/wiki/Automatic-detection-of-encoded-data-using-CyberChef-Magic) to attempt to automatically detect which encodings your data is under. If it finds a suitable operation that make sense of your data, it displays the &#039;magic&#039; icon in the Output field which you can click to decode your data.
 - Breakpoints
     - You can set breakpoints on any operation in your recipe to pause execution before running it.
     - You can also step through the recipe one operation at a time to see what the data looks like at each stage.
 - Save and load recipes
     - If you come up with an awesome recipe that you know you’ll want to use again, just click &quot;Save recipe&quot; and add it to your local storage. It&#039;ll be waiting for you next time you visit CyberChef.
     - You can also copy the URL, which includes your recipe and input, to easily share it with others.
 - Search
     - If you know the name of the operation you want or a word associated with it, start typing it into the search field and any matching operations will immediately be shown.
 - Highlighting
     - When you highlight text in the input or output, the offset and length values will be displayed and, if possible, the corresponding data will be highlighted in the output or input respectively (example: [highlight the word &#039;question&#039; in the input to see where it appears in the output][11]).
 - Save to file and load from file
     - You can save the output to a file at any time or load a file by dragging and dropping it into the input field. Files up to around 2GB are supported (depending on your browser), however, some operations may take a very long time to run over this much data.
 - CyberChef is entirely client-side
     - It should be noted that none of your recipe configuration or input (either text or files) is ever sent to the CyberChef web server - all processing is carried out within your browser, on your own computer.
     - Due to this feature, CyberChef can be downloaded and run locally. You can use the link in the top left corner of the app to download a full copy of CyberChef and drop it into a virtual machine, share it with other people, or host it in a closed network.


## Deep linking

By manipulating CyberChef&#039;s URL hash, you can change the initial settings with which the page opens.

## About
**A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app**

The library works by launching the WhatsApp Web browser application and managing it using Puppeteer to create an instance of WhatsApp Web, thereby mitigating the risk of being blocked. The WhatsApp API client connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app, accessing its internal functions. This grants you access to nearly all the features available on WhatsApp Web, enabling dynamic handling similar to any other Node.js application.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn&#039;t be considered totally safe.**

## What is Label Studio?

&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

## Try out Label Studio

Install Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. Also you can try [Label Studio Teams](https://app.heartex.com).

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python &gt;=3.7 &lt;=3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you&#039;ve made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you&#039;re using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you&#039;re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

#### Run test suite
```bash
pip install -r deploy/requirements-test.txt
cd label_studio

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass)
DJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto
```


## What you get from Label Studio

![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it&#039;s tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/templates-categories.jpg&quot; /&gt;

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Model Context Protocol servers

This repository is a collection of *reference implementations* for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references
to community built servers and additional resources.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.
Each MCP server is implemented with either the [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

&gt; Note: Lists in this README are maintained in alphabetical order to minimize merge conflicts when adding new items.

## 部署
### 基于 Docker 进行部署
```shell
# 使用 SQLite 的部署命令：
docker run --name one-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/one-api:/data justsong/one-api
# 使用 MySQL 的部署命令，在上面的基础上添加 `-e SQL_DSN=&quot;root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi&quot;`，请自行修改数据库连接参数，不清楚如何修改请参见下面环境变量一节。
# 例如：
docker run --name one-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e SQL_DSN=&quot;root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi&quot; -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/one-api:/data justsong/one-api
```

其中，`-p 3000:3000` 中的第一个 `3000` 是宿主机的端口，可以根据需要进行修改。

数据和日志将会保存在宿主机的 `/home/ubuntu/data/one-api` 目录，请确保该目录存在且具有写入权限，或者更改为合适的目录。

如果启动失败，请添加 `--privileged=true`，具体参考 https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api/issues/482 。

如果上面的镜像无法拉取，可以尝试使用 GitHub 的 Docker 镜像，将上面的 `justsong/one-api` 替换为 `ghcr.io/songquanpeng/one-api` 即可。

如果你的并发量较大，**务必**设置 `SQL_DSN`，详见下面[环境变量](#环境变量)一节。

更新命令：`docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower -cR`

Nginx 的参考配置：
```
server{
   server_name openai.justsong.cn;  # 请根据实际情况修改你的域名

   location / {
          client_max_body_size  64m;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # 请根据实际情况修改你的端口
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
          proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
          proxy_read_timeout 300s;  # GPT-4 需要较长的超时时间，请自行调整
   }
}
```

之后使用 Let&#039;s Encrypt 的 certbot 配置 HTTPS：
```bash
# Ubuntu 安装 certbot：
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
# 生成证书 &amp; 修改 Nginx 配置
sudo certbot --nginx
# 根据指示进行操作
# 重启 Nginx
sudo service nginx restart
```

初始账号用户名为 `root`，密码为 `123456`。

### 通过宝塔面板进行一键部署
1. 安装宝塔面板9.2.0及以上版本，前往 [宝塔面板](https://www.bt.cn/new/download.html?r=dk_oneapi) 官网，选择正式版的脚本下载安装；
2. 安装后登录宝塔面板，在左侧菜单栏中点击 `Docker`，首次进入会提示安装 `Docker` 服务，点击立即安装，按提示完成安装；
3. 安装完成后在应用商店中搜索 `One-API`，点击安装，配置域名等基本信息即可完成安装；

### 基于 Docker Compose 进行部署

&gt; 仅启动方式不同，参数设置不变，请参考基于 Docker 部署部分

```shell
# 目前支持 MySQL 启动，数据存储在 ./data/mysql 文件夹内
docker-compose up -d

# 查看部署状态
docker-compose ps
```

### 手动部署
1. 从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api/releases/latest) 下载可执行文件或者从源码编译：
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api.git

   # 构建前端
   cd one-api/web/default
   npm install
   npm run build

   # 构建后端
   cd ../..
   go mod download
   go build -ldflags &quot;-s -w&quot; -o one-api
   ````
2. 运行：
   ```shell
   chmod u+x one-api
   ./one-api --port 3000 --log-dir ./logs
   ```
3. 访问 [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) 并登录。初始账号用户名为 `root`，密码为 `123456`。

更加详细的部署教程[参见此处](https://iamazing.cn/page/how-to-deploy-a-website)。

### 多机部署
1. 所有服务器 `SESSION_SECRET` 设置一样的值。
2. 必须设置 `SQL_DSN`，使用 MySQL 数据库而非 SQLite，所有服务器连接同一个数据库。
3. 所有从服务器必须设置 `NODE_TYPE` 为 `slave`，不设置则默认为主服务器。
4. 设置 `SYNC_FREQUENCY` 后服务器将定期从数据库同步配置，在使用远程数据库的情况下，推荐设置该项并启用 Redis，无论主从。
5. 从服务器可以选择设置 `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`，以重定向页面请求到主服务器。
6. 从服务器上**分别**装好 Redis，设置好 `REDIS_CONN_STRING`，这样可以做到在缓存未过期的情况下数据库零访问，可以减少延迟（Redis 集群或者哨兵模式的支持请参考环境变量说明）。
7. 如果主服务器访问数据库延迟也比较高，则也需要启用 Redis，并设置 `SYNC_FREQUENCY`，以定期从数据库同步配置。

环境变量的具体使用方法详见[此处](#环境变量)。

### 宝塔部署教程

详见 [#175](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api/issues/175)。

如果部署后访问出现空白页面，详见 [#97](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api/issues/97)。

### 部署第三方服务配合 One API 使用
&gt; 欢迎 PR 添加更多示例。

#### ChatGPT Next Web
项目主页：https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web

```bash
docker run --name chat-next-web -d -p 3001:3000 yidadaa/chatgpt-next-web
```

注意修改端口号，之后在页面上设置接口地址（例如：https://openai.justsong.cn/ ）和 API Key 即可。

#### ChatGPT Web
项目主页：https://github.com/Chanzhaoyu/chatgpt-web

```bash
docker run --name chatgpt-web -d -p 3002:3002 -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=https://openai.justsong.cn -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx chenzhaoyu94/chatgpt-web
```

注意修改端口号、`OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` 和 `OPENAI_API_KEY`。

#### QChatGPT - QQ机器人
项目主页：https://github.com/RockChinQ/QChatGPT

根据[文档](https://qchatgpt.rockchin.top)完成部署后，在 `data/provider.json`设置`requester.openai-chat-completions.base-url`为 One API 实例地址，并填写 API Key 到 `keys.openai` 组中，设置 `model` 为要使用的模型名称。

运行期间可以通过`!model`命令查看、切换可用模型。

### 部署到第三方平台
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;部署到 Sealos &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&gt; Sealos 的服务器在国外，不需要额外处理网络问题，支持高并发 &amp; 动态伸缩。

点击以下按钮一键部署（部署后访问出现 404 请等待 3~5 分钟）：

[![Deploy-on-Sealos.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labring-actions/templates/main/Deploy-on-Sealos.svg)](https://cloud.sealos.io/?openapp=system-fastdeploy?templateName=one-api)

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;部署到 Zeabur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&gt; Zeabur 的服务器在国外，自动解决了网络的问题，同时免费的额度也足够个人使用

[![Deploy on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/templates/7Q0KO3)

1. 首先 fork 一份代码。
2. 进入 [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com?referralCode=songquanpeng)，登录，进入控制台。
3. 新建一个 Project，在 Service -&gt; Add Service 选择 Marketplace，选择 MySQL，并记下连接参数（用户名、密码、地址、端口）。
4. 复制链接参数，运行 ```create database `one-api` ``` 创建数据库。
5. 然后在 Service -&gt; Add Service，选择 Git（第一次使用需要先授权），选择你 fork 的仓库。
6. Deploy 会自动开始，先取消。进入下方 Variable，添加一个 `PORT`，值为 `3000`，再添加一个 `SQL_DSN`，值为 `&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@tcp(&lt;addr&gt;:&lt;port&gt;)/one-api` ，然后保存。 注意如果不填写 `SQL_DSN`，数据将无法持久化，重新部署后数据会丢失。
7. 选择 Redeploy。
8. 进入下方 Domains，选择一个合适的域名前缀，如 &quot;my-one-api&quot;，最终域名为 &quot;my-one-api.zeabur.app&quot;，也可以 CNAME 自己的域名。
9. 等待部署完成，点击生成的域名进入 One API。

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;部署到 Render&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&gt; Render 提供免费额度，绑卡后可以进一步提升额度

Render 可以直接部署 docker 镜像，不需要 fork 仓库：https://dashboard.render.com

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

## 配置
系统本身开箱即用。

你可以通过设置环境变量或者命令行参数进行配置。

等到系统启动后，使用 `root` 用户登录系统并做进一步的配置。

**Note**：如果你不知道某个配置项的含义，可以临时删掉值以看到进一步的提示文字。

## 使用方法
在`渠道`页面中添加你的 API Key，之后在`令牌`页面中新增访问令牌。

之后就可以使用你的令牌访问 One API 了，使用方式与 [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) 一致。

你需要在各种用到 OpenAI API 的地方设置 API Base 为你的 One API 的部署地址，例如：`https://openai.justsong.cn`，API Key 则为你在 One API 中生成的令牌。

注意，具体的 API Base 的格式取决于你所使用的客户端。

例如对于 OpenAI 的官方库：
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;sk-xxxxxx&quot;
OPENAI_API_BASE=&quot;https://&lt;HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/v1&quot;
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(用户)
    A ---&gt;|使用 One API 分发的 key 进行请求| B(One API)
    B --&gt;|中继请求| C(OpenAI)
    B --&gt;|中继请求| D(Azure)
    B --&gt;|中继请求| E(其他 OpenAI API 格式下游渠道)
    B --&gt;|中继并修改请求体和返回体| F(非 OpenAI API 格式下游渠道)
```

可以通过在令牌后面添加渠道 ID 的方式指定使用哪一个渠道处理本次请求，例如：`Authorization: Bearer ONE_API_KEY-CHANNEL_ID`。
注意，需要是管理员用户创建的令牌才能指定渠道 ID。

不加的话将会使用负载均衡的方式使用多个渠道。

### 环境变量
&gt; One API 支持从 `.env` 文件中读取环境变量，请参照 `.env.example` 文件，使用时请将其重命名为 `.env`。
1. `REDIS_CONN_STRING`：设置之后将使用 Redis 作为缓存使用。
   + 例子：`REDIS_CONN_STRING=redis://default:redispw@localhost:49153`
   + 如果数据库访问延迟很低，没有必要启用 Redis，启用后反而会出现数据滞后的问题。
   + 如果需要使用哨兵或者集群模式：
     + 则需要把该环境变量设置为节点列表，例如：`localhost:49153,localhost:49154,localhost:49155`。
     + 除此之外还需要设置以下环境变量：
       + `REDIS_PASSWORD`：Redis 集群或者哨兵模式下的密码设置。
       + `REDIS_MASTER_NAME`：Redis 哨兵模式下主节点的名称。
2. `SESSION_SECRET`：设置之后将使用固定的会话密钥，这样系统重新启动后已登录用户的 cookie 将依旧有效。
   + 例子：`SESSION_SECRET=random_string`
3. `SQL_DSN`：设置之后将使用指定数据库而非 SQLite，请使用 MySQL 或 PostgreSQL。
   + 例子：
     + MySQL：`SQL_DSN=root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi`
     + PostgreSQL：`SQL_DSN=postgres://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/oneapi`（适配中，欢迎反馈）
   + 注意需要提前建立数据库 `oneapi`，无需手动建表，程序将自动建表。
   + 如果使用本地数据库：部署命令可添加 `--network=&quot;host&quot;` 以使得容器内的程序可以访问到宿主机上的 MySQL。
   + 如果使用云数据库：如果云服务器需要验证身份，需要在连接参数中添加 `?tls=skip-verify`。
   + 请根据你的数据库配置修改下列参数（或者保持默认值）：
     + `SQL_MAX_IDLE_CONNS`：最大空闲连接数，默认为 `100`。
     + `SQL_MAX_OPEN_CONNS`：最大打开连接数，默认为 `1000`。
       + 如果报错 `Error 1040: Too many connections`，请适当减小该值。
     + `SQL_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME`：连接的最大生命周期，默认为 `60`，单位分钟。
4. `LOG_SQL_DSN`：设置之后将为 `logs` 表使用独立的数据库，请使用 MySQL 或 PostgreSQL。
5. `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`：设置之后将重定向页面请求到指定的地址，仅限从服务器设置。
   + 例子：`FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://openai.justsong.cn`
6. `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED`：启用内存缓存，会导致用户额度的更新存在一定的延迟，可选值为 `true` 和 `false`，未设置则默认为 `false`。
   + 例子：`MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED=true`
7. `SYNC_FREQUENCY`：在启用缓存的情况下与数据库同步配置的频率，单位为秒，默认为 `600` 秒。
   + 例子：`SYNC_FREQUENCY=60`
8. `NODE_TYPE`：设置之后将指定节点类型，可选值为 `master` 和 `slave`，未设置则默认为 `master`。
   + 例子：`NODE_TYPE=slave`
9. `CHANNEL_UPDATE_FREQUENCY`：设置之后将定期更新渠道余额，单位为分钟，未设置则不进行更新。
   + 例子：`CHANNEL_UPDATE_FREQUENCY=1440`
10. `CHANNEL_TEST_FREQUENCY`：设置之后将定期检查渠道，单位为分钟，未设置则不进行检查。 
   +例子：`CHANNEL_TEST_FREQUENCY=1440`
11. `POLLING_INTERVAL`：批量更新渠道余额以及测试可用性时的请求间隔，单位为秒，默认无间隔。
    + 例子：`POLLING_INTERVAL=5`
12. `BATCH_UPDATE_ENABLED`：启用数据库批量更新聚合，会导致用户额度的更新存在一定的延迟可选值为 `true` 和 `false`，未设置则默认为 `false`。
    + 例子：`BATCH_UPDATE_ENABLED=true`
    + 如果你遇到了数据库连接数过多的问题，可以尝试启用该选项。
13. `BATCH_UPDATE_INTERVAL=5`：批量更新聚合的时间间隔，单位为秒，默认为 `5`。
    + 例子：`BATCH_UPDATE_INTERVAL=5`
14. 请求频率限制：
    + `GLOBAL_API_RATE_LIMIT`：全局 API 速率限制（除中继请求外），单 ip 三分钟内的最大请求数，默认为 `180`。
    + `GLOBAL_WEB_RATE_LIMIT`：全局 Web 速率限制，单 ip 三分钟内的最大请求数，默认为 `60`。
15. 编码器缓存设置：
    + `TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR`：默认程序启动时会联网下载一些通用的词元的编码，如：`gpt-3.5-turbo`，在一些网络环境不稳定，或者离线情况，可能会导致启动有问题，可以配置此目录缓存数据，可迁移到离线环境。
    + `DATA_GYM_CACHE_DIR`：目前该配置作用与 `TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR` 一致，但是优先级没有它高。
16. `RELAY_TIMEOUT`：中继超时设置，单位为秒，默认不设置超时时间。
17. `RELAY_PROXY`：设置后使用该代理来请求 API。

23. `THEME`：系统的主题设置，默认为 `default`，具体可选值参考[此处](./web/README.md)。
24. `ENABLE_METRIC`：是否根据请求成功率禁用渠道，默认不开启，可选值为 `true` 和 `false`。
25. `METRIC_QUEUE_SIZE`：请求成功率统计队列大小，默认为 `10`。
26. `METRIC_SUCCESS_RATE_THRESHOLD`：请求成功率阈值，默认为 `0.8`。
27. `INITIAL_ROOT_TOKEN`：如果设置了该值，则在系统首次启动时会自动创建一个值为该环境变量值的 root 用户令牌。
28. `INITIAL_ROOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`：如果设置了该值，则在系统首次启动时会自动创建一个值为该环境变量的 root 用户创建系统管理令牌。

## 常见问题
1. 额度是什么？怎么计算的？One API 的额度计算有问题？
   + 额度 = 分组倍率 * 模型倍率 * （提示 token 数 + 补全 token 数 * 补全倍率）
   + 其中补全倍率对于 GPT3.5 固定为 1.33，GPT4 为 2，与官方保持一致。
   + 如果是非流模式，官方接口会返回消耗的总 token，但是你要注意提示和补全的消耗倍率不一样。
   + 注意，One API 的默认倍率就是官方倍率，是已经调整过的。
2. 账户额度足够为什么提示额度不足？
   + 请检查你的令牌额度是否足够，这个和账户额度是分开的。
   + 令牌额度仅供用户设置最大使用量，用户可自由设置。
3. 提示无可用渠道？
   + 请检查的用户分组和渠道分组设置。
   + 以及渠道的模型设置。
4. 渠道测试报错：`invalid character &#039;&lt;&#039; looking for beginning of value`
   + 这是因为返回值不是合法的 JSON，而是一个 HTML 页面。
   + 大概率是你的部署站的 IP 或代理的节点被 CloudFlare 封禁了。
5. ChatGPT Next Web 报错：`Failed to fetch`
   + 部署的时候不要设置 `BASE_URL`。
   + 检查你的接口地址和 API Key 有没有填对。
   + 检查是否启用了 HTTPS，浏览器会拦截 HTTPS 域名下的 HTTP 请求。
6. 报错：`当前分组负载已饱和，请稍后再试`
   + 上游渠道 429 了。
7. 升级之后我的数据会丢失吗？
   + 如果使用 MySQL，不会。
   + 如果使用 SQLite，需要按照我所给的部署命令挂载 volume 持久化 one-api.db 数据库文件，否则容器重启后数据会丢失。
8. 升级之前数据库需要做变更吗？
   + 一般情况下不需要，系统将在初始化的时候自动调整。
   + 如果需要的话，我会在更新日志中说明，并给出脚本。
9. 手动修改数据库后报错：`数据库一致性已被破坏，请联系管理员`？
   + 这是检测到 ability 表里有些记录的渠道 id 是不存在的，这大概率是因为你删了 channel 表里的记录但是没有同步在 ability 表里清理无效的渠道。
   + 对于每一个渠道，其所支持的模型都需要有一个专门的 ability 表的记录，表示该渠道支持该模型。

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; ℹ️ **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected
&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

## Act as an Ethereum Developer

Contributed by: [@ameya-2003](https://github.com/Ameya-2003) Reference:
[The BlockChain Messenger](https://github.com/Ameya-2003/BlockChain/blob/main/Projects/The%20BlockChain%20Messenger.sol)

&gt; Imagine you are an experienced Ethereum developer tasked with creating a smart
&gt; contract for a blockchain messenger. The objective is to save messages on the
&gt; blockchain, making them readable (public) to everyone, writable (private) only
&gt; to the person who deployed the contract, and to count how many times the
&gt; message was updated. Develop a Solidity smart contract for this purpose,
&gt; including the necessary functions and considerations for achieving the
&gt; specified goals. Please provide the code and any relevant explanations to
&gt; ensure a clear understanding of the implementation.

[**NodeBB Forum Software**](https://nodebb.org) is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. NodeBB takes the best of the modern web: real-time streaming discussions, mobile responsiveness, and rich RESTful read/write APIs, while staying true to the original bulletin board/forum format &amp;rarr; categorical hierarchies, local user accounts, and asynchronous messaging.

NodeBB by itself contains a &quot;common core&quot; of basic functionality, while additional functionality and integrations are enabled through the use of third-party plugins.

## How can I follow along/contribute?

* If you are a developer, feel free to check out the source and submit pull requests. We also have a wide array of [plugins](http://community.nodebb.org/category/7/nodebb-plugins) which would be a great starting point for learning the codebase.
* If you are a designer, [NodeBB needs themes](http://community.nodebb.org/category/10/nodebb-themes)! NodeBB&#039;s theming system allows extension of the base templates as well as styling via SCSS or CSS. NodeBB&#039;s base theme utilizes [Bootstrap 5](http://getbootstrap.com/) as a frontend toolkit.
* If you know languages other than English you can help us translate NodeBB. We use [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/nodebb/nodebb/) for internationalization.
* Please don&#039;t forget to **like**, **follow**, and **star our repo**! Join our growing [community](http://community.nodebb.org) to keep up to date with the latest NodeBB development.

## Requirements

NodeBB requires the following software to be installed:

* A version of Node.js at least 20 or greater ([installation/upgrade instructions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions))
* MongoDB, version 3.6 or greater **or** Redis, version 2.8.9 or greater
* If you are using [clustering](https://docs.nodebb.org/configuring/scaling/) you need Redis installed and configured.
* nginx, version 1.3.13 or greater (**only if** intending to use nginx to proxy requests to a NodeBB)

## Installation

[Please refer to platform-specific installation documentation](https://docs.nodebb.org/installing/os).
If installing via the cloud (or using Docker), [please see cloud-based installation documentation](https://docs.nodebb.org/installing/cloud/).

## Securing NodeBB

It is important to ensure that your NodeBB and database servers are secured. Bear these points in mind:

1. While some distributions set up Redis with a more restrictive configuration, Redis by default listens to all interfaces, which is especially dangerous when a server is open to the public. Some suggestions:
    * Set `bind_address` to `127.0.0.1` so as to restrict access  to the local machine only
    * Use `requirepass` to secure Redis behind a password (preferably a long one)
    * Familiarise yourself with [Redis Security](http://redis.io/topics/security)
2. Use `iptables` to secure your server from unintended open ports. In Ubuntu, `ufw` provides a friendlier interface to working with `iptables`.
    * e.g. If your NodeBB is proxied, no ports should be open except 80 (and possibly 22, for SSH access)

## Overview

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Documentation site is in production here : https://fast-agent.ai. Feel free to feed back what&#039;s helpful and what&#039;s not. There is also an LLMs.txt [here](https://fast-agent.ai/llms.txt)

**`fast-agent`** enables you to create and interact with sophisticated Agents and Workflows in minutes. It is the first framework with complete, end-to-end tested MCP Feature support including Sampling. Both Anthropic (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) and OpenAI models (gpt-4o/gpt-4.1 family, o1/o3 family) are supported.

The simple declarative syntax lets you concentrate on composing your Prompts and MCP Servers to [build effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents).

`fast-agent` is multi-modal, supporting Images and PDFs for both Anthropic and OpenAI endpoints via Prompts, Resources and MCP Tool Call results. The inclusion of passthrough and playback LLMs enable rapid development and test of Python glue-code for your applications.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt;
&gt; `fast-agent` The fast-agent documentation repo is here: https://github.com/evalstate/fast-agent-docs. Please feel free to submit PRs for documentation, experience reports or other content you think others may find helpful. All help and feedback warmly received.

### Agent Application Development

Prompts and configurations that define your Agent Applications are stored in simple files, with minimal boilerplate, enabling simple management and version control.

Chat with individual Agents and Components before, during and after workflow execution to tune and diagnose your application. Agents can request human input to get additional context for task completion.

Simple model selection makes testing Model &lt;-&gt; MCP Server interaction painless. You can read more about the motivation behind this project [here](https://llmindset.co.uk/resources/fast-agent/)

![2025-03-23-fast-agent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f6dbb69-43e3-4633-8e12-5572e9614728)

## Get started:

Start by installing the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python. Then:

```bash
uv pip install fast-agent-mcp          # install fast-agent!

uv run fast-agent setup                # create an example agent and config files
uv run agent.py                        # run your first agent
uv run agent.py --model=o3-mini.low    # specify a model
uv run fast-agent quickstart workflow  # create &quot;building effective agents&quot; examples
```

Other quickstart examples include a Researcher Agent (with Evaluator-Optimizer workflow) and Data Analysis Agent (similar to the ChatGPT experience), demonstrating MCP Roots support.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Windows Users - there are a couple of configuration changes needed for the Filesystem and Docker MCP Servers - necessary changes are detailed within the configuration files.

### Basic Agents

Defining an agent is as simple as:

```python
@fast.agent(
  instruction=&quot;Given an object, respond only with an estimate of its size.&quot;
)
```

We can then send messages to the Agent:

```python
async with fast.run() as agent:
  moon_size = await agent(&quot;the moon&quot;)
  print(moon_size)
```

Or start an interactive chat with the Agent:

```python
async with fast.run() as agent:
  await agent.interactive()
```

Here is the complete `sizer.py` Agent application, with boilerplate code:

```python
import asyncio
from mcp_agent.core.fastagent import FastAgent

# Create the application
fast = FastAgent(&quot;Agent Example&quot;)

@fast.agent(
  instruction=&quot;Given an object, respond only with an estimate of its size.&quot;
)
async def main():
  async with fast.run() as agent:
    await agent.interactive()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The Agent can then be run with `uv run sizer.py`.

Specify a model with the `--model` switch - for example `uv run sizer.py --model sonnet`.

### Combining Agents and using MCP Servers

_To generate examples use `fast-agent quickstart workflow`. This example can be run with `uv run workflow/chaining.py`. fast-agent looks for configuration files in the current directory before checking parent directories recursively._

Agents can be chained to build a workflow, using MCP Servers defined in the `fastagent.config.yaml` file:

```python
@fast.agent(
    &quot;url_fetcher&quot;,
    &quot;Given a URL, provide a complete and comprehensive summary&quot;,
    servers=[&quot;fetch&quot;], # Name of an MCP Server defined in fastagent.config.yaml
)
@fast.agent(
    &quot;social_media&quot;,
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Write a 280 character social media post for any given text.
    Respond only with the post, never use hashtags.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;,
)
@fast.chain(
    name=&quot;post_writer&quot;,
    sequence=[&quot;url_fetcher&quot;, &quot;social_media&quot;],
)
async def main():
    async with fast.run() as agent:
        # using chain workflow
        await agent.post_writer(&quot;http://llmindset.co.uk&quot;)
```

All Agents and Workflows respond to `.send(&quot;message&quot;)` or `.prompt()` to begin a chat session.

Saved as `social.py` we can now run this workflow from the command line with:

```bash
uv run workflow/chaining.py --agent post_writer --message &quot;&lt;url&gt;&quot;
```

Add the `--quiet` switch to disable progress and message display and return only the final response - useful for simple automations.

## Workflows

### Chain

The `chain` workflow offers a more declarative approach to calling Agents in sequence:

```python

@fast.chain(
  &quot;post_writer&quot;,
   sequence=[&quot;url_fetcher&quot;,&quot;social_media&quot;]
)

# we can them prompt it directly:
async with fast.run() as agent:
  await agent.post_writer()

```

This starts an interactive session, which produces a short social media post for a given URL. If a _chain_ is prompted it returns to a chat with last Agent in the chain. You can switch the agent to prompt by typing `@agent-name`.

Chains can be incorporated in other workflows, or contain other workflow elements (including other Chains). You can set an `instruction` to precisely describe it&#039;s capabilities to other workflow steps if needed.

### Human Input

Agents can request Human Input to assist with a task or get additional context:

```python
@fast.agent(
    instruction=&quot;An AI agent that assists with basic tasks. Request Human Input when needed.&quot;,
    human_input=True,
)

await agent(&quot;print the next number in the sequence&quot;)
```

In the example `human_input.py`, the Agent will prompt the User for additional information to complete the task.

### Parallel

The Parallel Workflow sends the same message to multiple Agents simultaneously (`fan-out`), then uses the `fan-in` Agent to process the combined content.

```python
@fast.agent(&quot;translate_fr&quot;, &quot;Translate the text to French&quot;)
@fast.agent(&quot;translate_de&quot;, &quot;Translate the text to German&quot;)
@fast.agent(&quot;translate_es&quot;, &quot;Translate the text to Spanish&quot;)

@fast.parallel(
  name=&quot;translate&quot;,
  fan_out=[&quot;translate_fr&quot;,&quot;translate_de&quot;,&quot;translate_es&quot;]
)

@fast.chain(
  &quot;post_writer&quot;,
   sequence=[&quot;url_fetcher&quot;,&quot;social_media&quot;,&quot;translate&quot;]
)
```

If you don&#039;t specify a `fan-in` agent, the `parallel` returns the combined Agent results verbatim.

`parallel` is also useful to ensemble ideas from different LLMs.

When using `parallel` in other workflows, specify an `instruction` to describe its operation.

### Evaluator-Optimizer

Evaluator-Optimizers combine 2 agents: one to generate content (the `generator`), and the other to judge that content and provide actionable feedback (the `evaluator`). Messages are sent to the generator first, then the pair run in a loop until either the evaluator is satisfied with the quality, or the maximum number of refinements is reached. The final result from the Generator is returned.

If the Generator has `use_history` off, the previous iteration is returned when asking for improvements - otherwise conversational context is used.

```python
@fast.evaluator_optimizer(
  name=&quot;researcher&quot;,
  generator=&quot;web_searcher&quot;,
  evaluator=&quot;quality_assurance&quot;,
  min_rating=&quot;EXCELLENT&quot;,
  max_refinements=3
)

async with fast.run() as agent:
  await agent.researcher.send(&quot;produce a report on how to make the perfect espresso&quot;)
```

When used in a workflow, it returns the last `generator` message as the result.

See the `evaluator.py` workflow example, or `fast-agent quickstart researcher` for a more complete example.

### Router

Routers use an LLM to assess a message, and route it to the most appropriate Agent. The routing prompt is automatically generated based on the Agent instructions and available Servers.

```python
@fast.router(
  name=&quot;route&quot;,
  agents=[&quot;agent1&quot;,&quot;agent2&quot;,&quot;agent3&quot;]
)
```

Look at the `router.py` workflow for an example.

### Orchestrator

Given a complex task, the Orchestrator uses an LLM to generate a plan to divide the task amongst the available Agents. The planning and aggregation prompts are generated by the Orchestrator, which benefits from using more capable models. Plans can either be built once at the beginning (`plantype=&quot;full&quot;`) or iteratively (`plantype=&quot;iterative&quot;`).

```python
@fast.orchestrator(
  name=&quot;orchestrate&quot;,
  agents=[&quot;task1&quot;,&quot;task2&quot;,&quot;task3&quot;]
)
```

See the `orchestrator.py` or `agent_build.py` workflow example.

## Agent Features

### Calling Agents

All definitions allow omitting the name and instructions arguments for brevity:

```python
@fast.agent(&quot;You are a helpful agent&quot;)          # Create an agent with a default name.
@fast.agent(&quot;greeter&quot;,&quot;Respond cheerfully!&quot;)    # Create an agent with the name &quot;greeter&quot;

moon_size = await agent(&quot;the moon&quot;)             # Call the default (first defined agent) with a message

result = await agent.greeter(&quot;Good morning!&quot;)   # Send a message to an agent by name using dot notation
result = await agent.greeter.send(&quot;Hello!&quot;)     # You can call &#039;send&#039; explicitly

await agent.greeter()                           # If no message is specified, a chat session will open
await agent.greeter.prompt()                    # that can be made more explicit
await agent.greeter.prompt(default_prompt=&quot;OK&quot;) # and supports setting a default prompt

agent[&quot;greeter&quot;].send(&quot;Good Evening!&quot;)          # Dictionary access is supported if preferred
```

### Defining Agents

#### Basic Agent

```python
@fast.agent(
  name=&quot;agent&quot;,                          # name of the agent
  instruction=&quot;You are a helpful Agent&quot;, # base instruction for the agent
  servers=[&quot;filesystem&quot;],                # list of MCP Servers for the agent
  model=&quot;o3-mini.high&quot;,                  # specify a model for the agent

  name=&quot;parallel&quot;,                       # name of the parallel workflow
  fan_out=[&quot;agent1&quot;, &quot;agent2&quot;],          # list of agents to run in parallel
  fan_in=&quot;aggregator&quot;,                   # name of agent that combines results (optional)
  instruction=&quot;instruction&quot;,             # instruction to describe the parallel for other workflows
  include_request=True,                  # include original request in fan-in message
)
```

#### Evaluator-Optimizer

```python
@fast.evaluator_optimizer(
  name=&quot;researcher&quot;,                     # name of the workflow
  generator=&quot;web_searcher&quot;,              # name of the content generator agent
  evaluator=&quot;quality_assurance&quot;,         # name of the evaluator agent
  min_rating=&quot;GOOD&quot;,                     # minimum acceptable quality (EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, POOR)

  human_input=False,                     # whether orchestrator can request human input
  plan_type=&quot;full&quot;,                      # planning approach: &quot;full&quot; or &quot;iterative&quot;
  max_iterations=5,                      # maximum number of full plan attempts, or iterations
)
```

### Multimodal Support

Add Resources to prompts using either the inbuilt `prompt-server` or MCP Types directly. Convenience class are made available to do so simply, for example:

```python
  summary: str =  await agent.with_resource(
      &quot;Summarise this PDF please&quot;,
      &quot;mcp_server&quot;,
      &quot;resource://fast-agent/sample.pdf&quot;,
  )
```

#### MCP Tool Result Conversion

LLM APIs have restrictions on the content types that can be returned as Tool Calls/Function results via their Chat Completions API&#039;s:

- OpenAI supports Text
- Anthropic supports Text and Image

For MCP Tool Results, `ImageResources` and `EmbeddedResources` are converted to User Messages and added to the conversation.

### Prompts

MCP Prompts are supported with `apply_prompt(name,arguments)`, which always returns an Assistant Message. If the last message from the MCP Server is a &#039;User&#039; message, it is sent to the LLM for processing. Prompts applied to the Agent&#039;s Context are retained - meaning that with `use_history=False`, Agents can act as finely tuned responders.

Prompts can also be applied interactively through the interactive interface by using the `/prompt` command.

### Sampling

Sampling LLMs are configured per Client/Server pair. Specify the model name in fastagent.config.yaml as follows:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    sampling_resource:
      command: &quot;uv&quot;
      args: [&quot;run&quot;, &quot;sampling_resource_server.py&quot;]
      sampling:
        model: &quot;haiku&quot;
```

### Secrets File

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; fast-agent will look recursively for a fastagent.secrets.yaml file, so you only need to manage this at the root folder of your agent definitions.

### Interactive Shell

## Project Notes

`fast-agent` builds on the [`mcp-agent`](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent) project by Sarmad Qadri.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>About
-----
draw.io, this project, is a configurable diagramming/whiteboarding visualization application. draw.io is jointly owned and developed by JGraph Ltd and draw.io AG.

As well as running this project, we run a production-grade deployment of the diagramming interface at https://app.diagrams.net.

Scope of the Project
--------------------

draw.io is a diagramming or whiteboarding application, depending on which theme is selected. It is not an SVG editing app, the SVG export is designed only for embedding in web pages, not for further editing in other tools.

The application is designed to be entirely as-is. draw.io is not suitable as a framework for building other products from, as source code is not provided. For this try either [Tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) or [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).

Note, in particular, we don&#039;t have support for collaborative editing in this project. If this is important, one of the projects above is likely a better choice.

If you are using a draw.io project/product and have issues or questions about the editor itself, the issue tracker and discussion in this GitHub project are likely a good place to look.

Running
-------

One way to run draw.io is to fork this project, [publish the master branch to GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) and the [pages sites](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) will have the full editor functionality (sans the integrations).

Another way is to use [the recommended Docker project](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio) or to download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net).

The full packaged .war of the client and servlets is built when the project is tagged and available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).

Supported Browsers
------------------

draw.io supports Chrome 98+, Firefox 94+, Safari 15.4+, Opera 84+, WebView Android 98+, Safari iOS 15.4+ and Edge 98+.

Logo and trademark usage
------------------------

draw.io is a registered EU trademark, #018062448

Do not use the draw.io name or any draw.io logo in a way that suggests you are JGraph, your offering or project is by JGraph, or that JGraph is endorsing you or your offering or project.

# Introduction

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) designed to teach web
application security lessons.

This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The
exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and
penetration testing techniques.

**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
this program.*  WebGoat&#039;s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
the exposure.

**WARNING 2:** *This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
first thing that all hackers claim.*

# Installation instructions:

For more details check [the Contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 1. Run using Docker

Already have a browser and ZAP and/or Burp installed on your machine in this case you can run the WebGoat image directly using Docker.

Every release is also published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/webgoat/webgoat).

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 webgoat/webgoat
```

For some lessons you need the container run in the same timezone. For this you can set the TZ environment variable.
E.g.

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

If you want to use OWASP ZAP or another proxy, you can no longer use 127.0.0.1 or localhost. but
you can use custom host entries. For example:

```shell
127.0.0.1 www.webgoat.local www.webwolf.local
```

Then you can run the container with:

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e WEBGOAT_HOST=www.webgoat.local -e WEBWOLF_HOST=www.webwolf.local -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

Then visit http://www.webgoat.local:8080/WebGoat/ and http://www.webwolf.local:9090/WebWolf/

## 2. Run using Docker with complete Linux Desktop

Instead of installing tools locally we have a complete Docker image based on running a desktop in your browser. This way you only have to run a Docker image which will give you the best user experience.

```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 webgoat/webgoat-desktop
```

## 3. Standalone

Download the latest WebGoat release from [https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases)

```shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar
```

Click the link in the log to start WebGoat.

### 3.1 Running on a different port

If for some reason you want to run WebGoat on a different port, you can do so by adding the following parameter:

```shell
java -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar --webgoat.port=8001 --webwolf.port=8002
```

For a full overview of all the parameters you can use, please check the [WebGoat properties file](webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application-{webgoat, webwolf}.properties).

## 4. Run from the sources

### Prerequisites:

* Java 23
* Your favorite IDE
* Git, or Git support in your IDE

Open a command shell/window:

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:WebGoat/WebGoat.git
```

Now let&#039;s start by compiling the project.

```Shell
cd WebGoat
git checkout &lt;&lt;branch_name&gt;&gt;
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw clean install

# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd clean install

# Using docker or podman, you can than build the container locally
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t webgoat/webgoat
```

Now we are ready to run the project. WebGoat is using Spring Boot.

```Shell
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

```

... you should be running WebGoat on http://localhost:8080/WebGoat momentarily.

Note: The above link will redirect you to login page if you are not logged in. LogIn/Create account to proceed.

To change the IP address add the following variable to the `WebGoat/webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

```
server.address=x.x.x.x
```

## 4. Run with custom menu

For specialist only. There is a way to set up WebGoat with a personalized menu. You can leave out some menu categories or individual lessons by setting certain environment variables.

For instance running as a jar on a Linux/macOS it will look like this:

```Shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
export EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot;
export EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot;
java -jar target/webgoat-2023.8-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Or in a docker run it would (once this version is pushed into docker hub) look like this:

```Shell
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot; -e EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot; webgoat/webgoat
```
