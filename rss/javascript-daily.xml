### Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?

Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don&#039;t plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.

Documentation is still available but it&#039;s moved to
[https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0) and
[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

***

uBlock Origin (uBO) is a CPU and memory-efficient [wide-spectrum content blocker][Blocking] for Chromium and Firefox. It blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, annoying anti-blockers, malware sites, etc., by default using [EasyList][EasyList], [EasyPrivacy][EasyPrivacy], [Peter Lowe&#039;s Blocklist][Peter Lowe&#039;s Blocklist], [Online Malicious URL Blocklist][Malicious Blocklist], and uBO [filter lists][uBO Filters]. There are many other lists available to block even more. Hosts files are also supported. uBO uses the EasyList filter syntax and [extends][Extended Syntax] the syntax to work with custom rules and filters.

You may easily unselect any preselected filter lists if you think uBO blocks too much. For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only EasyList, ABP filters, and Acceptable Ads enabled by default.

It is important to note that using a blocker is **NOT** [theft]. Do not fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of `blocking = theft` is the criminalization of the inalienable right to privacy.

Ads, &quot;unintrusive&quot; or not, are just the visible portion of the privacy-invading means entering your browser when you visit most sites. **uBO&#039;s primary goal is to help users neutralize these privacy-invading methods** in a way that welcomes those users who do not wish to use more technical means.

### 🤖 Custom Agents

Custom agents can be used in Copilot coding agent (CCA), VS Code, and Copilot CLI (coming soon). For CCA, when assigning an issue to Copilot, select the custom agent from the provided list. In VS Code, you can activate the custom agent in the agents session, alongside built-in agents like Plan and Agent.

### 🎯 Prompts

Use the `/` command in GitHub Copilot Chat to access prompts:

```plaintext
/awesome-copilot create-readme
```

### 📋 Instructions

Instructions automatically apply to files based on their patterns and provide contextual guidance for coding standards, frameworks, and best practices.

# ⚠️ Important Note: Avoiding Data Loss and Self-Hosting

# Background:

Our open-source project is currently hosted on a remote server, where we are forced to reset the entire server, **including the file system and MongoDB database**, every **2 hours** to avoid incurring additional costs.

This process results in the **deletion of all image/static files and a reset of the entire database on the server.**

## What does this mean for you?

**Data Loss:**
Any changes made during the 2-hour interval (on the remote server), including uploaded images and user data, will be lost and unrecoverable.

**Service Interruption:**
The server reset might disrupt your development and testing processes for a certain duration while the server is rebooting (for 1-2 minutes).

## Recommended Solutions:

**Local API Usage:**
For development and testing purposes, we strongly recommend using the API locally on your machine by **cloning the project**.

This ensures that your work is not affected by the server resets and allows you to maintain a stable development environment on your local machine.

**Self-Hosting on Railway _(recommended for personal projects)_:**
To self-host the FreeAPI.app application, you can take advantage of a pre-built template that is readily available.

If you encounter issues, check the [FAQ](https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft/blob/main/FAQ.md) or find support on [discord](https://discord.gg/mp73p35dzC). We are currently not very responsive to github issues. To run tasks please refer to [Minecollab Instructions](minecollab.md#installation)

## Tasks

Bot performance can be roughly evaluated with Tasks. Tasks automatically intialize bots with a goal to aquire specific items or construct predefined buildings, and remove the bot once the goal is achieved.

To run tasks, you need python, pip, and optionally conda. You can then install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Tasks are defined in json files in the `tasks` folder, and can be run with: `python tasks/run_task_file.py --task_path=tasks/example_tasks.json`

For full evaluations, you will need to [download and install the task suite. Full instructions.](minecollab.md#installation)

## Model Customization

You can configure project details in `settings.js`. [See file.](settings.js)

You can configure the agent&#039;s name, model, and prompts in their profile like `andy.json` with the `model` field. For comprehensive details, see [Model Specifications](#model-specifications).

If you use Ollama, to install the models used by default (generation and embedding), execute the following terminal command:
`ollama pull sweaterdog/andy-4:micro-q8_0 &amp;&amp; ollama pull embeddinggemma`

To use Azure, you can reuse the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get the key from the Azure portal. See [azure.json](profiles/azure.json) for an example.

### Online Servers
To connect to online servers your bot will need an official Microsoft/Minecraft account. You can use your own personal one, but will need another account if you want to connect too and play with it. To connect, change these lines in `settings.js`:
```javascript
&quot;host&quot;: &quot;111.222.333.444&quot;,
&quot;port&quot;: 55920,
&quot;auth&quot;: &quot;microsoft&quot;,

// rest is same...
```
&gt; [!Important]
&gt; The bot&#039;s name in the profile.json must exactly match the Minecraft profile name! Otherwise the bot will spam talk to itself.

To use different accounts, Mindcraft will connect with the account that the Minecraft launcher is currently using. You can switch accounts in the launcer, then run `node main.js`, then switch to your main account after the bot has connected.

### Docker Container

If you intend to `allow_insecure_coding`, it is a good idea to run the app in a docker container to reduce risks of running unknown code. This is strongly recommended before connecting to remote servers.

```bash
docker run -i -t --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app -p 3000-3003:3000-3003 node:latest node main.js
```
or simply
```bash
docker-compose up
```

When running in docker, if you want the bot to join your local minecraft server, you have to use a special host address `host.docker.internal` to call your localhost from inside your docker container. Put this into your [settings.js](settings.js):

```javascript
&quot;host&quot;: &quot;host.docker.internal&quot;, // instead of &quot;localhost&quot;, to join your local minecraft from inside the docker container
```

To connect to an unsupported minecraft version, you can try to use [viaproxy](services/viaproxy/README.md)

# Bot Profiles

Bot profiles are json files (such as `andy.json`) that define:

1. Bot backend LLMs to use for talking, coding, and embedding.
2. Prompts used to influence the bot&#039;s behavior.
3. Examples help the bot perform tasks.

## Model Specifications

LLM models can be specified simply as `&quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;`. However, you can use different models for chat, coding, and embeddings. 
You can pass a string or an object for these fields. A model object must specify an `api`, and optionally a `model`, `url`, and additional `params`.

```json
&quot;model&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;,
  &quot;params&quot;: {
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 1000,
    &quot;temperature&quot;: 1
  }
},
&quot;code_model&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;
},
&quot;vision_model&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;
},
&quot;embedding&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;text-embedding-ada-002&quot;
},
&quot;speak_model&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;tts-1&quot;,
  &quot;voice&quot;: &quot;echo&quot;
}

```

`model` is used for chat, `code_model` is used for newAction coding, `vision_model` is used for image interpretation, and `embedding` is used to embed text for example selection. If `code_model` or `vision_model` is not specified, `model` will be used by default. Not all APIs support embeddings or vision.

All apis have default models and urls, so those fields are optional. The `params` field is optional and can be used to specify additional parameters for the model. It accepts any key-value pairs supported by the api. Is not supported for embedding models.

## Embedding Models

Embedding models are used to embed and efficiently select relevant examples for conversation and coding.

Supported Embedding APIs: `openai`, `google`, `replicate`, `huggingface`, `novita`

If you try to use an unsupported model, then it will default to a simple word-overlap method. Expect reduced performance, recommend mixing APIs to ensure embedding support.

## Specifying Profiles via Command Line

By default, the program will use the profiles specified in `settings.js`. You can specify one or more agent profiles using the `--profiles` argument: `node main.js --profiles ./profiles/andy.json ./profiles/jill.json`

## Patches

Some of the node modules that we depend on have bugs in them. To add a patch, change your local node module file and run `npx patch-package [package-name]`

A modern rich text editor for Rails.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This is an early beta. It hasn&#039;t been battle-tested yet. Please try it out and report any issues you find.

## Features

- Built on top of [Lexical](https://lexical.dev), the powerful text editor framework from Meta.
- Good HTML semantics. Paragraphs are real `&lt;p&gt;` tags, as they should be.
- Markdown support: shortcuts, auto-formatting on paste.
- Real-time code syntax highlighting.
- Create links by pasting URLs on selected text.
- Configurable prompts. Support for mentions and other interactive prompts with multiple loading and filtering strategies.
- Preview attachments like PDFs and Videos in the editor.
- Works seamlessly with Action Text, generating the same canonical HTML format it expects for attachments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application&#039;s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem &#039;lexxy&#039;, &#039;~&gt; 0.1.23.beta&#039; # Need to specify the version since it&#039;s a pre-release
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

### With import maps

If you are using [propshaft](https://github.com/rails/propshaft) and [import maps](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails):

```ruby
# importmap.rb
pin &quot;lexxy&quot;, to: &quot;lexxy.js&quot;
pin &quot;@rails/activestorage&quot;, to: &quot;activestorage.esm.js&quot; # to support attachments
```

Then import it in your JavaScript entry point:

```javascript
// app/javascript/application.js
import &quot;lexxy&quot;
```

### With javascript bundlers

If you&#039;re using [jsbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails), esbuild, webpack, or any other JavaScript bundler, you can install the NPM package:

```bash
yarn add @37signals/lexxy
yarn add @rails/activestorage # to support attachments
```

Then import it in your JavaScript entry point:

```javascript
// app/javascript/application.js
import &quot;@37signals/lexxy&quot;
```

### Override Action Text defaults

By default, the gem overrides Action Text form helpers, so that if you use `form.rich_text_area`, it will render a Lexxy editor instead of the default Trix editor.

You can opt out of this behavior by disabling this option in `application.rb`:

```ruby# config/application.rb
config.lexxy.override_action_text_defaults = false
```

If you do this, you can invoke Lexxy explicitly using the same helpers with a `lexxy` preffix: `lexxy_rich_textarea_tag` and `form.lexxy_rich_text_area`.

This path is meant to let you incrementally move to Lexxy, or to use it in specific places while keeping Trix in others.

### CSS Setup

For the CSS, you can include it with the standard Rails helper:

```erb
&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &quot;lexxy&quot; %&gt;
```

You can copy the CSS to your project and adapt it to your needs.

#### Custom styles and dark mode

All of Lexxy&#039;s color styles are defiend as CSS variables in `app/stylesheets/lexxy-variables.css`. This enables a straightforward way to customize Lexxy to match your application&#039;s theme. You can see an example implementation of a custom dark mode style in the Sandbox&#039;s stylesheet at `test/dummy/app/assets/stylesheets/sandbox.css`.

#### Rendered Action Text content

For applying the same styles to rendered Action Text content, you need to override the current default by adding this template  `app/views/layouts/action_text/contents/_content.html.erb`:

```erb
&lt;div class=&quot;lexxy-content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;%= yield -%&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

To apply syntax highlighting to rendered Action Text content, you need to call the `highlightAll` function from Lexxy. For example, create a Stimulus controller in `app/javascript/controllers/syntax_highlight_controller.js`:

```javascript
import { Controller } from &quot;@hotwired/stimulus&quot;
import { highlightAll } from &quot;lexxy&quot;
// Or if you installed via a javascript bundler:
// import { highlightAll } from &quot;@37signals/lexxy&quot;

export default class extends Controller {
  connect() {
    highlightAll()
  }
}
```

Then update the Action Text Content template to include the `data-controller` attribute:

```erb
&lt;div data-controller=&quot;syntax-highlight&quot; class=&quot;lexxy-content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;%= yield -%&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

## Configuration

You can add a Lexxy instance using the regular Action Text form helper:

```erb
&lt;%= form_with model: @post do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;%= form.rich_text_area :content %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
```

Under the hood, this will insert a `&lt;lexxy-editor&gt;` tag, that will be a first-class form control:

```html
&lt;lexxy-editor name=&quot;post[body]&quot;...&gt;...&lt;/lexxy-editor&gt;
```

## Options

The `&lt;lexxy-editor&gt;` element supports these options:

- `placeholder`: Text displayed when the editor is empty.
- `toolbar`: Pass `&quot;false&quot;` to disable the toolbar entirely, or pass an element ID to render the toolbar in an external element. By default, the toolbar is bootstrapped and displayed above the editor.
- `attachments`: Pass `&quot;false&quot;` to disable attachments completely. By default, attachments are supported, including paste and Drag &amp; Drop support.

Lexxy uses the `ElementInternals` API to participate in HTML forms as any standard control. This means that you can use standard HTML attributes like `name`, `value`, `required`, `disabled`, etc.

## Prompts

Prompts let you implement features like @mentions, /commands, or any other trigger-based suggestions. When you select an item from the prompt, you have two options:

1. Insert the item as an [Action Text custom attachment](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html#signed-globalid). This allows you to use standard Action Text to customize how it renders or processes them on the server side.
2. Insert the item as free text in the editor.

Lexxy also lets you configure how to load the items: inline or remotely, and how to do the filtering (locally or on the server).

### General setup

The first thing to do is to add a `&lt;lexxy-prompt&gt;` element to the editor:

```erb
&lt;%= form.rich_text_area :body do %&gt;
  &lt;lexxy-prompt trigger=&quot;@&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/lexxy-prompt&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
```

The `trigger` option determines which key will open the prompt. A prompt can load its items from two sources:

- Inline, by defining the items inside the `&lt;lexxy-prompt&gt;` element.
- Remotely, by setting a `src` attribute with an endpoint to load the items.

Regardless of the source, the prompt items are defined using `&lt;lexxy-prompt-item&gt;` elements. A basic prompt item looks like this:

```html
&lt;lexxy-prompt-item search=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
  &lt;template type=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;...&lt;/template&gt;
  &lt;template type=&quot;editor&quot;&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/lexxy-prompt-item&gt;
```

Where:

* `search` contains the text to match against when filtering.
* `template[type= &quot;menu&quot;]` defines how the item appears in the dropdown menu.
* `template[type= &quot;editor&quot;]` defines how the item appears in the editor when selected.

### Custom attachments with inline loading

Imagine you want to implement a *mentions* feature, where users can type &quot;@&quot; and select a person to mention. You want to save mentions as action text attachments for further server-side processing when the form is submitted.

First, you need to include the `ActionText::Attachable` concern in your model, and you need to define the `#content_type` method to return a value like `application/vnd.actiontext.&lt;prompt name&gt;`, where `&lt;prompt name&gt;` is the value of the `name` attribute you will set in the `&lt;lexxy-prompt&gt;` element later. Let&#039;s use `mention` as the prompt name:

```ruby
# app/models/person.rb
class Person &lt; ApplicationRecord
  include ActionText::Attachable
  
  def content_type
    &quot;application/vnd.actiontext.mention&quot;
  end
end
```

By default, the partial to render the attachment will be looked up in `app/views/[model plural]/_[model singular].html.erb`. You can customize this by implementing `#to_attachable_partial_path` in the model. Let&#039;s go with the default and render a simple view that renders the person&#039;s name and initials:

```erb
# app/views/people/_person.html.erb
&lt;em&gt;&lt;%= person.name %&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;%= person.initials %&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)
```

On the editor side, let&#039;s start with the *inline* approach by rendering all the prompt items inside the `&lt;lexxy-prompt&gt;` element:

```erb
&lt;%= form.rich_text_area :body do %&gt;
  &lt;lexxy-prompt trigger=&quot;@&quot; name=&quot;mention&quot;&gt;
    &lt;%= render partial: &quot;people/prompt_item&quot;, collection: Person.all, as: :person %&gt;
  &lt;/lexxy-prompt&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
```

With `app/views/people/_prompt_item.html.erb` defining each prompt item:

```erb
&lt;lexxy-prompt-item search=&quot;&lt;%= &quot;#{person.name} #{person.initials}&quot; %&gt;&quot; sgid=&quot;&lt;%= person.attachable_sgid %&gt;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;template type=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;&lt;%= person.name %&gt;&lt;/template&gt;
  &lt;template type=&quot;editor&quot;&gt;
    &lt;%= render &quot;people/person&quot;, person: person %&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/lexxy-prompt-item&gt;
```

Notice how the template for rendering the editor representation (`type=&quot; editor&quot;) uses the same template as the attachment partial. This way, you ensure consistency between how the mention looks in the editor and how it will render when displaying the text in view mode with Action Text.

Two important additional notes to use action text with custom attachments:

* Each `&lt;lexxy-prompt-item&gt;` must include a `sgid` attribute with the [global id that Action Text will use to find the associated model](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html#signed-globalid).
* The `&lt;lexxy-prompt&gt;` must include a `name` attribute that will determine the content type of the attachment. For example, for `name= &quot;mention&quot;`, the attachment will be saved as `application/vnd.actiontext.mention`.

### Custom attachments with remote loading

For moderately large sets, you can configure Lexxy to load all the options from a remote endpoint once, and filter them locally as the user types. This is a good balance between performance and responsiveness.

Continuing with the mentions example, we could have a controller action that returns all people as prompt items, and configure it as the remote source via the `src` attribute:

```erb
&lt;lexxy-prompt trigger=&quot;@&quot; src=&quot;&lt;%= people_path %&gt;&quot; name=&quot;mention&quot;&gt;
&lt;/lexxy-prompt&gt;
```

We could define the controller action to serve the prompt items like this:

```ruby
class PeopleController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @people = Person.all

    render layout: false
  end
end
```

And the action would just list the prompt items:

```erb
&lt;%= render partial: &quot;people/prompt_item&quot;, collection: @people %&gt;
```

### Free HTML attachments

If you don&#039;t want to use custom action text attachments, you can configure prompts to simply insert the prompt item HTML directly in the editor. This is useful for things like hashtags, emojis, or other inline elements that don&#039;t require server-side processing.

To enable these, you must add the `insert-editable-text` attribute to the `&lt;lexxy-prompt&gt;` element:

```erb
&lt;lexxy-prompt trigger=&quot;@&quot; src=&quot;&lt;%= people_path %&gt;&quot; insert-editable-text&gt;
&lt;/lexxy-prompt&gt;
```

When configured like this,if you select an item from the prompt, the content of the `template[type= &quot;editor&quot;]` will be inserted directly in the editor as HTML you can edit freely, instead of as an `&lt;action-text-attachment&gt;` element. Notice that in this case, you need to make sure that the HTML is compatible with the tags that Lexxy supports.

### Remote filtering

There are scenarios where you want to query the server for filtering, instead of loading all options at once. This is useful for large datasets or complex searches. In this case, you must add the `remote-filtering` attribute to the `&lt;lexxy-prompt&gt;` element:

```erb
&lt;lexxy-prompt trigger=&quot;@&quot; src=&quot;&lt;%= people_path %&gt;&quot; name=&quot;mention&quot; remote-filtering&gt;
&lt;/lexxy-prompt&gt;
```

By default, the `SPACE` key will select the current item in the prompt. If you want to allow spaces in the search query, you can add the `supports-space-in-searches` attribute to the prompt. This can be handy to search by full names in combination with remote filtering.

### Prompt Options reference

#### `&lt;lexxy-prompt&gt;`

- `trigger`: The character that activates the prompt (e.g., &quot;@&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, &quot;/&quot;).
- `src`: Path or URL to load items remotely.
- `name`: Identifier for the prompt type (determines attachment content type, e.g., `name= &quot;mention&quot;` creates `application/vnd.actiontext.mention`). Mandatory unless using `insert-editable-text`.
- `empty-results`: Message shown when no matches found. By default it is &quot;Nothing found&quot;.
- `remote-filtering`: Enable server-side filtering instead of loading all options at once.
- `insert-editable-text`: Insert prompt item HTML directly as editable text instead of Action Text attachments.
- `supports-space-in-searches`: Allow spaces in search queries (useful with remote filtering for full name searches).

#### `&lt;lexxy-prompt-item&gt;`

- `search`: The text to match against when filtering (can include multiple fields for better search).
- `sgid`: The signed GlobalID for Action Text attachments (use `attachable_sgid` helper). Mandatory unless using `insert-editable-text`.

## Roadmap

This is an early beta. Here&#039;s what&#039;s coming next:

- Configurable editors in Action Text: Choose your editor like you choose your database.
- More editing features:
    - Tables
    - Text highlighting
- Image galleries: The only remaining feature for full Action Text compatibility
- Install task that generates the necessary JS and adds stylesheets.
- Configuration hooks.
- Standalone JS package: to use in non-Rails environments.

## Development

To build the JS source when it changes, run:

```bash
yarn build -w
```

To the sandbox app:

```bash
bin/rails server
```

The sandbox app is available at http://localhost:3000. There is also a CRUD example at http://localhost:3000/posts.

## Events

Lexxy fires a handful of custom events that you can hook into.
Each event is dispatched on the `&lt;lexxy-editor&gt;` element.

### `lexxy:initialize`

Fired when the `&lt;lexxy-editor&gt;` element is attached to the DOM and ready for use.
This is useful for one-time setup.

### lexxy:focus and lexxy:blur

Fired whenever the editor element gains or loses focus.
Useful to show or hide accessory UI state.

### `lexxy:change`

Fired whenever the editor content changes.
You can use this to sync the editor state with your application.

### `lexxy:file-accept`

Fired when a file is dropped or inserted into the editor.

- Access the file via `event.detail.file`.
- Call `event.preventDefault()` to cancel the upload and prevent attaching the file.

### `lexxy:insert-link`

Fired when a plain text link is pasted into the editor.
Access the link’s URL via `event.detail.url`.

You also get a handful of callback helpers on `event.detail`:

- **`replaceLinkWith(html, options)`** – replace the pasted link with your own HTML.
- **`insertBelowLink(html, options)`** – insert custom HTML below the link.
- **Attachment rendering** – pass `{ attachment: true }` in `options` to render as non-editable content,
  or `{ attachment: { sgid: &quot;your-sgid-here&quot; } }` to provide a custom SGID.

#### Example: Link Unfurling with Stimulus

When a user pastes a link, you may want to turn it into a preview or embed.
Here’s a Stimulus controller that sends the URL to your app, retrieves metadata,
and replaces the plain text link with a richer version:

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/link_unfurl_controller.js
import { Controller } from &quot;@hotwired/stimulus&quot;
import { post } from &quot;@rails/request.js&quot;

export default class extends Controller {
  static values = {
    url: String, // endpoint that handles unfurling
  }

  unfurl(event) {
    this.#unfurlLink(event.detail.url, event.detail)
  }

  async #unfurlLink(url, callbacks) {
    const { response } = await post(this.urlValue, {
      body: JSON.stringify({ url }),
      headers: {
        &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;,
        &quot;Accept&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;
      }
    })

    const metadata = await response.json()
    this.#insertUnfurledLink(metadata, callbacks)
  }

  #insertUnfurledLink(metadata, callbacks) {
    // Replace the pasted link with your custom HTML
    callbacks.replaceLinkWith(this.#renderUnfurledLinkHTML(metadata))

    // Or, insert below the link as an attachment:
    // callbacks.insertBelowLink(this.#renderUnfurledLinkHTML(metadata), { attachment: true })
  }

  #renderUnfurledLinkHTML(link) {
    return `&lt;a href=&quot;${link.canonical_url}&quot;&gt;${link.title}&lt;/a&gt;`
  }
}
```
