# GET SHIT DONE

**A light-weight and powerful meta-prompting, context engineering and spec-driven development system for Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Codex.**

**Solves context rot — the quality degradation that happens as Claude fills its context window.**

&lt;br&gt;

*&quot;If you know clearly what you want, this WILL build it for you. No bs.&quot;*

*&quot;I&#039;ve done SpecKit, OpenSpec and Taskmaster — this has produced the best results for me.&quot;*

*&quot;By far the most powerful addition to my Claude Code. Nothing over-engineered. Literally just gets shit done.&quot;*

&lt;br&gt;

**Trusted by engineers at Amazon, Google, Shopify, and Webflow.**

&lt;/div&gt;

## Why I Built This

I&#039;m a solo developer. I don&#039;t write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you&#039;re building. I&#039;m not a 50-person software company. I don&#039;t want to play enterprise theater. I&#039;m just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work *and* verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That&#039;s what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.

— **TÂCHES**

---

Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It&#039;s the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.

---

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they&#039;re running a 50-person engineering org.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

The installer prompts you to choose:
1. **Runtime** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, Codex, or all
2. **Location** — Global (all projects) or local (current project only)

Verify with:
- Claude Code / Gemini: `/gsd:help`
- OpenCode: `/gsd-help`
- Codex: `$gsd-help`

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Codex installation uses skills (`skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`) rather than custom prompts.

### Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# Claude Code
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --global   # Install to ~/.claude/
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local    # Install to ./.claude/

# OpenCode (open source, free models)
npx get-shit-done-cc --opencode --global # Install to ~/.config/opencode/

# Gemini CLI
npx get-shit-done-cc --gemini --global   # Install to ~/.gemini/

# Codex (skills-first)
npx get-shit-done-cc --codex --global    # Install to ~/.codex/
npx get-shit-done-cc --codex --local     # Install to ./.codex/

# All runtimes
npx get-shit-done-cc --all --global      # Install to all directories
```

Use `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the location prompt.
Use `--claude`, `--opencode`, `--gemini`, `--codex`, or `--all` to skip the runtime prompt.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Clone the repository and run the installer locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done.git
cd get-shit-done
node bin/install.js --claude --local
```

Installs to `./.claude/` for testing modifications before contributing.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Recommended: Skip Permissions Mode

GSD is designed for frictionless automation. Run Claude Code with:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; This is how GSD is intended to be used — stopping to approve `date` and `git commit` 50 times defeats the purpose.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative: Granular Permissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

If you prefer not to use that flag, add this to your project&#039;s `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allow&quot;: [
      &quot;Bash(date:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(echo:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(cat:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(ls:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(mkdir:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(wc:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(head:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(tail:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(sort:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(grep:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(tr:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git add:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git commit:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git status:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git log:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git diff:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git tag:*)&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## How It Works

&gt; **Already have code?** Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first. It spawns parallel agents to analyze your stack, architecture, conventions, and concerns. Then `/gsd:new-project` knows your codebase — questions focus on what you&#039;re adding, and planning automatically loads your patterns.

### 1. Initialize Project

```
/gsd:new-project
```

One command, one flow. The system:

1. **Questions** — Asks until it understands your idea completely (goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases)
2. **Research** — Spawns parallel agents to investigate the domain (optional but recommended)
3. **Requirements** — Extracts what&#039;s v1, v2, and out of scope
4. **Roadmap** — Creates phases mapped to requirements

You approve the roadmap. Now you&#039;re ready to build.

**Creates:** `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, `.planning/research/`

---

### 2. Discuss Phase

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 1
```

**This is where you shape the implementation.**

Your roadmap has a sentence or two per phase. That&#039;s not enough context to build something the way *you* imagine it. This step captures your preferences before anything gets researched or planned.

The system analyzes the phase and identifies gray areas based on what&#039;s being built:

- **Visual features** → Layout, density, interactions, empty states
- **APIs/CLIs** → Response format, flags, error handling, verbosity
- **Content systems** → Structure, tone, depth, flow
- **Organization tasks** → Grouping criteria, naming, duplicates, exceptions

For each area you select, it asks until you&#039;re satisfied. The output — `CONTEXT.md` — feeds directly into the next two steps:

1. **Researcher reads it** — Knows what patterns to investigate (&quot;user wants card layout&quot; → research card component libraries)
2. **Planner reads it** — Knows what decisions are locked (&quot;infinite scroll decided&quot; → plan includes scroll handling)

The deeper you go here, the more the system builds what you actually want. Skip it and you get reasonable defaults. Use it and you get *your* vision.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md`

---

### 3. Plan Phase

```
/gsd:plan-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Researches** — Investigates how to implement this phase, guided by your CONTEXT.md decisions
2. **Plans** — Creates 2-3 atomic task plans with XML structure
3. **Verifies** — Checks plans against requirements, loops until they pass

Each plan is small enough to execute in a fresh context window. No degradation, no &quot;I&#039;ll be more concise now.&quot;

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-RESEARCH.md`, `{phase_num}-{N}-PLAN.md`

---

### 4. Execute Phase

```
/gsd:execute-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Runs plans in waves** — Parallel where possible, sequential when dependent
2. **Fresh context per plan** — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage
3. **Commits per task** — Every task gets its own atomic commit
4. **Verifies against goals** — Checks the codebase delivers what the phase promised

Walk away, come back to completed work with clean git history.

**How Wave Execution Works:**

Plans are grouped into &quot;waves&quot; based on dependencies. Within each wave, plans run in parallel. Waves run sequentially.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE EXECUTION                                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                      │
│  WAVE 1 (parallel)          WAVE 2 (parallel)          WAVE 3       │
│  ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ │
│  │ Plan 01 │ │ Plan 02 │ →  │ Plan 03 │ │ Plan 04 │ →  │ Plan 05 │ │
│  │         │ │         │    │         │ │         │    │         │ │
│  │ User    │ │ Product │    │ Orders  │ │ Cart    │    │ Checkout│ │
│  │ Model   │ │ Model   │    │ API     │ │ API     │    │ UI      │ │
│  └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ │
│       │           │              ↑           ↑              ↑       │
│       └───────────┴──────────────┴───────────┘              │       │
│              Dependencies: Plan 03 needs Plan 01            │       │
│                          Plan 04 needs Plan 02              │       │
│                          Plan 05 needs Plans 03 + 04        │       │
│                                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why waves matter:**
- Independent plans → Same wave → Run in parallel
- Dependent plans → Later wave → Wait for dependencies
- File conflicts → Sequential plans or same plan

This is why &quot;vertical slices&quot; (Plan 01: User feature end-to-end) parallelize better than &quot;horizontal layers&quot; (Plan 01: All models, Plan 02: All APIs).

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-{N}-SUMMARY.md`, `{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md`

---

### 5. Verify Work

```
/gsd:verify-work 1
```

**This is where you confirm it actually works.**

Automated verification checks that code exists and tests pass. But does the feature *work* the way you expected? This is your chance to use it.

The system:

1. **Extracts testable deliverables** — What you should be able to do now
2. **Walks you through one at a time** — &quot;Can you log in with email?&quot; Yes/no, or describe what&#039;s wrong
3. **Diagnoses failures automatically** — Spawns debug agents to find root causes
4. **Creates verified fix plans** — Ready for immediate re-execution

If everything passes, you move on. If something&#039;s broken, you don&#039;t manually debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again with the fix plans it created.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-UAT.md`, fix plans if issues found

---

### 6. Repeat → Complete → Next Milestone

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 2
/gsd:plan-phase 2
/gsd:execute-phase 2
/gsd:verify-work 2
...
/gsd:complete-milestone
/gsd:new-milestone
```

Loop **discuss → plan → execute → verify** until milestone complete.

Each phase gets your input (discuss), proper research (plan), clean execution (execute), and human verification (verify). Context stays fresh. Quality stays high.

When all phases are done, `/gsd:complete-milestone` archives the milestone and tags the release.

Then `/gsd:new-milestone` starts the next version — same flow as `new-project` but for your existing codebase. You describe what you want to build next, the system researches the domain, you scope requirements, and it creates a fresh roadmap. Each milestone is a clean cycle: define → build → ship.

---

### Quick Mode

```
/gsd:quick
```

**For ad-hoc tasks that don&#039;t need full planning.**

Quick mode gives you GSD guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) with a faster path:

- **Same agents** — Planner + executor, same quality
- **Skips optional steps** — No research, no plan checker, no verifier
- **Separate tracking** — Lives in `.planning/quick/`, not phases

Use for: bug fixes, small features, config changes, one-off tasks.

```
/gsd:quick
&gt; What do you want to do? &quot;Add dark mode toggle to settings&quot;
```

**Creates:** `.planning/quick/001-add-dark-mode-toggle/PLAN.md`, `SUMMARY.md`

---

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

Claude Code is incredibly powerful *if* you give it the context it needs. Most people don&#039;t.

GSD handles it for you:

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded |
| `research/` | Ecosystem knowledge (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Scoped v1/v2 requirements with phase traceability |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you&#039;re going, what&#039;s done |
| `STATE.md` | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |
| `PLAN.md` | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps |
| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history |
| `todos/` | Captured ideas and tasks for later work |

Size limits based on where Claude&#039;s quality degrades. Stay under, get consistent excellence.

### XML Prompt Formatting

Every plan is structured XML optimized for Claude:

```xml
&lt;task type=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Create login endpoint&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;files&gt;src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts&lt;/files&gt;
  &lt;action&gt;
    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).
    Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  &lt;/action&gt;
  &lt;verify&gt;curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie&lt;/verify&gt;
  &lt;done&gt;Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401&lt;/done&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;
```

Precise instructions. No guessing. Verification built in.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Every stage uses the same pattern: a thin orchestrator spawns specialized agents, collects results, and routes to the next step.

| Stage | Orchestrator does | Agents do |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Research | Coordinates, presents findings | 4 parallel researchers investigate stack, features, architecture, pitfalls |
| Planning | Validates, manages iteration | Planner creates plans, checker verifies, loop until pass |
| Execution | Groups into waves, tracks progress | Executors implement in parallel, each with fresh 200k context |
| Verification | Presents results, routes next | Verifier checks codebase against goals, debuggers diagnose failures |

The orchestrator never does heavy lifting. It spawns agents, waits, integrates results.

**The result:** You can run an entire phase — deep research, multiple plans created and verified, thousands of lines of code written across parallel executors, automated verification against goals — and your main context window stays at 30-40%. The work happens in fresh subagent contexts. Your session stays fast and responsive.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

```bash
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing
lmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **Benefits:** Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task independently revertable. Clear history for Claude in future sessions. Better observability in AI-automated workflow.

Every commit is surgical, traceable, and meaningful.

### Modular by Design

- Add phases to current milestone
- Insert urgent work between phases
- Complete milestones and start fresh
- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything

You&#039;re never locked in. The system adapts.

### Claude Code

Claude Code only looks one level deep for `SKILL.md` files, so each skill folder must be directly under the skills directory. Clone the repo somewhere, then symlink individual skills:

```bash
# Clone to a convenient location
git clone https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills ~/pi-skills

# Symlink individual skills (user-level)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s ~/pi-skills/brave-search ~/.claude/skills/brave-search
ln -s ~/pi-skills/browser-tools ~/.claude/skills/browser-tools

  &lt;h1&gt;Cloud CLI (aka Claude Code UI)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


A desktop and mobile UI for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor CLI](https://docs.cursor.com/en/cli/overview) and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex). You can use it locally or remotely to view your active projects and sessions in Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex and make changes to them from everywhere (mobile or desktop). This gives you a proper interface that works everywhere.

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured, and/or
- [Cursor CLI](https://docs.cursor.com/en/cli/overview) installed and configured, and/or
- [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) installed and configured

### One-click Operation (Recommended)

No installation required, direct operation:

```bash
npx @siteboon/claude-code-ui
```

The server will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:3001` (or your configured PORT).

**To restart**: Simply run the same `npx` command again after stopping the server
### Global Installation (For Regular Use)

For frequent use, install globally once:

```bash
npm install -g @siteboon/claude-code-ui
```

Then start with a simple command:

```bash
claude-code-ui
```


**To restart**: Stop with Ctrl+C and run `claude-code-ui` again.

**To update**:
```bash
cloudcli update
```

### CLI Usage

After global installation, you have access to both `claude-code-ui` and `cloudcli` commands:

| Command / Option | Short | Description |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| `cloudcli` or `claude-code-ui` | | Start the server (default) |
| `cloudcli start` | | Start the server explicitly |
| `cloudcli status` | | Show configuration and data locations |
| `cloudcli update` | | Update to the latest version |
| `cloudcli help` | | Show help information |
| `cloudcli version` | | Show version information |
| `--port &lt;port&gt;` | `-p` | Set server port (default: 3001) |
| `--database-path &lt;path&gt;` | | Set custom database location |

**Examples:**
```bash
cloudcli                          # Start with defaults
cloudcli -p 8080              # Start on custom port
cloudcli status                   # Show current configuration
```

### Run as Background Service (Recommended for Production)

For production use, run Claude Code UI as a background service using PM2 (Process Manager 2):

#### Install PM2

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

#### Start as Background Service

```bash
# Start the server in background
pm2 start claude-code-ui --name &quot;claude-code-ui&quot;

# Or using the shorter alias
pm2 start cloudcli --name &quot;claude-code-ui&quot;

# Start on a custom port
pm2 start cloudcli --name &quot;claude-code-ui&quot; -- --port 8080
```


#### Auto-Start on System Boot

To make Claude Code UI start automatically when your system boots:

```bash
# Generate startup script for your platform
pm2 startup

# Save current process list
pm2 save
```


### Local Development Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siteboon/claudecodeui.git
cd claudecodeui
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your preferred settings
```

4. **Start the application:**
```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev

```
The application will start at the port you specified in your .env

5. **Open your browser:**
   - Development: `http://localhost:3001`

## Security &amp; Tools Configuration

**🔒 Important Notice**: All Claude Code tools are **disabled by default**. This prevents potentially harmful operations from running automatically.

### Enabling Tools

To use Claude Code&#039;s full functionality, you&#039;ll need to manually enable tools:

1. **Open Tools Settings** - Click the gear icon in the sidebar
3. **Enable Selectively** - Turn on only the tools you need
4. **Apply Settings** - Your preferences are saved locally

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

![Tools Settings Modal](public/screenshots/tools-modal.png)
*Tools Settings interface - enable only what you need*

&lt;/div&gt;

**Recommended approach**: Start with basic tools enabled and add more as needed. You can always adjust these settings later.

## TaskMaster AI Integration *(Optional)*

Claude Code UI supports **[TaskMaster AI](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)** (aka claude-task-master) integration for advanced project management and AI-powered task planning.

It provides
- AI-powered task generation from PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues &amp; Solutions


#### &quot;No Claude projects found&quot;
**Problem**: The UI shows no projects or empty project list
**Solutions**:
- Ensure [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is properly installed
- Run `claude` command in at least one project directory to initialize
- Verify `~/.claude/projects/` directory exists and has proper permissions

#### File Explorer Issues
**Problem**: Files not loading, permission errors, empty directories
**Solutions**:
- Check project directory permissions (`ls -la` in terminal)
- Verify the project path exists and is accessible
- Review server console logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure you&#039;re not trying to access system directories outside project scope

## Introduction

Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.

**TL;DR**

- Bundles [ES Modules](https://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](https://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).
- Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
- Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
- Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
- Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

#### Learn about webpack through videos!

- [Understanding Webpack - Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj93pvQIsRo)
- [Understanding Webpack - Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQiJaFzuJ8)

### Get Started

Check out webpack&#039;s quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

### Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
Webpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.

## Concepts

### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)

Webpack has a [rich plugin
interface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features
within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very
**flexible**.

### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)

Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle
**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own

&lt;/p&gt;

A full-stack application that enables you to turn any document, resource, or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as a reference during chatting. This application allows you to pick and choose which LLM or Vector Database you want to use as well as supporting multi-user management and permissions.

### Product Overview

AnythingLLM is a full-stack application where you can use commercial off-the-shelf LLMs or popular open source LLMs and vectorDB solutions to build a private ChatGPT with no compromises that you can run locally as well as host remotely and be able to chat intelligently with any documents you provide it.

AnythingLLM divides your documents into objects called `workspaces`. A Workspace functions a lot like a thread, but with the addition of containerization of your documents. Workspaces can share documents, but they do not talk to each other so you can keep your context for each workspace clean.

### Technical Overview

This monorepo consists of six main sections:

- `frontend`: A viteJS + React frontend that you can run to easily create and manage all your content the LLM can use.
- `server`: A NodeJS express server to handle all the interactions and do all the vectorDB management and LLM interactions.
- `collector`: NodeJS express server that processes and parses documents from the UI.
- `docker`: Docker instructions and build process + information for building from source.
- `embed`: Submodule for generation &amp; creation of the [web embed widget](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-embed).
- `browser-extension`: Submodule for the [chrome browser extension](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-extension).

## How to setup for development

- `yarn setup` To fill in the required `.env` files you&#039;ll need in each of the application sections (from root of repo).
  - Go fill those out before proceeding. Ensure `server/.env.development` is filled or else things won&#039;t work right.
- `yarn dev:server` To boot the server locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:frontend` To boot the frontend locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:collector` To then run the document collector (from root of repo).

## Telemetry &amp; Privacy

AnythingLLM by Mintplex Labs Inc contains a telemetry feature that collects anonymous usage information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;More about Telemetry &amp; Privacy for AnythingLLM&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

### Why?

We use this information to help us understand how AnythingLLM is used, to help us prioritize work on new features and bug fixes, and to help us improve AnythingLLM&#039;s performance and stability.

### Opting out

Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` in your server or docker .env settings to &quot;true&quot; to opt out of telemetry. You can also do this in-app by going to the sidebar &gt; `Privacy` and disabling telemetry.

### What do you explicitly track?

We will only track usage details that help us make product and roadmap decisions, specifically:

- Type of your installation (Docker or Desktop)

- When a document is added or removed. No information _about_ the document. Just that the event occurred. This gives us an idea of use.

- Type of vector database in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider.

- Type of LLM provider &amp; model tag in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider or model, or combination thereof. eg: reasoning vs regular, multi-modal models, etc.

- When a chat is sent. This is the most regular &quot;event&quot; and gives us an idea of the daily-activity of this project across all installations. Again, only the **event** is sent - we have no information on the nature or content of the chat itself.

You can verify these claims by finding all locations `Telemetry.sendTelemetry` is called. Additionally these events are written to the output log so you can also see the specific data which was sent - if enabled. **No IP or other identifying information is collected**. The Telemetry provider is [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) - an open-source telemetry collection service.

We take privacy very seriously, and we hope you understand that we want to learn how our tool is used, without using annoying popup surveys, so we can build something worth using. The anonymous data is _never_ shared with third parties, ever.

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.

## Contributing

PDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors. To

Feel free to stop by our [Matrix room](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#pdfjs:mozilla.org) for questions or guidance.

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the &quot;Modern browsers&quot; version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools &gt; Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.

For an introduction to the PDF.js code, check out the presentation by our
contributor Julian Viereck:

# Development build
pnpm dev

# Production build
pnpm build

# Local preview
pnpm serve
```

## How it Works

### The Gemini Watermarking Process

Gemini applies watermarks using standard alpha compositing:

$$watermarked = \alpha \cdot logo + (1 - \alpha) \cdot original$$

Where:
- `watermarked`: The pixel value with the watermark.
- `α`: The Alpha channel value (0.0 - 1.0).
- `logo`: The watermark logo color value (White = 255).
- `original`: The raw, original pixel value we want to recover.

### The Reverse Solution

To remove the watermark, we solve for `original`:

$$original = \frac{watermarked - \alpha \cdot logo}{1 - \alpha}$$

By capturing the watermark on a known solid background, we reconstruct the exact Alpha map and apply the inverse formula to restore the original pixels with zero loss.

## Detection Rules

| Image Dimension Condition | Watermark Size | Right Margin | Bottom Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Width &gt; 1024 **AND** Height &gt; 1024 | 96×96 | 64px | 64px |
| Otherwise | 48×48 | 32px | 32px |

## Core Modules

### alphaMap.js

Calculates the Alpha channel by comparing captured watermark assets:

```javascript
export function calculateAlphaMap(bgCaptureImageData) {
    // Extract max RGB channel and normalize to [0, 1]
    const alphaMap = new Float32Array(width * height);
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; alphaMap.length; i++) {
        const maxChannel = Math.max(r, g, b);
        alphaMap[i] = maxChannel / 255.0;
    }
    return alphaMap;
}
```

### blendModes.js

The mathematical core of the tool:

```javascript
export function removeWatermark(imageData, alphaMap, position) {
    // Formula: original = (watermarked - α × 255) / (1 - α)
    for (let row = 0; row &lt; height; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col &lt; width; col++) {
            const alpha = Math.min(alphaMap[idx], MAX_ALPHA);
            const original = (watermarked - alpha * 255) / (1.0 - alpha);
            imageData.data[idx] = Math.max(0, Math.min(255, original));
        }
    }
}
```
