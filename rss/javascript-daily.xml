![Screenshot of the Gutenberg Editor, editing a post in WordPress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1204802/100067796-fc3e8700-2e36-11eb-993b-6b80b4310b87.png)

Welcome to the development hub for the WordPress Gutenberg project!

&quot;Gutenberg&quot; is a codename for a whole new paradigm in WordPress site building and publishing, that aims to revolutionize the entire publishing experience as much as Gutenberg did the printed word. Right now, the project is in the second phase of a four-phase process that will touch every piece of WordPress -- Editing, Customization, **Collaboration** (which includes [Real-time collaboration](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/03/real-time-collaboration/), [Asynchronous collaboration](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/04/workflows/), [Publishing flows](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/04/workflows/), [Post revisions interface](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/), [Admin design](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/), [Library](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/10/block-library/)), and Multilingual -- and is focused on a new editing experience, the block editor.

The block editor introduces a modular approach to pages and posts: each piece of content in the editor, from a paragraph to an image gallery to a headline, is its own block. And just like physical blocks, WordPress blocks can be added, arranged, and rearranged, allowing WordPress users to create media-rich pages in a visually intuitive way -- and without work-arounds like shortcodes or custom HTML.

The block editor first became available in December 2018, and we&#039;re still hard at work refining the experience, creating more and better blocks, and laying the groundwork for the next three phases of work. The Gutenberg plugin gives you the latest version of the block editor, so you can join us in testing bleeding-edge features, start playing with blocks, and maybe get inspired to build your own.

Check out the [Keeping up with Gutenberg Index](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/)

## Getting Started

Get hands on: check out the [block editor live demo](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) to play with a test instance of the editor.

### Using Gutenberg

-   **Download:** To use the latest release of the Gutenberg plugin on your WordPress site: install from the plugins page in wp-admin, or [download from the WordPress.org plugins repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/).

-   **User Documentation:** See the [WordPress Editor documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-block-editor/) for detailed docs on using the editor as an author creating posts and pages.

-   **User Support:** If you have run into an issue, you should check the [Support Forums first](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/). The forums are a great place to get help. If you have a bug to report, please [submit it to the Gutenberg repository](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues). Please search prior to creating a new bug to confirm it&#039;s not a duplicate.

### Developing for Gutenberg

Extending and customizing is at the heart of the WordPress platform, this is no different for the Gutenberg project. The editor and future products can be extended by third-party developers using plugins.

Review the [Quick Start Guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/) for the fastest way to get started extending the block editor. See the [Block Editor Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/) for extensive tutorials, documentation, and API references. Also, check the [WordPress Developer Blog](https://developer.wordpress.org/blog/) for great articles about block development, among other topics.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Odin Project Curriculum

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. Our curriculum is divided into distinct courses, each covering the subject language in depth. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give users the opportunity to practice what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed projects may then be included in the user&#039;s portfolio.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repo contains the actual lesson files used on our website. For the actual TOP app that pulls in this lesson content and contains our front-end and back-end code, please go to the [main TOP repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).

Our community can be found on the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB).

## Contributing

We welcome contributors of all experience levels and backgrounds to help maintain this awesome curriculum and community. If you would like to contribute to our curriculum, be sure to thoroughly read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Some of the things you can do to contribute to our curriculum include:

- Correct typos and other grammar errors.
- Rewrite parts of existing lessons to make them clearer and easier to understand.
- Fix broken links.
- Add new resource links you think would make a lesson better.

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Rollup&lt;/h1&gt;

## Overview

Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the standardized ES module format for code, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. ES modules let you freely and seamlessly combine the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. Rollup can optimize ES modules for faster native loading in modern browsers, or output a legacy module format allowing ES module workflows today.

## Quick Start Guide

Install with `npm install --global rollup`. Rollup can be used either through a [command line interface](https://rollupjs.org/command-line-interface/) with an optional configuration file or else through its [JavaScript API](https://rollupjs.org/javascript-api/). Run `rollup --help` to see the available options and parameters. The starter project templates, [rollup-starter-lib](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-lib) and [rollup-starter-app](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-app), demonstrate common configuration options, and more detailed instructions are available throughout the [user guide](https://rollupjs.org/introduction/).

### Commands

These commands assume the entry point to your application is named main.js, and that you&#039;d like all imports compiled into a single file named bundle.js.

For browsers:

```bash
# compile to a &lt;script&gt; containing a self-executing function
rollup main.js --format iife --name &quot;myBundle&quot; --file bundle.js
```

For Node.js:

```bash
# compile to a CommonJS module
rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js
```

For both browsers and Node.js:

```bash
# UMD format requires a bundle name
rollup main.js --format umd --name &quot;myBundle&quot; --file bundle.js
```

## Why

Developing software is usually easier if you break your project into smaller separate pieces, since that often removes unexpected interactions and dramatically reduces the complexity of the problems you&#039;ll need to solve, and simply writing smaller projects in the first place [isn&#039;t necessarily the answer](https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/small-modules-it-s-not-quite-that-simple-3ca532d65de4). Unfortunately, JavaScript has not historically included this capability as a core feature in the language.

This finally changed with ES modules support in JavaScript, which provides a syntax for importing and exporting functions and data so they can be shared between separate scripts. Most browsers and Node.js support ES modules. However, Node.js releases before 12.17 support ES modules only behind the `--experimental-modules` flag, and older browsers like Internet Explorer do not support ES modules at all. Rollup allows you to write your code using ES modules, and run your application even in environments that do not support ES modules natively. For environments that support them, Rollup can output optimized ES modules; for environments that don&#039;t, Rollup can compile your code to other formats such as CommonJS modules, AMD modules, and IIFE-style scripts. This means that you get to _write future-proof code_, and you also get the tremendous benefits of...

## Tree Shaking

In addition to enabling the use of ES modules, Rollup also statically analyzes and optimizes the code you are importing, and will exclude anything that isn&#039;t actually used. This allows you to build on top of existing tools and modules without adding extra dependencies or bloating the size of your project.

For example, with CommonJS, the _entire tool or library must be imported_.

```js
// import the entire utils object with CommonJS
var utils = require(&#039;node:utils&#039;);
var query = &#039;Rollup&#039;;
// use the ajax method of the utils object
utils.ajax(&#039;https://api.example.com?search=&#039; + query).then(handleResponse);
```

But with ES modules, instead of importing the whole `utils` object, we can just import the one `ajax` function we need:

```js
// import the ajax function with an ES import statement
import { ajax } from &#039;node:utils&#039;;

var query = &#039;Rollup&#039;;
// call the ajax function
ajax(&#039;https://api.example.com?search=&#039; + query).then(handleResponse);
```

Because Rollup includes the bare minimum, it results in lighter, faster, and less complicated libraries and applications. Since this approach is based on explicit `import` and `export` statements, it is vastly more effective than simply running an automated minifier to detect unused variables in the compiled output code.

## Compatibility

### Importing CommonJS

Rollup can import existing CommonJS modules [through a plugin](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs).

### Publishing ES Modules

To make sure your ES modules are immediately usable by tools that work with CommonJS such as Node.js and webpack, you can use Rollup to compile to UMD or CommonJS format, and then point to that compiled version with the `main` property in your `package.json` file. If your `package.json` file also has a `module` field, ES-module-aware tools like Rollup and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) will [import the ES module version](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module) directly.

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the &quot;Modern browsers&quot; version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools &gt; Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.

# 插件系统

&lt;/div&gt;

软件内置接口数量有限，但是您可以通过插件系统来扩展软件的功能。

## 插件安装

你可以在 [Plugin List](https://pot-app.com/plugin.html) 查找你需要的插件，然后前往插件仓库下载插件。

pot 插件的扩展名为 `.potext`, 下载得到`.potext`文件之后， 在 偏好设置-服务设置-添加外部插件-安装外部插件 选择对应的 `.potext` 即可安装成功，添加到服务列表中即可像内置服务一样正常使用了。

### 故障排除

-   找不到指定的模块 (Windows)

    出现类似这样的报错是因为系统缺少 C++库，前往[这里](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022)安装即可解决问题。

-   不是有效的 Win32 应用程序 (Windows)

    出现类似这样的报错说明你没有下载对应系统或者架构的插件，前往插件仓库下载正确的插件即可解决问题。

## 插件开发

在 [Plugin List](https://pot-app.com/plugin.html) 中的 [模板](https://pot-app.com/plugin.html#%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF) 章节提供了各种插件的开发模板，具体的开发文档请查看对应的模板仓库。

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

# 安装指南

&lt;/div&gt;

## Windows

### 通过 Winget 安装

```powershell
winget install Pylogmon.pot
```

### 手动安装

1. 在 [Release](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/releases/latest) 页面下载最新 `exe` 安装包。

    - 64 位机器下载 `pot_{version}_x64-setup.exe`
    - 32 位机器下载 `pot_{version}_x86-setup.exe`
    - arm64 机器下载 `pot_{version}_arm64-setup.exe`

2. 双击安装包进行安装。

### 故障排除

-   启动后没有界面，点击托盘图标没有反应

    检查是否卸载/禁用了 WebView2，如果卸载/禁用了 WebView2，请手动安装 WebView2 或将其恢复。

    如果是企业版系统不方便安装或无法安装 WebView2，请尝试在 [Release](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/releases/latest) 下载内置 WebView2 的版本 `pot_{version}_{arch}_fix_webview2_runtime-setup.exe`

    若问题仍然存在请尝试使用 Windows7 兼容模式启动。

## MacOS

### 通过 Brew 安装

1. 添加我们的 tap:

```bash
brew tap pot-app/homebrew-tap
```

2. 安装 pot:

```bash
brew install --cask pot
```

3. 更新 pot

```bash
brew upgrade --cask pot
```

### 手动安装

1. 从 [Release](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/releases/latest) 页面下载最新的 `dmg` 安装包。（如果您使用的是 M1 芯片，请下载名为`pot_{version}_aarch64.dmg`的安装包，否则请下载名为`pot_{version}_x64.dmg`的安装包）
2. 双击下载的文件后将 pot 拖入 Applications 文件夹即可完成安装。

### 故障排除

-   由于开发者无法验证，“pot”无法打开。

    点击 取消 按钮，然后去 设置 -&gt; 隐私与安全性 页面，点击 仍要打开 按钮，然后在弹出窗口里点击 打开 按钮即可，以后打开 pot 就再也不会有任何弹窗告警了

    如果在 隐私与安全性 中找不到以上选项，或启动时提示文件损坏。打开 Terminal.app，并输入以下命令，然后重启 pot 即可：

    ```bash
    sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/pot.app
    ```

-   如果每次打开时都遇到辅助功能权限提示，或者无法进行划词翻译，请前往设置 -&gt; 隐私与安全 -&gt; 辅助功能，移除 “pot”，并重新添加 “pot”。

## Linux

### Debian/Ubuntu

1. 从 [Release](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/releases/latest) 页面下载最新的对应架构的 `deb` 安装包。

2. 使用 `apt-get` 进行安装

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ./pot_{version}_amd64.deb
    ```

### Arch/Manjaro

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; 在最新版本的 [Webkit2Gtk](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/webkit2gtk) (2.42.0) 中，由于 Nvidia 专有驱动未完全实现 DMABUF，将导致无法启动和崩溃的情况发生。&lt;br&gt;
&gt; 请降级或在 `/etc/environment` （或者其他设置环境变量的地方）中加入 `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` 环境变量关闭 DMABUF 的使用。

1. 在 [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&amp;K=pot-translation) 查看

使用 `AUR helper` 安装：

```bash
yay -S pot-translation # 或 pot-translation-bin

# paru -S pot-translation # 或 pot-translation-bin
```

2. 如果你使用 `archlinuxcn` 源，可以直接使用 pacman 安装

```bash
sudo pacman -S pot-translation
```

### Flatpak

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Flatpak 版本缺失托盘图标。

&lt;a href=&#039;https://flathub.org/apps/com.pot_app.pot&#039;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&#039;240&#039; alt=&#039;Download on Flathub&#039; src=&#039;https://flathub.org/api/badge?locale=zh-Hans&#039;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

# 外部调用

&lt;/div&gt;

Pot 提供了完整的 HTTP 接口，以便可以被其他软件调用。您可以通过向 `127.0.0.1:port` 发送 HTTP 请求来调用 pot，其中的`port`是 pot 监听的端口号，默认为`60828`,可以在软件设置中进行更改。

## API 文档:

```bash
POST &quot;/&quot; =&gt; 翻译指定文本(body为需要翻译的文本),
GET &quot;/config&quot; =&gt; 打开设置,
POST &quot;/translate&quot; =&gt; 翻译指定文本(同&quot;/&quot;),
GET &quot;/selection_translate&quot; =&gt; 划词翻译,
GET &quot;/input_translate&quot; =&gt; 输入翻译,
GET &quot;/ocr_recognize&quot; =&gt; 截图OCR,
GET &quot;/ocr_translate&quot; =&gt; 截图翻译,
GET &quot;/ocr_recognize?screenshot=false&quot; =&gt; 截图OCR(不使用软件内截图),
GET &quot;/ocr_translate?screenshot=false&quot; =&gt; 截图翻译(不使用软件内截图),
GET &quot;/ocr_recognize?screenshot=true&quot; =&gt; 截图OCR,
GET &quot;/ocr_translate?screenshot=true&quot; =&gt; 截图翻译,
```

## 示例：

-   调用划词翻译：

    如果想要调用 pot 划词翻译，只需向`127.0.0.1:port`发送请求即可。

    例如通过 curl 发送请求：

    ```bash
    curl &quot;127.0.0.1:60828/selection_translate&quot;
    ```

## 不使用软件内截图

这一功能可以让您在不使用软件内截图的情况下调用截图 OCR/截图翻译功能，这样您就可以使用您喜欢的截图工具来截图了，也可以解决在某些平台下 pot 自带的截图无法使用的问题。

### 调用流程

1. 使用其他截图工具截图
2. 将截图保存在 `$CACHE/com.pot-app.desktop/pot_screenshot_cut.png`
3. 向`127.0.0.1:port/ocr_recognize?screenshot=false`发送请求即可调用成功

&gt; `$CACHE`为系统缓存目录，例如在 Windows 上为`C:\Users\{用户名}\AppData\Local\com.pot-app.desktop\pot_screenshot_cut.png`

### 示例

在 Linux 下调用 Flameshot 进行截图 OCR:

```bash
rm ~/.cache/com.pot-app.desktop/pot_screenshot_cut.png &amp;&amp; flameshot gui -s -p ~/.cache/com.pot-app.desktop/pot_screenshot_cut.png &amp;&amp; curl &quot;127.0.0.1:60828/ocr_recognize?screenshot=false&quot;
```

## 现有用法 (快捷划词翻译)

### SnipDo (Windows)

1. 从 [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/snipdo/9NPZ2TVKJVT7) 下载安装 SnipDo。
2. 从 [Release](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/releases/latest) 下载 pot 的 SnipDo 扩展 (pot.pbar)
3. 双击下载的扩展文件完成安装。
4. 选中文字，可以看到弹出的 SnipDo 工具条，点击翻译按钮即可翻译。

### PopClip (MacOS)

1. 从 [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/popclip/id445189367?mt=12) 下载安装 PopClip
2. 从 [Release](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/releases/latest) 下载 pot 的 PopClip 扩展 (pot.popclipextz)
3. 双击下载的扩展文件完成安装。
4. 在 PopClip 的扩展中启用 pot 扩展，选中文本即可点击翻译。

### Starry (Linux)

&gt; Starry 目前仍处于开发阶段，因此您只能手动编译它。

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

# Wayland 支持

&lt;/div&gt;

由于各大发行版对于 Wayland 的支持程度不同，所以 pot 本身没法做到特别完美的支持，这里可以提供一些常见问题的解决方案，通过合理的设置之后，pot 也可以在 Wayland 下完美运行。

## 快捷键无法使用

由于 Tauri 的快捷键方案并没有支持 Wayland，所以 pot 应用内的快捷键设置在 Wayland 下无法使用。 您可以设置系统快捷用 curl 发送请求来触发 pot，详见[外部调用](#外部调用)

## 截图无法使用

在一些纯 Wayland 桌面环境/窗口管理器(如 Hyprland)上，pot 内置的截图无法使用，这时可以通过使用其他截图工具代替，详见 [不使用软件内截图](#不使用软件内截图)

下面给出在 Hyprland 下的配置示例(通过 grim 和 slurp 实现截图)：

```conf
bind = ALT, X, exec, grim -g &quot;$(slurp)&quot; ~/.cache/com.pot-app.desktop/pot_screenshot_cut.png &amp;&amp; curl &quot;127.0.0.1:60828/ocr_recognize?screenshot=false&quot;
bind = ALT, C, exec, grim -g &quot;$(slurp)&quot; ~/.cache/com.pot-app.desktop/pot_screenshot_cut.png &amp;&amp; curl &quot;127.0.0.1:60828/ocr_translate?screenshot=false&quot;
```

其他桌面环境/窗口管理器也是类似的操作

## 划词翻译窗口跟随鼠标位置

由于目前 pot 在 Wayland 下还无法获取到正确的鼠标坐标，所以内部的实现无法工作。 对于某些桌面环境/窗口管理器，可以通过设置窗口规则来实现窗口跟随鼠标位置，这里以 Hyprland 为例：

```conf
windowrulev2 = float, class:(pot), title:(Translator|OCR|PopClip|Screenshot Translate) # Translation window floating
windowrulev2 = move cursor 0 0, class:(pot), title:(Translator|PopClip|Screenshot Translate) # Translation window follows the mouse position.
```

+ Use an existing Remote CDM like [this one](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19639399/remote.json)
+ Follow [this](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/408031) guide if you want to dump your own device.
+ Ready-to-use Widevine Devices can be found on the [VideoHelp forum](https://forum.videohelp.com/forums/48).

## Compatibility
+ Compatible (tested) browsers: Firefox/Chrome on Windows/Linux.
+ Works with any service that accepts challenges from Android devices on the same endpoint.

## Installation
+ Chrome
  1. Download the ZIP file from the [releases section](https://github.com/DevLARLEY/WidevineProxy2/releases)
  2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
  3. Enable `Developer mode`
  4. Drag-and-drop the downloaded file into the window
+ Firefox
  + Persistent installation
    1. Download the XPI file from the [releases section](https://github.com/DevLARLEY/WidevineProxy2/releases)
    2. Navigate to `about:addons`
    3. Click the settings icon and choose `Install Add-on From File...`
    4. Select the downloaded file
  + Temporary installation
    1. Download the ZIP file from the [releases section](https://github.com/DevLARLEY/WidevineProxy2/releases)
    2. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
    3. Click `Load Temporary Add-on...` and select the downloaded file

## Setup
### Widevine Device
If you only have a `device_client_id_blob` and `device_private_key`, run this command to create a .wvd file:
```
pywidevine create-device -k device_private_key -c device_client_id_blob -t &quot;ANDROID&quot; -l 3
```
Now, open the extension, click `Choose File` and select your Widevine Device file.

### Remote CDM
If you don&#039;t already have a `remote.json` file, open the API URL in the browser (if provided) and save the response as `remote.json`. \
Now, open the extension, click `Choose remote.json` and select the JSON file provided by your API.


+ Select the type of device you&#039;re using in the top right-hand corner
+ The files are saved in the extension&#039;s `chrome.storage.sync` storage and will be synchronized across any browsers into which the user is signed in with their Google account.
+ The maximum number of Widevine devices is ~25 **OR** ~200 Remote CDMs
+ Check `Enabled` to activate the message interception and you&#039;re done.

## Usage
All the user has to do is to play a DRM protected video and the decryption keys should appear in the `Keys` group box (if the service is not unsupported, as stated above). \
Keys are saved:
+ Temporarily until the extension is either refreshed manually (if installed temporarily) or a removal of the keys is manually initiated.
+ Permanently in the extension&#039;s `chrome.storage.local` storage until manually wiped or exported via the command line.
&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; The video will not play when the interception is active, as the Widevine CDM library isn&#039;t able to decrypt the Android CDM license.

+ Click the `+` button to expand the section to reveal the PSSH and keys.

## FAQ
&gt; What if I&#039;m unable to get the keys?

This automatically means that the license server is blocking your CDM and that you either need a CDM from a physical device, a ChromeCDM, or an L1 Android CDM. Don&#039;t ask where you can get these

## Issues
+ DRM playback won&#039;t work when the extension is disabled and EME Logger is active. This is caused by my fix for dealing with EME Logger interference (solutions are welcome).

&gt; Play around with [our MCP Server on MCP.so&#039;s playground](https://mcp.so/playground?server=firecrawl-mcp-server) or on [Klavis AI](https://www.klavis.ai/mcp-servers).

## Installation

### Running with npx

```bash
env FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-YOUR_API_KEY npx -y firecrawl-mcp
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
npm install -g firecrawl-mcp
```

### Running on Cursor

Configuring Cursor 🖥️
Note: Requires Cursor version 0.45.6+
For the most up-to-date configuration instructions, please refer to the official Cursor documentation on configuring MCP servers:
[Cursor MCP Server Configuration Guide](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers)

To configure Firecrawl MCP in Cursor **v0.48.6**

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to Features &gt; MCP Servers
3. Click &quot;+ Add new global MCP server&quot;
4. Enter the following code:
   ```json
   {
     &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
       &quot;firecrawl-mcp&quot;: {
         &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
         &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;firecrawl-mcp&quot;],
         &quot;env&quot;: {
           &quot;FIRECRAWL_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR-API-KEY&quot;
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
To configure Firecrawl MCP in Cursor **v0.45.6**

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to Features &gt; MCP Servers
3. Click &quot;+ Add New MCP Server&quot;
4. Enter the following:
   - Name: &quot;firecrawl-mcp&quot; (or your preferred name)
   - Type: &quot;command&quot;
   - Command: `env FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key npx -y firecrawl-mcp`



&gt; If you are using Windows and are running into issues, try `cmd /c &quot;set FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key &amp;&amp; npx -y firecrawl-mcp&quot;`

Replace `your-api-key` with your Firecrawl API key. If you don&#039;t have one yet, you can create an account and get it from https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys

After adding, refresh the MCP server list to see the new tools. The Composer Agent will automatically use Firecrawl MCP when appropriate, but you can explicitly request it by describing your web scraping needs. Access the Composer via Command+L (Mac), select &quot;Agent&quot; next to the submit button, and enter your query.

### Running on Windsurf

Add this to your `./codeium/windsurf/model_config.json`:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;mcp-server-firecrawl&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;firecrawl-mcp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;FIRECRAWL_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Running with SSE Local Mode

To run the server using Server-Sent Events (SSE) locally instead of the default stdio transport:

```bash
env SSE_LOCAL=true FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-YOUR_API_KEY npx -y firecrawl-mcp
```

Use the url: http://localhost:3000/sse

### Installing via Smithery (Legacy)

To install Firecrawl for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@mendableai/mcp-server-firecrawl):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @mendableai/mcp-server-firecrawl --client claude
```

### Running on VS Code

For one-click installation, click one of the install buttons below...

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

```json
{
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;inputs&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;apiKey&quot;,
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Firecrawl API Key&quot;,
        &quot;password&quot;: true
      }
    ],
    &quot;servers&quot;: {
      &quot;firecrawl&quot;: {
        &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;firecrawl-mcp&quot;],
        &quot;env&quot;: {
          &quot;FIRECRAWL_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;${input:apiKey}&quot;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others:

```json
{
  &quot;inputs&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;apiKey&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Firecrawl API Key&quot;,
      &quot;password&quot;: true
    }
  ],
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;firecrawl&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;firecrawl-mcp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;FIRECRAWL_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;${input:apiKey}&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Required for Cloud API

- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: Your Firecrawl API key
  - Required when using cloud API (default)
  - Optional when using self-hosted instance with `FIRECRAWL_API_URL`
- `FIRECRAWL_API_URL` (Optional): Custom API endpoint for self-hosted instances
  - Example: `https://firecrawl.your-domain.com`
  - If not provided, the cloud API will be used (requires API key)

#### Optional Configuration

##### Retry Configuration

- `FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
- `FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY`: Initial delay in milliseconds before first retry (default: 1000)
- `FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY`: Maximum delay in milliseconds between retries (default: 10000)

- `FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD`: Credit usage critical threshold (default: 100)

### Configuration Examples

For cloud API usage with custom retry and credit monitoring:

```bash
# Required for cloud API
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Optional retry configuration
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5        # Increase max retry attempts
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY=2000    # Start with 2s delay
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY=30000       # Maximum 30s delay
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR=3      # More aggressive backoff

```bash
# Required for self-hosted
export FIRECRAWL_API_URL=https://firecrawl.your-domain.com

# Optional authentication for self-hosted
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key  # If your instance requires auth

# Custom retry configuration
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=10
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY=500     # Start with faster retries
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;mcp-server-firecrawl&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;firecrawl-mcp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;FIRECRAWL_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&quot;,

        &quot;FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS&quot;: &quot;5&quot;,
        &quot;FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY&quot;: &quot;2000&quot;,
        &quot;FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY&quot;: &quot;30000&quot;,
        &quot;FIRECRAWL_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR&quot;: &quot;3&quot;,

        &quot;FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_WARNING_THRESHOLD&quot;: &quot;2000&quot;,
        &quot;FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD&quot;: &quot;500&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### System Configuration

The server includes several configurable parameters that can be set via environment variables. Here are the default values if not configured:

```typescript
const CONFIG = {
  retry: {
    maxAttempts: 3, // Number of retry attempts for rate-limited requests
    initialDelay: 1000, // Initial delay before first retry (in milliseconds)
    maxDelay: 10000, // Maximum delay between retries (in milliseconds)
    backoffFactor: 2, // Multiplier for exponential backoff
  },
  credit: {
    warningThreshold: 1000, // Warn when credit usage reaches this level
    criticalThreshold: 100, // Critical alert when credit usage reaches this level
  },
};
```

These configurations control:

1. **Retry Behavior**

   - Automatically retries failed requests due to rate limits
   - Uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
   - Example: With default settings, retries will be attempted at:
     - 1st retry: 1 second delay
     - 2nd retry: 2 seconds delay
     - 3rd retry: 4 seconds delay (capped at maxDelay)

2. **Credit Usage Monitoring**
   - Tracks API credit consumption for cloud API usage
   - Provides warnings at specified thresholds
   - Helps prevent unexpected service interruption
   - Example: With default settings:
     - Warning at 1000 credits remaining
     - Critical alert at 100 credits remaining

### Rate Limiting and Batch Processing

The server utilizes Firecrawl&#039;s built-in rate limiting and batch processing capabilities:

- Automatic rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- Efficient parallel processing for batch operations
- Smart request queuing and throttling
- Automatic retries for transient errors

## Available Tools

### 1. Scrape Tool (`firecrawl_scrape`)

Scrape content from a single URL with advanced options.

**Best for:**
- Single page content extraction, when you know exactly which page contains the information.

**Not recommended for:**
- Extracting content from multiple pages (use batch_scrape for known URLs, or map + batch_scrape to discover URLs first, or crawl for full page content)
- When you&#039;re unsure which page contains the information (use search)
- When you need structured data (use extract)

**Common mistakes:**
- Using scrape for a list of URLs (use batch_scrape instead).

**Prompt Example:**
&gt; &quot;Get the content of the page at https://example.com.&quot;

**Usage Example:**
```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firecrawl_scrape&quot;,
  &quot;arguments&quot;: {
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com&quot;,
    &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;],
    &quot;onlyMainContent&quot;: true,
    &quot;waitFor&quot;: 1000,
    &quot;timeout&quot;: 30000,
    &quot;mobile&quot;: false,
    &quot;includeTags&quot;: [&quot;article&quot;, &quot;main&quot;],
    &quot;excludeTags&quot;: [&quot;nav&quot;, &quot;footer&quot;],
    &quot;skipTlsVerification&quot;: false
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
- Markdown, HTML, or other formats as specified.

### 2. Batch Scrape Tool (`firecrawl_batch_scrape`)

Scrape multiple URLs efficiently with built-in rate limiting and parallel processing.

**Best for:**
- Retrieving content from multiple pages, when you know exactly which pages to scrape.

**Not recommended for:**
- Discovering URLs (use map first if you don&#039;t know the URLs)
- Scraping a single page (use scrape)

**Common mistakes:**
- Using batch_scrape with too many URLs at once (may hit rate limits or token overflow)

**Prompt Example:**
&gt; &quot;Get the content of these three blog posts: [url1, url2, url3].&quot;

**Usage Example:**
```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firecrawl_batch_scrape&quot;,
  &quot;arguments&quot;: {
    &quot;urls&quot;: [&quot;https://example1.com&quot;, &quot;https://example2.com&quot;],
    &quot;options&quot;: {
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;],
      &quot;onlyMainContent&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
- Response includes operation ID for status checking:

```json
{
  &quot;content&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Batch operation queued with ID: batch_1. Use firecrawl_check_batch_status to check progress.&quot;
    }
  ],
  &quot;isError&quot;: false
}
```

### 3. Check Batch Status (`firecrawl_check_batch_status`)

Check the status of a batch operation.

```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firecrawl_check_batch_status&quot;,
  &quot;arguments&quot;: {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;batch_1&quot;
  }
}
```

### 4. Map Tool (`firecrawl_map`)

Map a website to discover all indexed URLs on the site.

**Best for:**
- Discovering URLs on a website before deciding what to scrape
- Finding specific sections of a website

**Not recommended for:**
- When you already know which specific URL you need (use scrape or batch_scrape)
- When you need the content of the pages (use scrape after mapping)

**Common mistakes:**
- Using crawl to discover URLs instead of map

**Prompt Example:**
&gt; &quot;List all URLs on example.com.&quot;

**Usage Example:**
```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firecrawl_map&quot;,
  &quot;arguments&quot;: {
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com&quot;
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
- Array of URLs found on the site

### 5. Search Tool (`firecrawl_search`)

Search the web and optionally extract content from search results.

**Best for:**
- Finding specific information across multiple websites, when you don&#039;t know which website has the information.
- When you need the most relevant content for a query

**Not recommended for:**
- When you already know which website to scrape (use scrape)
- When you need comprehensive coverage of a single website (use map or crawl)

**Common mistakes:**
- Using crawl or map for open-ended questions (use search instead)

**Usage Example:**
```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firecrawl_search&quot;,
  &quot;arguments&quot;: {
    &quot;query&quot;: &quot;latest AI research papers 2023&quot;,
    &quot;limit&quot;: 5,
    &quot;lang&quot;: &quot;en&quot;,
    &quot;country&quot;: &quot;us&quot;,
    &quot;scrapeOptions&quot;: {
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;],
      &quot;onlyMainContent&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
- Array of search results (with optional scraped content)

**Prompt Example:**
&gt; &quot;Find the latest research papers on AI published in 2023.&quot;

### 6. Crawl Tool (`firecrawl_crawl`)

Starts an asynchronous crawl job on a website and extract content from all pages.

**Best for:**
- Extracting content from multiple related pages, when you need comprehensive coverage.

**Not recommended for:**
- Extracting content from a single page (use scrape)
- When token limits are a concern (use map + batch_scrape)
- When you need fast results (crawling can be slow)

**Warning:** Crawl responses can be very large and may exceed token limits. Limit the crawl depth and number of pages, or use map + batch_scrape for better control.

**Common mistakes:**
- Setting limit or maxDepth too high (causes token overflow)
- Using crawl for a single page (use scrape instead)

**Prompt Example:**
&gt; &quot;Get all blog posts from the first two levels of example.com/blog.&quot;

**Usage Example:**
```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firecrawl_crawl&quot;,
  &quot;arguments&quot;: {
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/blog/*&quot;,
    &quot;maxDepth&quot;: 2,
    &quot;limit&quot;: 100,
    &quot;allowExternalLinks&quot;: false,
    &quot;deduplicateSimilarURLs&quot;: true
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
- Response includes operation ID for status checking:

```json
{
  &quot;content&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Started crawl for: https://example.com/* with job ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000. Use firecrawl_check_crawl_status to check progress.&quot;
    }
  ],
  &quot;isError&quot;: false
}
```

### 7. Check Crawl Status (`firecrawl_check_crawl_status`)

Check the status of a crawl job.

```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firecrawl_check_crawl_status&quot;,
  &quot;arguments&quot;: {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000&quot;
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
- Response includes the status of the crawl job:
  
### 8. Extract Tool (`firecrawl_extract`)

Extract structured information from web pages using LLM capabilities. Supports both cloud AI and self-hosted LLM extraction.

**Best for:**
- Extracting specific structured data like prices, names, details.

**Not recommended for:**
- When you need the full content of a page (use scrape)
- When you&#039;re not looking for specific structured data

**Arguments:**
- `urls`: Array of URLs to extract information from
- `prompt`: Custom prompt for the LLM extraction
- `systemPrompt`: System prompt to guide the LLM
- `schema`: JSON schema for structured data extraction
- `allowExternalLinks`: Allow extraction from external links
- `enableWebSearch`: Enable web search for additional context
- `includeSubdomains`: Include subdomains in extraction

When using a self-hosted instance, the extraction will use your configured LLM. For cloud API, it uses Firecrawl&#039;s managed LLM service.
**Prompt Example:**
&gt; &quot;Extract the product name, price, and description from these product pages.&quot;

**Usage Example:**
```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firecrawl_extract&quot;,
  &quot;arguments&quot;: {
    &quot;urls&quot;: [&quot;https://example.com/page1&quot;, &quot;https://example.com/page2&quot;],
    &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract product information including name, price, and description&quot;,
    &quot;systemPrompt&quot;: &quot;You are a helpful assistant that extracts product information&quot;,
    &quot;schema&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
      &quot;properties&quot;: {
        &quot;name&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot; },
        &quot;price&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot; },
        &quot;description&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot; }
      },
      &quot;required&quot;: [&quot;name&quot;, &quot;price&quot;]
    },
    &quot;allowExternalLinks&quot;: false,
    &quot;enableWebSearch&quot;: false,
    &quot;includeSubdomains&quot;: false
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
- Extracted structured data as defined by your schema

```json
{
  &quot;content&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Example Product&quot;,
        &quot;price&quot;: 99.99,
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is an example product description&quot;
      }
    }
  ],
  &quot;isError&quot;: false
}
```

### 9. Deep Research Tool (`firecrawl_deep_research`)

Conduct deep web research on a query using intelligent crawling, search, and LLM analysis.

**Best for:**
- Complex research questions requiring multiple sources, in-depth analysis.

**Not recommended for:**
- Simple questions that can be answered with a single search
- When you need very specific information from a known page (use scrape)
- When you need results quickly (deep research can take time)

**Arguments:**
- query (string, required): The research question or topic to explore.
- maxDepth (number, optional): Maximum recursive depth for crawling/search (default: 3).
- timeLimit (number, optional): Time limit in seconds for the research session (default: 120).
- maxUrls (number, optional): Maximum number of URLs to analyze (default: 50).

**Prompt Example:**
&gt; &quot;Research the environmental impact of electric vehicles versus gasoline vehicles.&quot;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.

**TL;DR**

- Bundles [ES Modules](https://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).
- Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
- Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
- Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
- Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

#### Learn about webpack through videos!

### Get Started

Check out webpack&#039;s quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

### Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
Webpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.

&lt;h2&gt;Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)

Webpack has a [rich plugin
interface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features
within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very
**flexible**.

### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)

Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle
**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own
loaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.

Loaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,
or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.
