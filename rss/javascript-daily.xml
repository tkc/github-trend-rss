Documentation is still available but it&#039;s moved to
[https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0) and
[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

## What is Label Studio?

&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

## Try out Label Studio

Install Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. Also you can try [Label Studio Teams](https://app.heartex.com).

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python &gt;=3.7 &lt;=3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you&#039;ve made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you&#039;re using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you&#039;re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

#### Run test suite
```bash
pip install -r deploy/requirements-test.txt
cd label_studio

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass)
DJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto
```


## What you get from Label Studio

![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it&#039;s tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/templates-categories.jpg&quot; /&gt;

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

## Demos

You can try Plyr in Codepen using our minimal templates: [HTML5 video](https://codepen.io/pen?template=bKeqpr), [HTML5 audio](https://codepen.io/pen?template=rKLywR), [YouTube](https://codepen.io/pen?template=GGqbbJ), [Vimeo](https://codepen.io/pen?template=bKeXNq). For Streaming we also have example integrations with: [Dash.js](https://codepen.io/pen?template=GRoogML), [Hls.js](https://codepen.io/pen?template=oyLKQb) and [Shaka Player](https://codepen.io/pen?template=ZRpzZO)

# Quick setup

## HTML

Plyr extends upon the standard [HTML5 media element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) markup so that&#039;s all you need for those types.

### HTML5 Video

```html
&lt;video id=&quot;player&quot; playsinline controls data-poster=&quot;/path/to/poster.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/video.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/video.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;!-- Captions are optional --&gt;
  &lt;track kind=&quot;captions&quot; label=&quot;English captions&quot; src=&quot;/path/to/captions.vtt&quot; srclang=&quot;en&quot; default /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
```

**Note**: The poster image should be specified using `data-poster`. This is to prevent it [being downloaded twice](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1531). If you&#039;re sure the image will be cached, you can still use the `poster` attribute for true progressive enhancement.

### HTML5 Audio

```html
&lt;audio id=&quot;player&quot; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/audio.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mp3&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/audio.ogg&quot; type=&quot;audio/ogg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
```

For YouTube and Vimeo players, Plyr uses progressive enhancement to enhance the default `&lt;iframe&gt;` embeds. Below are some examples. The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the embed responsive. You can add the `autoplay`, `loop`, `hl` (YouTube only) and `playsinline` (YouTube only) query parameters to the URL and they will be set as config options automatically. For YouTube, the `origin` should be updated to reflect the domain you&#039;re hosting the embed on, or you can opt to omit it.

### YouTube

We recommend [progressive enhancement](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) with the embedded players. You can elect to use an `&lt;iframe&gt;` as the source element (which Plyr will progressively enhance) or a bog standard `&lt;div&gt;` with two essential data attributes - `data-plyr-provider` and `data-plyr-embed-id`.

```html
&lt;div class=&quot;plyr__video-embed&quot; id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe
    src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTqVqk7FSmY?origin=https://plyr.io&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;playsinline=1&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot;
    allowfullscreen
    allowtransparency
    allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

_Note_: The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the player a responsive 16:9 (most common) iframe embed. When plyr itself kicks in, your custom `ratio` config option will be used.

Or the `&lt;div&gt;` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot; data-plyr-provider=&quot;youtube&quot; data-plyr-embed-id=&quot;bTqVqk7FSmY&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

_Note_: The `data-plyr-embed-id` can either be the video ID or URL for the media.

### Vimeo

Much the same as YouTube above.

```html
&lt;div class=&quot;plyr__video-embed&quot; id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe
    src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?loop=false&amp;amp;byline=false&amp;amp;portrait=false&amp;amp;title=false&amp;amp;speed=true&amp;amp;transparent=0&amp;amp;gesture=media&quot;
    allowfullscreen
    allowtransparency
    allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

Or the `&lt;div&gt;` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot; data-plyr-provider=&quot;vimeo&quot; data-plyr-embed-id=&quot;76979871&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

## JavaScript

You can use Plyr as an ES6 module as follows:

```js
import Plyr from &#039;plyr&#039;;

const player = new Plyr(&#039;#player&#039;);
```

Alternatively you can include the `plyr.js` script before the closing `&lt;/body&gt;` tag and then in your JS create a new instance of Plyr as below.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/plyr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const player = new Plyr(&#039;#player&#039;);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

See [initialising](#initializing) for more information on advanced setups.

You can use our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) for the JavaScript. There&#039;s 2 versions; one with and one without [polyfills](#polyfills). My recommendation would be to manage polyfills separately as part of your application but to make life easier you can use the polyfilled build.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

...or...

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.polyfilled.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## CSS

Include the `plyr.css` stylesheet into your `&lt;head&gt;`.

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;path/to/plyr.css&quot; /&gt;
```

If you want to use our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) for the default CSS, you can use the following:

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.css&quot; /&gt;
```

## SVG Sprite

The SVG sprite is loaded automatically from our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)). To change this, see the [options](#options) below. For
reference, the CDN hosted SVG sprite can be found at `https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.svg`.

### Self hosting

If you don&#039;t want to create a build system to include Plyr as an npm module, you can use the pre-built files. You have a few options:

- Download the files from the CDN links above, they&#039;re already minified.
- Download the files from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/plyr/dist/) or similar services.
- Build the project yourself using `npm i &amp;&amp; npm run build`, which installs the dependencies and spits out a build to `dist`.

# Ads

Plyr has partnered up with [vi.ai](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio) to offer monetization options for your videos. Getting setup is easy:

- [Sign up for a vi.ai account](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio)
- Grab your publisher ID from the code snippet
- Enable ads in the [config options](#options) and enter your publisher ID

Any questions regarding the ads can be sent straight to vi.ai and any issues with rendering raised through GitHub issues.

If you do not wish to use Vi, you can set your own `ads.tagUrl` [option](#options).

# Advanced

## Customizing the CSS

If you want to change any design tokens used for the rendering of the player, you can do so using [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

Here&#039;s a list of the properties and what they are used for:

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; ℹ️ **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected
&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

&gt; Imagine you are an experienced Ethereum developer tasked with creating a smart
&gt; contract for a blockchain messenger. The objective is to save messages on the
&gt; blockchain, making them readable (public) to everyone, writable (private) only
&gt; to the person who deployed the contract, and to count how many times the
&gt; message was updated. Develop a Solidity smart contract for this purpose,
&gt; including the necessary functions and considerations for achieving the

            <h2>README</h2><pre>About
----- 

**drawio-desktop** is a diagramming desktop app based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that wraps the [core draw.io editor](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).

Download built binaries from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).

**Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don&#039;t change the code and accept it is provided &quot;as-is&quot;, you can use it for any purpose.

Security
--------

draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.

No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. There is a Content Security Policy in place on the web part of the interface to ensure external transmission cannot happen, even by accident.

Security and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no.

Support
-------

Support is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support for non-paying users.

Purchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop.

Developing
----------

**draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.git`

To run this:
1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo)
2. [internal use only] export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode.
3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`.

Note: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also.

To release:
1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin.
2. Wait for the builds to complete (https://travis-ci.org/jgraph/drawio-desktop and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidjgraph/drawio-desktop)
3. Go to https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases, edit the preview release.
4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr http://rfc3161timestamp.globalsign.com/advanced /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe`
5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe`
6. Add release notes
7. Publish release

*Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them.

Local Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io`
- Windows: `C:\Users\&lt;USER-NAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\draw.io\`

Not open-contribution
---------------------

draw.io is closed to contributions (unless a maintainer permits it, which is extremely rare).

The level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes 
can break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required 
is far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we&#039;d have 
to basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented.

We are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, &amp; feature requests. We do
not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we&#039;ve
made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for 
the long term viability of the project.

## About
**A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app**

The library works by launching the WhatsApp Web browser application and managing it using Puppeteer to create an instance of WhatsApp Web, thereby mitigating the risk of being blocked. The WhatsApp API client connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app, accessing its internal functions. This grants you access to nearly all the features available on WhatsApp Web, enabling dynamic handling similar to any other Node.js application.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn&#039;t be considered totally safe.**

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.

## Contributing

PDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors. To
get involved, visit:

Feel free to stop by our [Matrix room](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#pdfjs:mozilla.org) for questions or guidance.

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the &quot;Modern browsers&quot; version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools &gt; Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.

For an introduction to the PDF.js code, check out the presentation by our
contributor Julian Viereck:

- Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a **WebSocket**. 
- Not running Selenium or Chromium saves you like **half a gig** of ram :/ 
- Baileys supports interacting with the multi-device &amp; web versions of WhatsApp.
- Thank you to [@pokearaujo](https://github.com/pokearaujo/multidevice) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Multi-Device. Also, thank you to [@Sigalor](https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Web and thanks to [@Rhymen](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/) for the __go__ implementation.

## Connecting Account

WhatsApp provides a multi-device API that allows Baileys to be authenticated as a second WhatsApp client by scanning a **QR code** or **Pairing Code** with WhatsApp on your phone.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **[Here](#example-to-start) is a simple example of event handling**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **You can see all supported socket configs [here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/SocketConfig.html) (Recommended)**

### Starting socket with **QR-CODE**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can customize browser name if you connect with **QR-CODE**, with `Browser` constant, we have some browsers config, **see [here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/BrowsersMap.html)**

```ts
import makeWASocket from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    browser: Browsers.ubuntu(&#039;My App&#039;),
    printQRInTerminal: true
})
```

If the connection is successful, you will see a QR code printed on your terminal screen, scan it with WhatsApp on your phone and you&#039;ll be logged in!

### Starting socket with **Pairing Code**


&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Pairing Code isn&#039;t Mobile API, it&#039;s a method to connect Whatsapp Web without QR-CODE, you can connect only with one device, see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1324084875126592/?cms_platform=web)

The phone number can&#039;t have `+` or `()` or `-`, only numbers, you must provide country code

```ts
import makeWASocket from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    printQRInTerminal: false //need to be false
})

if (!sock.authState.creds.registered) {
    const number = &#039;XXXXXXXXXXX&#039;
    const code = await sock.requestPairingCode(number)
    console.log(code)
}
```

### Receive Full History

1. Set `syncFullHistory` as `true`
2. Baileys, by default, use chrome browser config
    - If you&#039;d like to emulate a desktop connection (and receive more message history), this browser setting to your Socket config:

```ts
const sock = makeWASocket({
    ...otherOpts,
    // can use Windows, Ubuntu here too
    browser: Browsers.macOS(&#039;Desktop&#039;),
    syncFullHistory: true
})
```

## Important Notes About Socket Config

### Caching Group Metadata (Recommended)
- If you use baileys for groups, we recommend you to set `cachedGroupMetadata` in socket config, you need to implement a cache like this:

    ```ts
    const groupCache = new NodeCache({stdTTL: 5 * 60, useClones: false})

    const sock = makeWASocket({
        cachedGroupMetadata: async (jid) =&gt; groupCache.get(jid)
    })

    sock.ev.on(&#039;groups.update&#039;, async ([event]) =&gt; {
        const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
        groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
    })

    sock.ev.on(&#039;group-participants.update&#039;, async (event) =&gt; {
        const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
        groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
    })
    ```

### Improve Retry System &amp; Decrypt Poll Votes
- If you want to improve sending message, retrying when error occurs and decrypt poll votes, you need to have a store and set `getMessage` config in socket like this:
    ```ts
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        getMessage: async (key) =&gt; await getMessageFromStore(key)
    })
    ```

### Receive Notifications in Whatsapp App
- If you want to receive notifications in whatsapp app, set `markOnlineOnConnect` to `false`
    ```ts
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        markOnlineOnConnect: false
    })
    ```
## Saving &amp; Restoring Sessions

You obviously don&#039;t want to keep scanning the QR code every time you want to connect. 

So, you can load the credentials to log back in:
```ts
import makeWASocket, { useMultiFileAuthState } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState(&#039;auth_info_baileys&#039;)

// will use the given state to connect
// so if valid credentials are available -- it&#039;ll connect without QR
const sock = makeWASocket({ auth: state })

// this will be called as soon as the credentials are updated
sock.ev.on(&#039;creds.update&#039;, saveCreds)
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; `useMultiFileAuthState` is a utility function to help save the auth state in a single folder, this function serves as a good guide to help write auth &amp; key states for SQL/no-SQL databases, which I would recommend in any production grade system.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; When a message is received/sent, due to signal sessions needing updating, the auth keys (`authState.keys`) will update. Whenever that happens, you must save the updated keys (`authState.keys.set()` is called). Not doing so will prevent your messages from reaching the recipient &amp; cause other unexpected consequences. The `useMultiFileAuthState` function automatically takes care of that, but for any other serious implementation -- you will need to be very careful with the key state management.

## Handling Events

- Baileys uses the EventEmitter syntax for events. 
They&#039;re all nicely typed up, so you shouldn&#039;t have any issues with an Intellisense editor like VS Code.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **The events are [these](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/BaileysEventMap.html)**, it&#039;s important you see all events

You can listen to these events like this:
```ts
const sock = makeWASocket()
sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.upsert&#039;, ({ messages }) =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;got messages&#039;, messages)
})
```

### Example to Start

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This example includes basic auth storage too

```ts
import makeWASocket, { DisconnectReason, useMultiFileAuthState } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;
import { Boom } from &#039;@hapi/boom&#039;

async function connectToWhatsApp () {
    const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState(&#039;auth_info_baileys&#039;)
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        // can provide additional config here
        auth: state,
        printQRInTerminal: true
    })
    sock.ev.on(&#039;connection.update&#039;, (update) =&gt; {
        const { connection, lastDisconnect } = update
        if(connection === &#039;close&#039;) {
            const shouldReconnect = (lastDisconnect.error as Boom)?.output?.statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut
            console.log(&#039;connection closed due to &#039;, lastDisconnect.error, &#039;, reconnecting &#039;, shouldReconnect)
            // reconnect if not logged out
            if(shouldReconnect) {
                connectToWhatsApp()
            }
        } else if(connection === &#039;open&#039;) {
            console.log(&#039;opened connection&#039;)
        }
    })
    sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.upsert&#039;, event =&gt; {
        for (const m of event.messages) {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(m, undefined, 2))

            console.log(&#039;replying to&#039;, m.key.remoteJid)
            await sock.sendMessage(m.key.remoteJid!, { text: &#039;Hello Word&#039; })
        }
    })

    // to storage creds (session info) when it updates
    sock.ev.on(&#039;creds.update&#039;, saveCreds)
}
// run in main file
connectToWhatsApp()
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; In `messages.upsert` it&#039;s recommended to use a loop like `for (const message of event.messages)` to handle all messages in array

### Decrypt Poll Votes

- By default poll votes are encrypted and handled in `messages.update`
- That&#039;s a simple example
```ts
sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.update&#039;, event =&gt; {
    for(const { key, update } of event) {
        if(update.pollUpdates) {
            const pollCreation = await getMessage(key)
            if(pollCreation) {
                console.log(
                    &#039;got poll update, aggregation: &#039;,
                    getAggregateVotesInPollMessage({
                        message: pollCreation,
                        pollUpdates: update.pollUpdates,
                    })
                )
            }
        }
    }
})
```

- `getMessage` is a [store](#implementing-a-data-store) implementation (in your end)

### Summary of Events on First Connection

1. When you connect first time, `connection.update` will be fired requesting you to restart sock
2. Then, history messages will be received in `messaging.history-set`

## Implementing a Data Store

- Baileys does not come with a defacto storage for chats, contacts, or messages. However, a simple in-memory implementation has been provided. The store listens for chat updates, new messages, message updates, etc., to always have an up-to-date version of the data.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; I highly recommend building your own data store, as storing someone&#039;s entire chat history in memory is a terrible waste of RAM.

It can be used as follows:

```ts
import makeWASocket, { makeInMemoryStore } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;
// the store maintains the data of the WA connection in memory
// can be written out to a file &amp; read from it
const store = makeInMemoryStore({ })
// can be read from a file
store.readFromFile(&#039;./baileys_store.json&#039;)
// saves the state to a file every 10s
setInterval(() =&gt; {
    store.writeToFile(&#039;./baileys_store.json&#039;)
}, 10_000)

const sock = makeWASocket({ })
// will listen from this socket
// the store can listen from a new socket once the current socket outlives its lifetime
store.bind(sock.ev)

sock.ev.on(&#039;chats.upsert&#039;, () =&gt; {
    // can use &#039;store.chats&#039; however you want, even after the socket dies out
    // &#039;chats&#039; =&gt; a KeyedDB instance
    console.log(&#039;got chats&#039;, store.chats.all())
})

sock.ev.on(&#039;contacts.upsert&#039;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;got contacts&#039;, Object.values(store.contacts))
})

```

The store also provides some simple functions such as `loadMessages` that utilize the store to speed up data retrieval.

## Whatsapp IDs Explain

- `id` is the WhatsApp ID, called `jid` too, of the person or group you&#039;re sending the message to. 
    - It must be in the format ```[country code][phone number]@s.whatsapp.net```
	    - Example for people: ```+19999999999@s.whatsapp.net```. 
	    - For groups, it must be in the format ``` 123456789-123345@g.us ```. 
    - For broadcast lists, it&#039;s `[timestamp of creation]@broadcast`.
    - For stories, the ID is `status@broadcast`.

## Utility Functions

- `getContentType`, returns the content type for any message
- `getDevice`, returns the device from message
- `makeCacheableSignalKeyStore`, make auth store more fast
- `downloadContentFromMessage`, download content from any message

## Sending Messages

- Send all types of messages with a single function
    - **[Here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/AnyMessageContent.html) you can see all message contents supported, like text message**
    - **[Here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/MiscMessageGenerationOptions.html) you can see all options supported, like quote message**

    ```ts
    const jid: string
    const content: AnyMessageContent
    const options: MiscMessageGenerationOptions

    sock.sendMessage(jid, content, options)
    ```

### Non-Media Messages

#### Text Message
```ts
await sock.sendMessage(jid, { text: &#039;hello word&#039; })
```

#### Quote Message (works with all types)
```ts
await sock.sendMessage(jid, { text: &#039;hello word&#039; }, { quoted: message })
```

#### Mention User

# Prebid.js

&gt; A free and open source library for publishers to quickly implement header bidding.

This README is for developers who want to contribute to Prebid.js.
Additional documentation can be found at [the Prebid.js documentation homepage](https://docs.prebid.org/prebid/prebidjs.html).
Working examples can be found in [the developer docs](https://prebid.org/dev-docs/getting-started.html).

Prebid.js is open source software that is offered for free as a convenience. While it is designed to help companies address legal requirements associated with header bidding, we cannot and do not warrant that your use of Prebid.js will satisfy legal requirements. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of Prebid.js complies with all applicable laws.  We strongly encourage you to obtain legal advice when using Prebid.js to ensure your implementation complies with all laws where you operate.

&lt;a name=&quot;Usage&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Usage (as a npm dependency)

**Note**: versions prior to v10 required some Babel plugins to be configured when used as an NPM dependency -
refer to [v9 README](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/9.43.0/README.md).

```javascript
import pbjs from &#039;prebid.js&#039;;
import &#039;prebid.js/modules/rubiconBidAdapter&#039;; // imported modules will register themselves automatically with prebid
import &#039;prebid.js/modules/appnexusBidAdapter&#039;;
pbjs.processQueue();  // required to process existing pbjs.queue blocks and setup any further pbjs.queue execution

pbjs.requestBids({
  ...
})
```

You can import just type definitions for every module from `types.d.ts`, and for the `pbjs` global from `global.d.ts`:

```typescript
import &#039;prebid.js/types.d.ts&#039;;
import &#039;prebid.js/global.d.ts&#039;;
pbjs.que.push(/* ... */)
```

Or, if your Prebid bundle uses a different global variable name:

```typescript
import type {PrebidJS} from &#039;prebid.js/types.d.ts&#039;;
declare global {
    interface Window {
        myCustomPrebidGlobal: PrebidJS;
    }
}
```

&lt;a name=&quot;Install&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Install



    $ git clone https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js.git
    $ cd Prebid.js
    $ npm ci

*Note:* You need to have `NodeJS` 12.16.1 or greater installed.

*Note:* In the 1.24.0 release of Prebid.js we have transitioned to using gulp 4.0 from using gulp 3.9.1.  To comply with gulp&#039;s recommended setup for 4.0, you&#039;ll need to have `gulp-cli` installed globally prior to running the general `npm ci`.  This shouldn&#039;t impact any other projects you may work on that use an earlier version of gulp in its setup.

If you have a previous version of `gulp` installed globally, you&#039;ll need to remove it before installing `gulp-cli`.  You can check if this is installed by running `gulp -v` and seeing the version that&#039;s listed in the `CLI` field of the output.  If you have the `gulp` package installed globally, it&#039;s likely the same version that you&#039;ll see in the `Local` field.  If you already have `gulp-cli` installed, it should be a lower major version (it&#039;s at version `2.0.1` at the time of the transition).

To remove the old package, you can use the command: `npm rm gulp -g`

Once setup, run the following command to globally install the `gulp-cli` package: `npm install gulp-cli -g`


&lt;a name=&quot;Build&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Build for Development

To build the project on your local machine we recommend, running:

    $ gulp serve-and-test --file &lt;spec_file.js&gt;

This will run testing but not linting. A web server will start at `http://localhost:9999` serving from the project root and generates the following files:

+ `./build/dev/prebid.js` - Full source code for dev and debug
+ `./build/dev/prebid.js.map` - Source map for dev and debug
+ `./build/dev/prebid-core.js`
+ `./build/dev/prebid-core.js.map`


Development may be a bit slower but if you prefer linting and additional watch files you can also still run just:

    $ gulp serve


### Build Optimization

The standard build output contains all the available modules from within the `modules` folder.  Note, however that there are bid adapters which support multiple bidders through aliases, so if you don&#039;t see a file in modules for a bid adapter, you may need to grep the repository to find the name of the module you need to include.

You might want to exclude some/most of them from the final bundle.  To make sure the build only includes the modules you want, you can specify the modules to be included with the `--modules` CLI argument.

For example, when running the serve command: `gulp serve --modules=openxBidAdapter,rubiconBidAdapter,sovrnBidAdapter`

Building with just these adapters will result in a smaller bundle which should allow your pages to load faster.

**Build standalone prebid.js**

- Clone the repo, run `npm ci`
- Then run the build:

        $ gulp build --modules=openxBidAdapter,rubiconBidAdapter,sovrnBidAdapter

Alternatively, a `.json` file can be specified that contains a list of modules you would like to include.

    $ gulp build --modules=modules.json

With `modules.json` containing the following
```json modules.json
[
  &quot;openxBidAdapter&quot;,
  &quot;rubiconBidAdapter&quot;,
  &quot;sovrnBidAdapter&quot;
]
```

**Build prebid.js using npm for bundling**

In case you&#039;d like to explicitly show that your project uses `prebid.js` and want a reproducible build, consider adding it as an `npm` dependency.

- Add `prebid.js` as a `npm` dependency of your project: `npm install prebid.js`
- Run the `prebid.js` build under the `node_modules/prebid.js/` folder

        $ gulp build --modules=path/to/your/list-of-modules.json

Most likely your custom `prebid.js` will only change when there&#039;s:

- A change in your list of modules
- A new release of `prebid.js`

Having said that, you are probably safe to check your custom bundle into your project.  You can also generate it in your build process.

**Build once, bundle multiple times**

If you need to generate multiple distinct bundles from the same Prebid version, you can reuse a single build with:

```
gulp build
gulp bundle --tag one --modules=one.json
gulp bundle --tag two --modules=two.json
```

This generates slightly larger files, but has the advantage of being much faster to run (after the initial `gulp build`). It&#039;s also the method used by [the Prebid.org download page](https://docs.prebid.org/download.html).

&lt;a name=&quot;Run&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Excluding particular features from the build

Since version 7.2.0, you may instruct the build to exclude code for some features - for example, if you don&#039;t need support for native ads:

```
gulp build --disable NATIVE --modules=openxBidAdapter,rubiconBidAdapter,sovrnBidAdapter # substitute your module list
```

Features that can be disabled this way are:

 - `VIDEO` - support for video bids;
 - `NATIVE` - support for native bids;
- `UID2_CSTG` - support for UID2 client side token generation (see [Unified ID 2.0](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/modules/userid-submodules/unified2.html))
- `GREEDY` - disables the use blocking, &quot;greedy&quot; promises within Prebid (see [note](#greedy-promise)).
- `LOG_NON_ERROR` - support for non-error console messages. (see [note](#log-features))
- `LOG_ERROR` - support for error console messages (see [note](#log-features))

`GREEDY` is disabled and all other features are enabled when no features are explicitly chosen. Use `--enable GREEDY` on the `gulp build` command or remove it from `disableFeatures` to restore the original behavior. If you disable any feature, you must explicitly also disable `GREEDY` to get the default behavior on promises.

&lt;a id=&quot;greedy-promise&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

#### Greedy promises

When `GREEDY` is enabled, Prebid attempts to hold control of the main thread when possible, using a [custom implementation of `Promise`](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/master/libraries/greedy/greedyPromise.js) that does not submit callbacks to the scheduler once the promise is resolved (running them immediately instead).
Disabling this behavior instructs Prebid to use the standard `window.Promise` instead; this has the effect of breaking up task execution, making them slower overall but giving the browser more chances to run other tasks in between, which can improve UX.         

You may also override the `Promise` constructor used by Prebid through `pbjs.Promise`, for example:

```javascript
var pbjs = pbjs || {};
pbjs.Promise = myCustomPromiseConstructor;
```

&lt;a id=&quot;log-features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

#### Logging

Disabling `LOG_NON_ERROR` and `LOG_ERROR` removes most logging statements from source, which can save on bundle size. Beware, however, that there is no test coverage with either of these disabled. Turn them off at your own risk.

Disabling logging — especially `LOG_ERROR` — also makes debugging more difficult. Consider building a separate version with logging enabled for debugging purposes.

We suggest running the build with logging off only if you are able to confirm a real world metric improvement via a testing framework. Using this build without such a framework may result in unexpectedly worse performance.

## Unminified code

You can get a version of the code that&#039;s unminified for debugging with `build-bundle-dev`:

```bash
gulp build-bundle-dev --modules=bidderA,module1,...
```

The results will be in build/dev/prebid.js.

## ES5 Output Support

For compatibility with older parsers or environments that require ES5 syntax, you can generate ES5-compatible output using the `--ES5` flag:

```bash
gulp build-bundle-dev --modules=bidderA,module1,... --ES5
```

This will:
- Transpile all code to ES5 syntax using CommonJS modules
- Target browsers: IE11+, Chrome 50+, Firefox 50+, Safari 10+
- Ensure compatibility with older JavaScript parsers

**Note:** Without the `--ES5` flag, the build will use modern ES6+ syntax by default for better performance and smaller bundle sizes.

## Test locally

To lint the code:

```bash
gulp lint
```

To lint and only show errors

```bash
gulp lint --no-lint-warnings
```

To run the unit tests:

```bash
gulp test
```

To run the unit tests for a particular file (example for pubmaticBidAdapter_spec.js):
```bash
gulp test --file &quot;test/spec/modules/pubmaticBidAdapter_spec.js&quot; --nolint
```

To generate and view the code coverage reports:

```bash
gulp test-coverage
gulp view-coverage
```

Local end-to-end testing can be done with:

```bash
gulp e2e-test --local
```

For Prebid.org members with access to BrowserStack, additional end-to-end testing can be done with:

```bash
gulp e2e-test --host=test.localhost
```

To run these tests, the following items are required:
- setup an alias of localhost in your `hosts` file (eg `127.0.0.1  test.localhost`); note - you can use any alias.  Use this alias in the command-line argument above.
- access to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) account.  Assign the following variables in your bash_profile:
```bash
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=&#039;YourUserNameHere&#039;
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=&#039;YourAccessKeyHere&#039;
```
You can get these BrowserStack values from your profile page.

For development:

```javascript
(function() {
    var d = document, pbs = d.createElement(&#039;script&#039;), pro = d.location.protocol;
    pbs.type = &#039;text/javascript&#039;;
    pbs.src = ((pro === &#039;https:&#039;) ? &#039;https&#039; : &#039;http&#039;) + &#039;./build/dev/prebid.js&#039;;
    var target = document.getElementsByTagName(&#039;head&#039;)[0];
    target.insertBefore(pbs, target.firstChild);
})();
```

For deployment:

```javascript
(function() {
    var d = document, pbs = d.createElement(&#039;script&#039;), pro = d.location.protocol;
    pbs.type = &#039;text/javascript&#039;;
    pbs.src = ((pro === &#039;https:&#039;) ? &#039;https&#039; : &#039;http&#039;) + &#039;./build/dist/prebid.js&#039;;
    var target = document.getElementsByTagName(&#039;head&#039;)[0];
    target.insertBefore(pbs, target.firstChild);
})();
```

Build and run the project locally with:

```bash
gulp serve
```

This runs `lint` and `test`, then starts a web server at `http://localhost:9999` serving from the project root.
Navigate to your example implementation to test, and if your `prebid.js` file is sourced from the `./build/dev`
directory you will have sourcemaps available in your browser&#039;s developer tools.

To run the example file, go to:

+ `http://localhost:9999/integrationExamples/gpt/hello_world.html`

As you make code changes, the bundles will be rebuilt and the page reloaded automatically.

=============
BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn.  

BigBlueButton supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard annotations), chat, and the screen.  Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboards, shared notes, and breakout rooms.  During the session, BigBlueButton generates analytics that are visible to moderators in the Learning Analytics Dashboard.

Presenters can record and playback content for later sharing with others.

We designed BigBlueButton for online learning, it can be used for many other applications as well.  The educational use cases for BigBlueButton are

  * Online tutoring (one-to-one)
  * Flipped classrooms (recording content ahead of your session)
  * Group collaboration (many-to-many)
  * Online classes (one-to-many)

The latest version is BigBlueButton 3.0.  You can install BigBlueButton it on Ubuntu 22.04 using [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) within 30 minutes (or your money back 😉).

For full technical documentation of BigBlueButton -- including architecture, features, API, and GreenLight (the default front-end) -- see [https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/).

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don&#039;t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from &#039;react-dom/client&#039;;

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(&#039;container&#039;));
root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name=&quot;Taylor&quot; /&gt;);
```

This example will render &quot;Hello Taylor&quot; into a container on the page.

You&#039;ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.
