## üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility

Zen is currently built using Firefox version `138.0.1`! üöÄ

- [`Zen Twilight`](https://zen-browser.app/download?twilight) - Is currently built using Firefox version `RC 138.0.1`!
- Check out the latest [release notes](https://zen-browser.app/release-notes)!
- Part of our mission is to keep Zen up-to-date with the latest version of Firefox, so you can enjoy the latest features and security updates!

## ü§ù Contribution

Zen is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community! Please take a look at the [contribution guidelines](./docs/contribute.md) before getting started!

### Issue metrics

We keep track of how many issues are closed at the end of the month in [docs/issue-metrics](./docs/issue-metrics). We use this to keep track of our issues and see our progress! üìà

### Versioning

Zen uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), meaning versions are displayed as `a.b.cd` where:

- `a` is the major version
- `b` is the minor version
- `c` is the branch prefix
- `d` is the patch version

### Branches

Zen is divided into 2 main branches. We use `dev` for development and `stable` for stable releases. The `dev` branch is where all the new features are added and where `twilight` builds are generated. The `stable` branch is where the stable releases are generated.

We divide into 2 branches in case there&#039;s any really important security update (for example) that needs to be released before the next stable release. This allows us to do patches without releasing unstable versions to the public.

## üì• Installation

### Supported Operating Systems

Zen is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can download the latest version from the official website at [zen-browser.app](https://zen-browser.app/download), or from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/releases) page.

If you don&#039;t see your OS listed below, that&#039;s because we already have it in our [downloads page](https://zen-browser.app/download)! Make sure to check it out!

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

[![GSAP - Animate anything](https://gsap.com/GSAP-share-image.png)](http://gsap.com)

GSAP is a **framework-agnostic** JavaScript animation library that turns developers into animation superheroes. Build high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser. Animate CSS, SVG, canvas, React, Vue, WebGL, colors, strings, motion paths, generic objects...anything JavaScript can touch! GSAP&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/&quot;&gt;ScrollTrigger&lt;/a&gt; plugin delivers jaw-dropping scroll-based animations with minimal code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.matchMedia()&quot;&gt;gsap.matchMedia()&lt;/a&gt; makes building responsive, accessibility-friendly animations a breeze.

No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, and tight control while solving real-world problems on over 12 million sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations ***just work***. At its core, GSAP is a high-speed property manipulator, updating values over time with extreme accuracy. It&#039;s up to 20x faster than jQuery!

GSAP is completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want. **Zero dependencies.**

There are many optional &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases&quot;&gt;easing&lt;/a&gt; functions for achieving advanced effects easily like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/&quot;&gt;scrolling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin&quot;&gt;morphing&lt;/a&gt;, [text splitting](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText), animating along a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MotionPathPlugin&quot;&gt;motion path&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Flip/&quot;&gt;FLIP&lt;/a&gt; animations. There&#039;s even a handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt; for normalizing event detection across browsers/devices. 


### Get Started

[![Get Started with GSAP](http://gsap.com/_img/github/get-started.jpg)](http://gsap.com/get-started)


## Docs &amp;amp; Installation

View the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs&quot;&gt;full documentation here&lt;/a&gt;, including an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/install&quot;&gt;installation guide&lt;/a&gt;.

### CDN

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.13/dist/gsap.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jsdelivr.com/gsap&quot;&gt;JSDelivr&#039;s dedicated GSAP page&lt;/a&gt; for quick CDN links to the core files/plugins. There are more &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/install&quot;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; at gsap.com.

**Every major ad network excludes GSAP from file size calculations** and most have it on their own CDNs, so contact them for the appropriate URL(s). 

### NPM
See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/install&quot;&gt;guide to using GSAP via NPM here&lt;/a&gt;.

```javascript
npm install gsap
```

GSAP&#039;s core can animate almost anything including CSS and attributes, plus it includes all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods&quot;&gt;utility methods&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/interpolate()&quot;&gt;interpolate()&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/mapRange()&quot;&gt;mapRange()&lt;/a&gt;, most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases&quot;&gt;eases&lt;/a&gt;, and it can do snapping and modifiers. 

```javascript
// typical import
import gsap from &quot;gsap&quot;;

// get other plugins:
import ScrollTrigger from &quot;gsap/ScrollTrigger&quot;;
import Flip from &quot;gsap/Flip&quot;;
import Draggable from &quot;gsap/Draggable&quot;;

// or all tools are exported from the &quot;all&quot; file (excluding members-only plugins):
import { gsap, ScrollTrigger, Draggable, MotionPathPlugin } from &quot;gsap/all&quot;;

// don&#039;t forget to register plugins
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, Draggable, Flip, MotionPathPlugin); 
```

The NPM files are ES modules, but there&#039;s also a /dist/ directory with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/&quot;&gt;UMD&lt;/a&gt; files for extra compatibility.

## GSAP is FREE! 

Thanks to [Webflow](https://webflow.com), GSAP is now **100% FREE** including ALL of the bonus plugins like [SplitText](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText), [MorphSVG](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin), and all the others that were exclusively available to Club GSAP members. That&#039;s right - the entire GSAP toolset is FREE, even for commercial use! ü§Ø  Read more [here](https://webflow.com/blog/gsap-becomes-free)

### ScrollTrigger &amp;amp; ScrollSmoother

If you&#039;re looking for scroll-driven animations, GSAP&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/&quot;&gt;ScrollTrigger&lt;/a&gt; plugin is the standard. There&#039;s a companion &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother/&quot;&gt;ScrollSmoother&lt;/a&gt; as well.

[![ScrollTrigger](http://gsap.com/_img/github/scrolltrigger.jpg)](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger)

### Using React? 

There&#039;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gsap/react&quot;&gt;@gsap/react&lt;/a&gt; package that exposes a `useGSAP()` hook which is a drop-in replacement for `useEffect()`/`useLayoutEffect()`, automating cleanup tasks. Please read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsap.com/react&quot;&gt;React guide&lt;/a&gt; for details.

## How to Install üöÄ

### Installation via Python pip üêç

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker üê≥

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! üòÑ

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it‚Äôs often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch üåô

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

## Overview

This repository holds the build tools needed to build the Brave desktop browser for macOS, Windows, and Linux.  In particular, it fetches and syncs code from the projects defined in `package.json` and `src/brave/DEPS`:

  - [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git)
    - Fetches code via `depot_tools`.
    - Sets the branch for Chromium (ex: 65.0.3325.181).
  - [brave-core](https://github.com/brave/brave-core)
    - Mounted at `src/brave`.
    - Maintains patches for 3rd party Chromium code.
  - [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust)
    - Implements Brave&#039;s ad-block engine.
    - Linked through [brave/adblock-rust-ffi](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/tree/master/components/adblock_rust_ffi).

## Install prerequisites

Follow the instructions for your platform:

- [macOS](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/macOS-Development-Environment)
- [iOS](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/iOS-Development-Environment)
- [Windows](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Windows-Development-Environment)
- [Linux](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Linux-Development-Environment)
- [Android](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Android-Development-Environment)

## Clone and initialize the repo

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can get the code and initialize the build environment.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brave/brave-core.git path-to-your-project-folder/src/brave
cd path-to-your-project-folder/src/brave
npm install

# the Chromium source is downloaded, which has a large history (gigabytes of data)
# this might take really long to finish depending on internet speed

npm run init
```
brave-core based android builds should use `npm run init -- --target_os=android --target_arch=arm` (or whichever CPU type you want to build for)
brave-core based iOS builds should use `npm run init -- --target_os=ios`

You can also set the target_os and target_arch for init and build using:

```
npm config set target_os android
npm config set target_arch arm
```

Additional parameters needed to build are documented at https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Build-configuration

Internal developers can find more information at https://github.com/brave/devops/wiki/%60.env%60-config-for-Brave-Developers

## Build Brave
The default build type is component.

```
# start the component build compile
npm run build
```

To do a release build:

```
# start the release compile
npm run build Release
```

brave-core based android builds should use `npm run build -- --target_os=android --target_arch=arm` or set the npm config variables as specified above for `init`

brave-core based iOS builds should use the Xcode project found in `ios/brave-ios/App`. You can open this project directly or run `npm run ios_bootstrap -- --open_xcodeproj` to have it opened in Xcode. See the [iOS Developer Environment](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/iOS-Development-Environment#Building) for more information on iOS builds.

### Build Configurations

Running a release build with `npm run build Release` can be very slow and use a lot of RAM, especially on Linux with the Gold LLVM plugin.

To run a statically linked build (takes longer to build, but starts faster):

```bash
npm run build -- Static
```

To run a debug build (Component build with is_debug=true):

```bash
npm run build -- Debug
```
NOTE: the build will take a while to complete. Depending on your processor and memory, it could potentially take a few hours.

## Run Brave
To start the build:

`npm start [Release|Component|Static|Debug]`

# Update Brave

`npm run sync -- [--force] [--init] [--create] [brave_core_ref]`

**This will attempt to stash your local changes in brave-core, but it&#039;s safer to commit local changes before running this**

`npm run sync` will (depending on the below flags):

1. üì• Update sub-projects (chromium, brave-core) to latest commit of a git ref (e.g. tag or branch)
2. ü§ï Apply patches
3. üîÑ Update gclient DEPS dependencies
4. ‚è© Run hooks (e.g. to perform `npm install` on child projects)

| flag | Description |
|---|---|
|`[no flags]`|updates chromium if needed and re-applies patches. If the chromium version did not change, it will only re-apply patches that have changed. Will update child dependencies **only if any project needed updating during this script run**. &lt;br&gt; **Use this if you want the script to manage keeping you up to date instead of pulling or switching branches manually. **|
|`--force`|updates both _Chromium_ and _brave-core_ to the latest remote commit for the current brave-core branch and the _Chromium_ ref specified in brave-browser/package.json (e.g. `master` or `74.0.0.103`). Will re-apply all patches. Will force update all child dependencies. &lt;br&gt; **Use this if you&#039;re having trouble and want to force the branches back to a known state. **|
|`--init`|force update both _Chromium_ and _brave-core_ to the versions specified in brave-browser/package.json and force updates all dependent repos - same as `npm run init`|
|`--sync_chromium (true/false)`|Will force or skip the chromium version update when applicable. Useful if you want to avoid a minor update when not ready for the larger build time a chromium update may result in. A warning will be output about the current code state expecting a different chromium version. Your build may fail as a result.|
|`-D, --delete_unused_deps`|Will delete from the working copy any dependencies that have been removed since the last sync. Mimics `gclient sync -D`.|

Run `npm run sync brave_core_ref` to checkout the specified _brave-core_ ref and update all dependent repos including chromium if needed.

## Scenarios

#### Create a new branch:
```bash
brave-browser&gt; cd src/brave
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; git checkout -b branch_name
```

#### Checkout an existing branch or tag:
```bash
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; git fetch origin
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; git checkout [-b] branch_name
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; npm run sync
...Updating 2 patches...
...Updating child dependencies...
...Running hooks...
```

#### Update the current branch to the latest remote:
```bash
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; git pull
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; npm run sync
...Updating 2 patches...
...Updating child dependencies...
...Running hooks...
```

#### Reset to latest brave-browser master and brave-core master (via `init`, will always result in a longer build and will remove any pending changes in your brave-core working directory):
```bash
brave-browser&gt; git checkout master
brave-browser&gt; git pull
brave-browser&gt; npm run sync -- --init
```

#### When you know that DEPS didn&#039;t change, but .patch files did (quickest attempt to perform a mini-sync before a build):
```bash
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; git checkout featureB
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; git pull
brave-browser/src/brave&gt; cd ../..
brave-browser&gt; npm run apply_patches
...Applying 2 patches...
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># React - The Complete Guide Course Resources

This repository provides access to code files, code snapshots, slides &amp; other resources that are used or provided by the [React - The Complete Guide](https://acad.link/reactjs) course.

If you&#039;re facing any issues with the code, please post in the course Q&amp;A section.

# Repository Content

- **Code Snapshots:** All code snapshots (starting snapshots, intermediate snapshots, finished snapshots) for the various course sections can be found in the [/code](/code/) folder.
- **Lecture Attachments:** Any standalone code files or other attachments that are mentioned in course lectures (and attached to those lectures) are stored in the [/attachments](/attachments/) folder.
- **Other Resources:** Other resources (like the course slides) can be found in the [/other](/other/) folder.

The **Code Snapshots** and **Lecture Attachments** folders contain one subfolder per course section - this allows you to easily access the resources for a specific course section.

# How To Use Code Snapshots

Code snapshots are primarily provided to allow you to compare your code to mine. The snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and therefore reflect my code you see in the videos.

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine. You&#039;ll need to run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server - just as shown in the course.

## Bug reporting

Please make sure the issue you&#039;re reporting involves SvelteKit. Many issues related to how a project builds originate from [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which is used to build a SvelteKit project. You can create a new Vite project with `npm create vite@latest` for client-side only repros and `npm create vite-extra@latest` for SSR or library repros.

If an issue originates from Vite, please report it in the [Vite issue tracker](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues).

_&lt;sup&gt;On the sidebar: flicking the notification&lt;/sup&gt;_

### Intuitive window management
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02983b9b-79ba-4c25-8717-90bef2357ae5)

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

Typed.js is a library that types. Enter in any string, and watch it type at the speed you&#039;ve set, backspace what it&#039;s typed, and begin a new sentence for however many strings you&#039;ve set.

---

## Installation

### CDN

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/typed.js@2.1.0/dist/typed.umd.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

For use directly in the browser via `&lt;script&gt;` tag:

```html
  &lt;!-- Element to contain animated typing --&gt;
  &lt;span id=&quot;element&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;!-- Load library from the CDN --&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/typed.js@2.1.0/dist/typed.umd.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;!-- Setup and start animation! --&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    var typed = new Typed(&#039;#element&#039;, {
      strings: [&#039;&lt;i&gt;First&lt;/i&gt; sentence.&#039;, &#039;&amp;amp; a second sentence.&#039;],
      typeSpeed: 50,
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

### As an ESModule

For use with a build tool like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and/or in a React application, install with NPM or Yarn.

#### NPM

```
npm install typed.js
```

#### Yarn

```
yarn add typed.js
```

#### General ESM Usage

```js
import Typed from &#039;typed.js&#039;;

const typed = new Typed(&#039;#element&#039;, {
  strings: [&#039;&lt;i&gt;First&lt;/i&gt; sentence.&#039;, &#039;&amp;amp; a second sentence.&#039;],
  typeSpeed: 50,
});
```

### ReactJS Usage

```js
import React from &#039;react&#039;;
import Typed from &#039;typed.js&#039;;

function MyComponent() {
  // Create reference to store the DOM element containing the animation
  const el = React.useRef(null);

  React.useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const typed = new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: [&#039;&lt;i&gt;First&lt;/i&gt; sentence.&#039;, &#039;&amp;amp; a second sentence.&#039;],
      typeSpeed: 50,
    });

    return () =&gt; {
      // Destroy Typed instance during cleanup to stop animation
      typed.destroy();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span ref={el} /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

### Strings from static HTML (SEO Friendly)

Rather than using the `strings` array to insert strings, you can place an HTML `div` on the page and read from it.
This allows bots and search engines, as well as users with JavaScript disabled, to see your text on the page.

```javascript
&lt;script&gt;
  var typed = new Typed(&#039;#typed&#039;, {
    stringsElement: &#039;#typed-strings&#039;
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
```

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;typed-strings&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Typed.js is a &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; out sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;typed&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
```

### Type Pausing

You can pause in the middle of a string for a given amount of time by including an escape character.

```javascript
var typed = new Typed(&#039;#element&#039;, {
  // Waits 1000ms after typing &quot;First&quot;
  strings: [&#039;First ^1000 sentence.&#039;, &#039;Second sentence.&#039;],
});
```

### Smart Backspacing

In the following example, this would only backspace the words after &quot;This is a&quot;

```javascript
var typed = new Typed(&#039;#element&#039;, {
  strings: [&#039;This is a JavaScript library&#039;, &#039;This is an ES6 module&#039;],
  smartBackspace: true, // Default value
});
```

### Bulk Typing

The following example would emulate how a terminal acts when typing a command and seeing its result.

```javascript
var typed = new Typed(&#039;#element&#039;, {
  strings: [&#039;git push --force ^1000\n `pushed to origin with option force`&#039;],
});
```

### CSS

CSS animations are built upon initialization in JavaScript. But, you can customize them at your will! These classes are:

```css
/* Cursor */
.typed-cursor {
}

/* If fade out option is set */
.typed-fade-out {
}
```

## Customization

```javascript
var typed = new Typed(&#039;#element&#039;, {
  /**
   * @property {array} strings strings to be typed
   * @property {string} stringsElement ID of element containing string children
   */
  strings: [
    &#039;These are the default values...&#039;,
    &#039;You know what you should do?&#039;,
    &#039;Use your own!&#039;,
    &#039;Have a great day!&#039;,
  ],
  stringsElement: null,

  /**
   * @property {number} typeSpeed type speed in milliseconds

   */
  backSpeed: 0,

  /**
   * @property {boolean} smartBackspace only backspace what doesn&#039;t match the previous string
   */
  smartBackspace: true,

  /**
   * @property {boolean} shuffle shuffle the strings
   */
  shuffle: false,

  /**
   * @property {number} backDelay time before backspacing in milliseconds
   */
  backDelay: 700,

  /**
   * @property {boolean} fadeOut Fade out instead of backspace
   * @property {string} fadeOutClass css class for fade animation
   * @property {boolean} fadeOutDelay Fade out delay in milliseconds
   */
  fadeOut: false,
  fadeOutClass: &#039;typed-fade-out&#039;,
  fadeOutDelay: 500,

  /**
   * @property {boolean} loop loop strings
   * @property {number} loopCount amount of loops
   */
  loop: false,
  loopCount: Infinity,

  /**
   * @property {boolean} showCursor show cursor
   * @property {string} cursorChar character for cursor
   * @property {boolean} autoInsertCss insert CSS for cursor and fadeOut into HTML &lt;head&gt;
   */
  showCursor: true,
  cursorChar: &#039;|&#039;,
  autoInsertCss: true,

  /**
   * @property {string} attr attribute for typing
   * Ex: input placeholder, value, or just HTML text

   */
  bindInputFocusEvents: false,

  /**

   */
  contentType: &#039;html&#039;,

  /**

  onBegin: (self) =&gt; {},

  /**

4. For NPM: Run either `config=true npm start` or `$env:config=true; npm start` if you prefer NPM.


### Server Deployment

You must run these commands on your server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar
cd Interstellar
```

#### Ad-Free Deployment

```bash
git clone --branch Ad-Free https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar
cd Interstellar
```

Next depending on your package manager, run one of the following commands:

#### Bun

If you are using Bun, run the following commands:

```bash
bun i
bun start
```

#### pnpm

If you are using pnpm, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

#### npm

If you are using npm, run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

### Updating

```bash
cd Interstellar
git pull --force --allow-unrelated-histories # This may overwrite your local changes
```

### Deployment Alternatives

For more deployment options, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/interstellar) for various ways to deploy Interstellar.
This includes methods of deploying to Render/OnRender.

#### What happened to Replit Deployment?

As of January 1st, 2024, Replit is [no longer free](https://blog.replit.com/hosting-changes). Try GitHub Codespaces instead.

### GitHub Codespaces

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re setting the port below 1023, then you must run `sudo PORT=1023`

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven&#039;t already.
2. Click &quot;Code&quot; (green button) and then &quot;Create Codespace on main.&quot;
3. In the terminal at the bottom, paste `pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm start`.
4. Respond to the application popup by clicking &quot;Make public.&quot;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Make sure you click the &quot;Make public.&quot; button, or the proxy won&#039;t function properly.&lt;br&gt;
&gt; If you get a Range Error, go back and make sure you clicked Make public!
5. Access the deployed website from the ports tab.
6. For subsequent uses in the same codespace, just run `pnpm start`

### Solution for if there is no popup.

1. Run `pnpm i`, and before `pnpm start`, prepend `PORT=8080`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `PORT=6969 pnpm start`.
2. If this does not work then you can prepend `$env:PORT=8080;`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `$env:PORT=6969; pnpm start`
3. Go to the ports tab, Click Forward A Port, And type the port number.
4. Right-click Visibility and set Port Visibility to Public.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We are committed to making Interstellar easy and personalized however, as of now we need your support in making it ad-free. Consider keeping ads so Interstellar can run freely or contribute by being a supporter.

## Report Issues

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cockpit
**A sysadmin login session in a web browser**

[cockpit-project.org](https://cockpit-project.org/)

Cockpit is an interactive server admin interface. It is easy to use and very lightweight.
Cockpit interacts directly with the operating system from a real Linux session in a browser.

### Using Cockpit

You can [install Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/running.html) on many Linux operating
systems including Debian, Fedora and RHEL.

Cockpit makes Linux discoverable, allowing sysadmins to easily perform tasks such as starting
containers, storage administration, network configuration, inspecting logs and so on.

Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started via Cockpit
can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in the terminal, it can be seen
in the Cockpit journal interface.

You can also easily add other machines that have Cockpit installed and are accessible via SSH and jump
between these hosts.

[Pwnagotchi](https://pwnagotchi.org/) is an [A2C](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752)-based &quot;AI&quot; leveraging [bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/) that learns from its surrounding Wi-Fi environment to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either passively, or by performing authentication and association attacks). This material is collected as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/), including [PMKIDs](https://www.evilsocket.net/2019/02/13/Pwning-WiFi-networks-with-bettercap-and-the-PMKID-client-less-attack/), 
full and half WPA handshakes.

![ui](https://i.imgur.com/X68GXrn.png)

Instead of merely playing [Super Mario or Atari games](https://becominghuman.ai/getting-mario-back-into-the-gym-setting-up-super-mario-bros-in-openais-gym-8e39a96c1e41?gi=c4b66c3d5ced) like most reinforcement learning-based &quot;AI&quot; *(yawn)*, Pwnagotchi tunes [its parameters](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/pwnagotchi/defaults.toml) over time to **get better at pwning Wi-Fi things to** in the environments you expose it to. 

More specifically, Pwnagotchi is using an [LSTM with MLP feature extractor](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/policies.html#stable_baselines.common.policies.MlpLstmPolicy) as its policy network for the [A2C agent](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/a2c.html). If you&#039;re unfamiliar with A2C, here is [a very good introductory explanation](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752) (in comic form!) of the basic principles behind how Pwnagotchi learns. (You can read more about how Pwnagotchi learns in the [Usage](https://www.pwnagotchi.ai/usage/#training-the-ai) doc.)

**Keep in mind:** Unlike the usual RL simulations, Pwnagotchi learns over time. Time for a Pwnagotchi is measured in epochs; a single epoch can last from a few seconds to minutes, depending on how many access points and client stations are visible. Do not expect your Pwnagotchi to perform amazingly well at the very beginning, as it will be [exploring](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752) several combinations of [key parameters](https://www.pwnagotchi.ai/usage/#training-the-ai) to determine ideal adjustments for pwning the particular environment you are exposing it to during its beginning epochs ... but ** listen to your Pwnagotchi when it tells you it&#039;s boring!** Bring it into novel Wi-Fi environments with you and have it observe new networks and capture new handshakes‚Äîand you&#039;ll see. :)

Multiple units within close physical proximity can &quot;talk&quot; to each other, advertising their presence to each other by broadcasting custom information elements using a parasite protocol I&#039;ve built on top of the existing dot11 standard. Over time, two or more units trained together will learn to cooperate upon detecting each other&#039;s presence by dividing the available channels among them for optimal pwnage.
