## What is Label Studio?

&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

## Try out Label Studio

Install Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. Also you can try [Label Studio Teams](https://app.heartex.com).

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python &gt;=3.7 &lt;=3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you&#039;ve made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you&#039;re using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you&#039;re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‚Äë4.5.0‚Äëcp38‚Äëcp38‚Äëwin_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

#### Run test suite
```bash
pip install -r deploy/requirements-test.txt
cd label_studio

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass)
DJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto
```


## What you get from Label Studio

![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it&#039;s tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/templates-categories.jpg&quot; /&gt;

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).

## Self-hosting Screenity

You can run Screenity locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here&#039;s how:

1. Download the latest Build.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/releases)
2. Load the extension by pasting `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it&#039;s a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the &quot;Load unpacked&quot; button and locate the folder.
4. That&#039;s it, you should now be able to use Screenity locally. [Follow these instructions](#enabling-save-to-google-drive) to set up the Google Drive integration.

## Creating a development version

&gt; ‚ùóÔ∏è Note that the license has changed to [GPLv3](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/blob/master/LICENSE) for the current MV3 version (Screenity version 3.0.0 and higher). Make sure to read the license and the [Terms of Service](https://screenity.io/en/terms/) regarding intellectual property.

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is &gt;= **14**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Load the extension by going to `chrome://extensions/` , and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
6. Click on `Load unpacked extension`.
7. Select the `build` folder.

### Enabling Save to Google Drive

&gt; **Note:** After clicking the link, you&#039;ll still need to add your API keys to the configuration. The link installs the MCP server with placeholder keys that you&#039;ll need to replace with your actual API keys.

## Requirements

Taskmaster utilizes AI across several commands, and those require a separate API key. You can use a variety of models from different AI providers provided you add your API keys. For example, if you want to use Claude 3.7, you&#039;ll need an Anthropic API key.

You can define 3 types of models to be used: the main model, the research model, and the fallback model (in case either the main or research fail). Whatever model you use, its provider API key must be present in either mcp.json or .env.

At least one (1) of the following is required:

- Anthropic API key (Claude API)
- OpenAI API key
- Google Gemini API key
- Perplexity API key (for research model)
- xAI API Key (for research or main model)
- OpenRouter API Key (for research or main model)
- Claude Code (no API key required - requires Claude Code CLI)

Using the research model is optional but highly recommended. You will need at least ONE API key (unless using Claude Code). Adding all API keys enables you to seamlessly switch between model providers at will.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: MCP (Recommended)

MCP (Model Control Protocol) lets you run Task Master directly from your editor.

#### 1. Add your MCP config at the following path depending on your editor

| Editor       | Scope   | Linux/macOS Path                      | Windows Path                                      | Key          |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Cursor**   | Global  | `~/.cursor/mcp.json`                  | `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`                  | `mcpServers` |
|              | Project | `&lt;project_folder&gt;/.cursor/mcp.json`   | `&lt;project_folder&gt;\.cursor\mcp.json`               | `mcpServers` |
| **Windsurf** | Global  | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json` | `mcpServers` |
| **VS Code**  | Project | `&lt;project_folder&gt;/.vscode/mcp.json`   | `&lt;project_folder&gt;\.vscode\mcp.json`               | `servers`    |

##### Manual Configuration

###### Cursor &amp; Windsurf (`mcpServers`)

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;task-master-ai&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;--package=task-master-ai&quot;, &quot;task-master-ai&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;PERPLEXITY_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;GOOGLE_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;MISTRAL_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_MISTRAL_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;GROQ_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_GROQ_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;OPENROUTER_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_OPENROUTER_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;XAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_XAI_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_AZURE_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;OLLAMA_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_OLLAMA_API_KEY_HERE&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

&gt; üîë Replace `YOUR_‚Ä¶_KEY_HERE` with your real API keys. You can remove keys you don&#039;t use.

&gt; **Note**: If you see `0 tools enabled` in the MCP settings, try removing the `--package=task-master-ai` flag from `args`.

###### VS‚ÄØCode (`servers` + `type`)

```json
{
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;task-master-ai&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;--package=task-master-ai&quot;, &quot;task-master-ai&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;PERPLEXITY_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;GOOGLE_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;MISTRAL_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_MISTRAL_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;GROQ_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_GROQ_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;OPENROUTER_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_OPENROUTER_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;XAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_XAI_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_AZURE_KEY_HERE&quot;,
        &quot;OLLAMA_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_OLLAMA_API_KEY_HERE&quot;
      },
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

&gt; üîë Replace `YOUR_‚Ä¶_KEY_HERE` with your real API keys. You can remove keys you don&#039;t use.

#### 2. (Cursor-only) Enable Taskmaster MCP

Open Cursor Settings (Ctrl+Shift+J) ‚û° Click on MCP tab on the left ‚û° Enable task-master-ai with the toggle

#### 3. (Optional) Configure the models you want to use

In your editor&#039;s AI chat pane, say:

```txt
Change the main, research and fallback models to &lt;model_name&gt;, &lt;model_name&gt; and &lt;model_name&gt; respectively.
```

For example, to use Claude Code (no API key required):
```txt
Change the main model to claude-code/sonnet
```

[Table of available models](docs/models.md) | [Claude Code setup](docs/examples/claude-code-usage.md)

#### 4. Initialize Task Master

In your editor&#039;s AI chat pane, say:

```txt
Initialize taskmaster-ai in my project
```

#### 5. Make sure you have a PRD (Recommended)

For **new projects**: Create your PRD at `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`  
For **existing projects**: You can use `scripts/prd.txt` or migrate with `task-master migrate`

An example PRD template is available after initialization in `.taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt`.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; While a PRD is recommended for complex projects, you can always create individual tasks by asking &quot;Can you help me implement [description of what you want to do]?&quot; in chat.

**Always start with a detailed PRD.**

The more detailed your PRD, the better the generated tasks will be.

#### 6. Common Commands

Use your AI assistant to:

- Parse requirements: `Can you parse my PRD at scripts/prd.txt?`
- Plan next step: `What&#039;s the next task I should work on?`
- Implement a task: `Can you help me implement task 3?`
- View multiple tasks: `Can you show me tasks 1, 3, and 5?`
- Expand a task: `Can you help me expand task 4?`
- **Research fresh information**: `Research the latest best practices for implementing JWT authentication with Node.js`
- **Research with context**: `Research React Query v5 migration strategies for our current API implementation in src/api.js`

### Option 2: Using Command Line

#### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g task-master-ai

# OR install locally within your project
npm install task-master-ai
```

#### Initialize a new project

```bash
# If installed globally
task-master init

# If installed locally
npx task-master init

# Initialize project with specific rules
task-master init --rules cursor,windsurf,vscode
```

This will prompt you for project details and set up a new project with the necessary files and structure.

#### Common Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new project
task-master init

# Parse a PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd your-prd.txt

# List all tasks
task-master list

# Show the next task to work on
task-master next

# Show specific task(s) - supports comma-separated IDs
task-master show 1,3,5

# Research fresh information with project context
task-master research &quot;What are the latest best practices for JWT authentication?&quot;

# Generate task files
task-master generate

# Add rules after initialization
task-master rules add windsurf,roo,vscode
```

## Claude Code Support

Task Master now supports Claude models through the Claude Code CLI, which requires no API key:

- **Models**: `claude-code/opus` and `claude-code/sonnet`
- **Requirements**: Claude Code CLI installed
- **Benefits**: No API key needed, uses your local Claude instance

[Learn more about Claude Code setup](docs/examples/claude-code-usage.md)

## Troubleshooting

### If `task-master init` doesn&#039;t respond

Try running it with Node directly:

```bash
node node_modules/claude-task-master/scripts/init.js
```

Or clone the repository and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master.git
cd claude-task-master
node scripts/init.js
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># adb-mcp

adb-mcp is a proof of concept project to enabled AI control of Adobe tools (Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere) by providing an interface to LLMs via the MCP protocol.

The project is not endorsed by nor supported by Adobe.

It has been tested with Claude desktop (Mac and Windows) from Anthropic, as well as the OpenAI Agent SDK, and allows AI clients to control Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere. Theoretically, it should work with any AI App / LLM that supports the MCP protocol, and is built in a way to support multiple Adobe applications.

Example use cases include:

-   Giving Claude step by step instruction on what to do in Photoshop, providing a conversational based interface (particularly useful if you are new to Photoshop).
-   Giving Claude a task (create an instagram post that looks like a Polariod image, create a double exposure) and letting it create it from start to finish to use as a template.
-   Asking Claude to generate custom Photoshop tutorials for you, by creating an example file, then step by step instructions on how to recreate.
-   As a Photoshop utility tool (have Claude rename all of your layers into a consistent format)
-   Have Claude create new Premiere projects pre-populations with clips, transitions, effects and Audio

[View Video Examples](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrZcuHfRluqt5JQiKzMWefUb0Xumb7MkI)

The Premiere agent is a bit more limited in functionality compared to the Photoshop agent, due to current limitations of the Premiere plugin API.

## How it works

The proof of concept works by providing:

-   A MCP Server that provides an interface to functionality within Adobe Photoshop to the AI / LLM
-   A Node based command proxy server that sits between the MCP server and Adobe app plugins
-   An Adobe app (Photoshop and Premiere) plugin that listens for commands, and drives the programs

**AI** &lt;-&gt; **MCP Server** &lt;-&gt; **Command Proxy Server** &lt;-&gt; **Photoshop / Premiere UXP Plugin** &lt;-&gt; **Photoshop / Premiere**

The proxy server is required because the public facing API for UXP Based JavaScript plugin does not allow it to listen on a socket connection (as a server) for the MCP Server to connect to (it can only connect to a socket as a client).

## Requirements

In order to run this, the following is required:

-   AI LLM with support for MCP Protocol (tested with Claude desktop on Mac &amp; Windows, and OpenAI Agent SDK)
-   Python 3, which is used to run the MCP server provided with this project
-   NodeJS, used to provide a proxy between the MCP server and Photoshop
-   Adobe UXP Developer tool (available via Creative Cloud) used to install and debug the Photoshop / Premiere plugin used to connect to the proxy
-   Adobe Photoshop (26.0 or greater) with the MCP Plugin installed or Adobe Premiere Beta (25.3 Build 46 or greater)


## Installation

This guide assumes you&#039;re using Claude Desktop. Other MCP-compatible AI applications should work similarly.

Choose your installation method:

### Quick Start (Recommended for Testing)

Use this method if you want to try the system without modifying code.

#### 1. Download Release Files
Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/mikechambers/adb-mcp/releases), including:
- Source code
- Claude MCP installers (.dxt files)
- Adobe plugins (.ccx files)

#### 2. Install Claude Desktop
1. Download and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Launch Claude Desktop to verify it works

#### 3. Install MCP in Claude Desktop
1. Launch Claude Desktop
2. Double-click the appropriate .dxt file:
   - `photoshop-mcp.dxt` for Photoshop
   - `premiere-mcp.dxt` for Premiere Pro
3. Restart Claude Desktop

#### Using Prebuilt Executables (Recommended)

1. Download the appropriate executable for your platform from the latest release (files named like `adb-proxy-socket-macos-x64.zip` (Intel), `adb-proxy-socket-macos-arm64.zip` (Silicon), or `adb-proxy-socket-win-x64.exe.zip`).
2. Unzip the executable.
3. From the terminal or console run the executable:

   - **macOS** (Intel or Apple Silicon):
     ```bash
     ./adb-proxy-socket-macos-x64
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     ./adb-proxy-socket-macos-arm64
     ```
   - **Windows**:  
     Double-click `adb-proxy-socket-win.exe` or run in Command Prompt:
     ```cmd
     adb-proxy-socket-win.exe
     ```

4. You should see a message like:  
   `Photoshop MCP Command proxy server running on ws://localhost:3001`

5. **Keep this running** ‚Äî the proxy server must stay active for Claude to communicate with Adobe plugins.


#### 5. Install Adobe Plugins
1. Open the Adobe application you want to use (Photoshop or Premiere Pro)
2. Download and launch **Adobe UXP Developer Tools** from Creative Cloud
3. In UXP Developer Tools: **File &gt; Add Plugin**
4. Select the appropriate .ccx file from your downloads
5. Click **Load** to install the plugin
6. In your Adobe application, find the plugin panel:
   - **Photoshop**: Plugins menu
   - **Premiere Pro**: Window &gt; UXP Plugins menu
7. Click **Connect** in the plugin panel

### Development Setup

Use this method if you want to modify the code or access the latest features.

```

**For Premiere Pro:**
```bash
uv run mcp install --with fonttools --with python-socketio --with mcp --with requests --with websocket-client --with pillow pr-mcp.py
```

Restart Claude Desktop after installation.

#### 4. Set Up Proxy Server
Same as Quick Start step 4.

#### 5. Enable Developer Mode in Adobe Applications

**For Photoshop:**
1. Launch Photoshop (2025/26.0 or greater)
2. Go to **Settings &gt; Plugins** and check **&quot;Enable Developer Mode&quot;**
3. Restart Photoshop

**For Premiere Pro:**
1. Launch Premiere Pro Beta (25.3 or greater)
2. Developer mode should be available by default in the beta

#### 6. Install Plugins for Development

2. Enable developer mode when prompted
3. Select **File &gt; Add Plugin**
4. Navigate to the appropriate directory and select **manifest.json**:
   - **Photoshop**: `uxp/ps/manifest.json`
   - **Premiere Pro**: `uxp/pr/manifest.json`
5. Click **Load**
6. In your Adobe application, open the plugin panel and click **Connect**

## Using Claude with Adobe Apps

Launch the following:

1. Claude Desktop
2. adb-proxy-socket node server
3. Launch Photoshop and / or Premiere

_TIP: Create a project for Photoshop / Premiere Pro in Claude and pre-load any app specific instructions in its Project knowledge._

### Photoshop
1. Launch UXP Developer Tool and click the Load button for _Photoshop MCP Agent_
2. In Photoshop, if the MCP Agent panel is not open, open _Plugins &gt; Photoshop MCP Agent &gt; Photoshop MCP Agent_
3. Click connect in the agent panel in Photoshop

Now you can switch over the Claude desktop. Before you start a session, you should load the instructions resource which will provide guidance and info the Claude by clicking the socket icon (Attach from MCP) and then _Choose an Integration_ &gt; _Adobe Photoshop_ &gt; _config://get_instructions_.



### Premiere
4. Launch UXP Developer Tool and click the Load button for _Premiere MCP Agent_
5. In Premiere, if the MCP Agent panel is not open, open _Window &gt; UXP Plugins &gt; Premiere MCP Agent &gt; Premiere MCP Agent_
6. Click connect in the agent panel in Photoshop

Now you can switch over the Claude desktop. Before you start a session, you should load the instructions resource which will provide guidance and info the Claude by clicking the socket icon (Attach from MCP) and then _Choose an Integration_ &gt; _Adobe Premiere &gt; _config://get_instructions_.


Note, you must reload the plugin via the UCP Developer app every time you restart Photoshop and Premiere.

### Setting up session

In the chat input field, click the &quot;+&quot; button. From there click &quot;Add from Adobe Photoshop / Premiere&quot; then select *config://get_instructions*. This will load the instructions into the prompt. Submit that to Claude and once it processes it, you are ready to go.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/claud-attach-mcp.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;

This will help reduce errors when the AI is using the app.


### Prompting

At anytime, you can ask the following:

```
Can you list what apis / functions are available for working with Photoshop / Premiere?
```

and it will list out all of the functionality available.

When prompting, you do not need to reference the APIs, just use natural language to give instructions.

For example:

```
Create a new Photoshop file with a blue background, that is 1080 width by 720 height at 300 dpi
```

```
Create a new Photoshop file for an instagram post
```

```
Create a double exposure image in Photoshop of a woman and a forest
```

```
Generate an image of a forest, and then add a clipping mask to only show the center in a circle
```
```
Make something cool with photoshop
```

```
Add cross fade transitions between all of the clips on the timeline in Premiere
```


### Tips

#### General
* When asking AI to view the content in Photoshop / Premiere Pro, you can see the image returned in the Tool Call item in the chat. It will appear once the entire response has been added to the chat.
* When prompting, ask the AI to think about and check its work.
* The more you guide it (i.e. &quot;consider using clipping masks&quot;) the better the results
* The more advanced the model, or the more resources given to the model the better and more creative the AI is.
* As a general rule, don&#039;t make changes in the Adobe Apps while the AI is doing work. If you do make changes, make sure to tell the AI about it.
* The AI will learn from its mistakes, but will lose its memory once you start a new chat. You can guide it to do things in a different way, and then ask it to start over and it should follow the new approach.

The AI currently has access to a subset of Photoshop / Premiere functionality. In general, the approach has been to provide lower level tools to give the AI the basics to do more complex stuff.

The Photoshop plugin has more functionality that Premiere.

By default, the AI cannot access files directly, although if you install the [Claude File System MCP server](https://www.claudemcp.com/servers/filesystem) it can access, and load files into Photoshop / Premiere (open files and embed images).

#### Photoshop

* You can ask the AI to look at the content of the Photoshop file and it should be able to then see the output.
* The AI currently has issue sizing and positioning text correctly, so giving it guidelines on font sizes to use will help, as well as telling it to align the text relative to the canvas.
* The AI has access to all of the Postscript fonts on the system. If you want to specify a font, you must use its Postscript name (you may be able to ask the AI for it).
* You can ask the AI for suggestions. It comes up with really useful ideas / feedback sometimes.

#### Premiere

* Currently the plugin assumes you are just working with a single sequence.
* Pair the Premiere Pro MCP with the [media-utils-mcp](https://github.com/mikechambers/media-utils-mcp) to expand functionality.


### Troubleshooting

#### MCP won&#039;t run in Claude

If you get an error when running Claude that the MCP is not working, you may need to edit your Claude config file and put an absolute path for the UV command. More info [here](https://github.com/mikechambers/adb-mcp/issues/5#issuecomment-2829817624).

#### All fonts not available

The MCP server will return a list of available fonts, but depending on the number of fonts installed on your system, may omit some to work around the amount of data that can be send to the AI. By default it will list the first 1000 fonts sorted in alphabetical order.

You can tell the AI to use a specific font, using its postscript name.

#### Plugin won&#039;t install or connect

*   Make sure the app is running before you try to load the plugin.
*   In the UXP developer tool click the debug button next to load, and see if there are any errors.
*   Make sure the node / proxy server is running. If you plugin connects you should see output similar to:

```
adb-mcp Command proxy server running on ws://localhost:3001
User connected: Ud6L4CjMWGAeofYAAAAB
Client Ud6L4CjMWGAeofYAAAAB registered for application: photoshop
```

*   When you press the connect button, if it still says &quot;Connect&quot; it means there was either an error, or it can&#039;t connect to the proxy server. You can view the error in the UXP Developer App, by opening the Developer Workspace and click &quot;Debug&quot;.

#### Errors within AI client

* If something fails on the AI side, it will usually tell you the issue. If you click the command / code box, you can see the error.
* The first thing to check if there is an issue is to make sure the plugin in Photoshop / Premiere is connected, and that the node proxy server is running.
* If response times get really slow, check if the AI servers are under load, and that you do not have too much text in the current conversation (restarting a new chat can sometimes help speed up, but you will lose the context).

If you continue to have issues post an [issue](https://github.com/mikechambers/adb-mcp/issuesrd.gg/fgxw9t37D7). Include as much information as you can (OS, App, App version, and debug info or errors).

## Development

Adding new functionality is relatively easy, and requires:

1. Adding the API and parameters in the *mcp/ps-mcp.py* / *mcp/pr-mcp.py* file (which is used by the AI)
2. Implementing the API in the *uxp/ps/commands/index.js* / *uxp/pr/commands/index.js* file.

Meetings are currently held on the [matrix.org platform](https://matrix.to/#/#jquery_meeting:gitter.im).

Meeting minutes can be found at [meetings.jquery.org](https://meetings.jquery.org/category/core/).

The latest version of jQuery is available at [https://jquery.com/download/](https://jquery.com/download/).

## Version support

Learn more about our [version support](https://jquery.com/support/).

## Contribution Guides

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)

### References to issues/PRs

GitHub issues/PRs are usually referenced via `gh-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue/PR. You can find such an issue/PR under `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/NUMBER`.

jQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under [bugs.jquery.com](https://bugs.jquery.com/). It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern `trac-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under `https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/NUMBER`.

## Environments in which to use jQuery

- [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/)
- jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.

## What you need to build your own jQuery

To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

For Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.

## How to build your own jQuery

First, [clone the jQuery git repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Then, enter the jquery directory, install dependencies, and run the build script:

```bash
cd jquery
npm install
npm run build
```

The built version of jQuery will be placed in the `dist/` directory, along with a minified copy and associated map file.

## Build all jQuery release files

To build all variants of jQuery, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build:all
```

This will create all of the variants that jQuery includes in a release, including `jquery.js`, `jquery.slim.js`, `jquery.module.js`, and `jquery.slim.module.js` along their associated minified files and sourcemaps.

`jquery.module.js` and `jquery.slim.module.js` are [ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that export `jQuery` and `$` as named exports are placed in the `dist-module/` directory rather than the `dist/` directory.

## Building a Custom jQuery

The build script can be used to create a custom version of jQuery that includes only the modules you need.

Any module may be excluded except for `core`. When excluding `selector`, it is not removed but replaced with a small wrapper around native `querySelectorAll` (see below for more information).

### Build Script Help

To see the full list of available options for the build script, run the following:

```bash
npm run build -- --help
```

### Modules

To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the `src` folder (without the `.js` extension) to the `--exclude` option. When using the `--include` option, the default includes are dropped and a build is created with only those modules.

Some example modules that can be excluded or included are:

- **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.
- **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.
- **ajax/script**: The `&lt;script&gt;` AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.
- **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.
- **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).
- **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.
- **deprecated**: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.
- **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.
- **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(&quot;slow&quot;)`.
- **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.
- **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.
- **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.
- **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.
- **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(&quot;ready&quot;, ...)` or similar will not be triggered.
- **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.
- **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.
- **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.

- **selector**: The full jQuery selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced with a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser&#039;s `querySelectorAll` method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the [selector-native.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/src/selector-native.js) file for details.

*Note*: Excluding the full `selector` module will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as `effects/animatedSelector` and `css/hiddenVisibleSelectors`).

##### AMD name

You can set the module name for jQuery&#039;s AMD definition. By default, it is set to &quot;jquery&quot;, which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you&#039;d like to change this. Pass it to the `--amd` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --amd=&quot;custom-name&quot;
```

Or, to define anonymously, leave the name blank.

```bash
npm run build -- --amd
```

##### File name and directory

The default name for the built jQuery file is `jquery.js`; it is placed under the `dist/` directory. It&#039;s possible to change the file name using `--filename` and the directory using `--dir`. `--dir` is relative to the project root.

```bash
npm run build -- --slim --filename=&quot;jquery.slim.js&quot; --dir=&quot;/tmp&quot;
```

This would create a slim version of jQuery and place it under `tmp/jquery.slim.js`.

##### ECMAScript Module (ESM) mode

By default, jQuery generates a regular script JavaScript file. You can also generate an ECMAScript module exporting `jQuery` as the default export using the `--esm` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.module.js --esm
```

##### Factory mode

By default, jQuery depends on a global `window`. For environments that don&#039;t have one, you can generate a factory build that exposes a function accepting `window` as a parameter that you can provide externally (see [`README` of the published package](build/fixtures/README.md) for usage instructions). You can generate such a factory using the `--factory` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.js --factory
```

This option can be mixed with others like `--esm` or `--slim`:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.slim.module.js --factory --esm --slim --dir=&quot;/dist-module&quot;
```

#### Custom Build Examples

Create a custom build using `npm run build`, listing the modules to be excluded. Excluding a top-level module also excludes its corresponding directory of modules.

Exclude all **ajax** functionality:

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=ajax
```

Excluding **css** removes modules depending on CSS: **effects**, **offset**, **dimensions**.

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=css
```

Exclude a bunch of modules (`-e` is an alias for `--exclude`):

```bash
npm run build -- -e ajax/jsonp -e css -e deprecated -e dimensions -e effects -e offset -e wrap
```

There is a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.js --slim
```

Or, to create the slim build as an esm module:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.module.js --slim --esm
```

*Non-official custom builds are not regularly tested. Use them at your own risk.*

## Running the Unit Tests

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start `npm start` to auto-build jQuery as you work:

```bash
npm start
```

Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the &quot;test&quot; directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:

- Windows: [WAMP download](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
- Mac: [MAMP download](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
- Linux: [Setting up LAMP](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/easy-lamp-server-installation/)
- [Mongoose (most platforms)](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)

## Essential Git

As the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it&#039;s useful to know some features used.

### Cleaning

If you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you&#039;ve worked on is gone after these):

```bash
git reset --hard upstream/main
git clean -fdx
```

### Rebasing

For feature/topic branches, you should always use the `--rebase` flag to `git pull`, or if you are usually handling many temporary &quot;to be in a github pull request&quot; branches, run the following to automate this:

```bash
git config branch.autosetuprebase local
```

(see `man git-config` for more information)

### Handling merge conflicts

If you&#039;re getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature
`git mergetool`. Even though the default tool `xxdiff` looks awful/old, it&#039;s rather useful.

The following are some commands that can be used there:

- `Ctrl + Alt + M` - automerge as much as possible
- `b` - jump to next merge conflict
- `s` - change the order of the conflicted lines
- `u` - undo a merge
- `left mouse button` - mark a block to be the winner
- `middle mouse button` - mark a line to be the winner
- `Ctrl + S` - save
- `Ctrl + Q` - quit

## [QUnit](https://api.qunitjs.com) Reference

### Test methods

```js
expect( numAssertions );
stop();
start();
```

*Note*: QUnit&#039;s eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.

### Test assertions

```js
ok( value, [message] );
equal( actual, expected, [message] );
notEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
deepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
strictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
throws( block, [expected], [message] );
```

## Test Suite Convenience Methods Reference

See [test/data/testinit.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/test/data/testinit.js).

### Returns an array of elements with the given IDs

```js
q( ... );
```

Example:

```js
q( &quot;main&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; );

=&gt; [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]
```

### Asserts that a selection matches the given IDs

```js
t( testName, selector, [ &quot;array&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;ids&quot; ] );
```

Example:

```js
t(&quot;Check for something&quot;, &quot;//[a]&quot;, [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]);
```

### Fires a native DOM event without going through jQuery

```js
fireNative( node, eventType );
```

Example:

```js
fireNative( jQuery( &quot;#elem&quot; )[ 0 ], &quot;click&quot; );
```

### Add random number to url to stop caching

```js
url( &quot;some/url&quot; );
```

Example:

```js
url( &quot;index.html&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/index.html?10538358428943&quot;


url( &quot;mock.php?foo=bar&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/mock.php?foo=bar&amp;10538358345554&quot;
```

### Run tests in an iframe

Some tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and
these can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions
remain in jQuery&#039;s main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup
and setup code should be placed in the iframe file.

```js
testIframe( testName, fileName,
  function testCallback(
      assert, jQuery, window, document,
	  [ additional args ] ) {
	...
  } );
```

This loads a page, constructing a url with fileName `&quot;./data/&quot; + fileName`.
The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by
including the &quot;/test/data/iframeTest.js&quot; script and calling
`startIframeTest( [ additional args ] )` when appropriate. Often this
will be after either document ready or `window.onload` fires.

The `testCallback` receives the QUnit `assert` object created by `testIframe`
for this test, followed by the global `jQuery`, `window`, and `document` from
the iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to `startIframeTest`,
they follow the `document` argument.

- Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a **WebSocket**. 
- Not running Selenium or Chromium saves you like **half a gig** of ram :/ 
- Baileys supports interacting with the multi-device &amp; web versions of WhatsApp.
- Thank you to [@pokearaujo](https://github.com/pokearaujo/multidevice) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Multi-Device. Also, thank you to [@Sigalor](https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Web and thanks to [@Rhymen](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/) for the __go__ implementation.

## Connecting Account

WhatsApp provides a multi-device API that allows Baileys to be authenticated as a second WhatsApp client by scanning a **QR code** or **Pairing Code** with WhatsApp on your phone.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **[Here](#example-to-start) is a simple example of event handling**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **You can see all supported socket configs [here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/SocketConfig.html) (Recommended)**

### Starting socket with **QR-CODE**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can customize browser name if you connect with **QR-CODE**, with `Browser` constant, we have some browsers config, **see [here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/BrowsersMap.html)**

```ts
import makeWASocket from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    browser: Browsers.ubuntu(&#039;My App&#039;),
    printQRInTerminal: true
})
```

If the connection is successful, you will see a QR code printed on your terminal screen, scan it with WhatsApp on your phone and you&#039;ll be logged in!

### Starting socket with **Pairing Code**


&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Pairing Code isn&#039;t Mobile API, it&#039;s a method to connect Whatsapp Web without QR-CODE, you can connect only with one device, see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1324084875126592/?cms_platform=web)

The phone number can&#039;t have `+` or `()` or `-`, only numbers, you must provide country code

```ts
import makeWASocket from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    printQRInTerminal: false //need to be false
})

if (!sock.authState.creds.registered) {
    const number = &#039;XXXXXXXXXXX&#039;
    const code = await sock.requestPairingCode(number)
    console.log(code)
}
```

### Receive Full History

1. Set `syncFullHistory` as `true`
2. Baileys, by default, use chrome browser config
    - If you&#039;d like to emulate a desktop connection (and receive more message history), this browser setting to your Socket config:

```ts
const sock = makeWASocket({
    ...otherOpts,
    // can use Windows, Ubuntu here too
    browser: Browsers.macOS(&#039;Desktop&#039;),
    syncFullHistory: true
})
```

## Important Notes About Socket Config

### Caching Group Metadata (Recommended)
- If you use baileys for groups, we recommend you to set `cachedGroupMetadata` in socket config, you need to implement a cache like this:

    ```ts
    const groupCache = new NodeCache({stdTTL: 5 * 60, useClones: false})

    const sock = makeWASocket({
        cachedGroupMetadata: async (jid) =&gt; groupCache.get(jid)
    })

    sock.ev.on(&#039;groups.update&#039;, async ([event]) =&gt; {
        const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
        groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
    })

    sock.ev.on(&#039;group-participants.update&#039;, async (event) =&gt; {
        const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
        groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
    })
    ```

### Improve Retry System &amp; Decrypt Poll Votes
- If you want to improve sending message, retrying when error occurs and decrypt poll votes, you need to have a store and set `getMessage` config in socket like this:
    ```ts
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        getMessage: async (key) =&gt; await getMessageFromStore(key)
    })
    ```

### Receive Notifications in Whatsapp App
- If you want to receive notifications in whatsapp app, set `markOnlineOnConnect` to `false`
    ```ts
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        markOnlineOnConnect: false
    })
    ```
## Saving &amp; Restoring Sessions

You obviously don&#039;t want to keep scanning the QR code every time you want to connect. 

So, you can load the credentials to log back in:
```ts
import makeWASocket, { useMultiFileAuthState } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState(&#039;auth_info_baileys&#039;)

// will use the given state to connect
// so if valid credentials are available -- it&#039;ll connect without QR
const sock = makeWASocket({ auth: state })

// this will be called as soon as the credentials are updated
sock.ev.on(&#039;creds.update&#039;, saveCreds)
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; `useMultiFileAuthState` is a utility function to help save the auth state in a single folder, this function serves as a good guide to help write auth &amp; key states for SQL/no-SQL databases, which I would recommend in any production grade system.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; When a message is received/sent, due to signal sessions needing updating, the auth keys (`authState.keys`) will update. Whenever that happens, you must save the updated keys (`authState.keys.set()` is called). Not doing so will prevent your messages from reaching the recipient &amp; cause other unexpected consequences. The `useMultiFileAuthState` function automatically takes care of that, but for any other serious implementation -- you will need to be very careful with the key state management.

## Handling Events

- Baileys uses the EventEmitter syntax for events. 
They&#039;re all nicely typed up, so you shouldn&#039;t have any issues with an Intellisense editor like VS Code.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **The events are [these](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/BaileysEventMap.html)**, it&#039;s important you see all events

You can listen to these events like this:
```ts
const sock = makeWASocket()
sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.upsert&#039;, ({ messages }) =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;got messages&#039;, messages)
})
```

### Example to Start

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This example includes basic auth storage too

```ts
import makeWASocket, { DisconnectReason, useMultiFileAuthState } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;
import { Boom } from &#039;@hapi/boom&#039;

async function connectToWhatsApp () {
    const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState(&#039;auth_info_baileys&#039;)
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        // can provide additional config here
        auth: state,
        printQRInTerminal: true
    })
    sock.ev.on(&#039;connection.update&#039;, (update) =&gt; {
        const { connection, lastDisconnect } = update
        if(connection === &#039;close&#039;) {
            const shouldReconnect = (lastDisconnect.error as Boom)?.output?.statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut
            console.log(&#039;connection closed due to &#039;, lastDisconnect.error, &#039;, reconnecting &#039;, shouldReconnect)
            // reconnect if not logged out
            if(shouldReconnect) {
                connectToWhatsApp()
            }
        } else if(connection === &#039;open&#039;) {
            console.log(&#039;opened connection&#039;)
        }
    })
    sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.upsert&#039;, event =&gt; {
        for (const m of event.messages) {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(m, undefined, 2))

            console.log(&#039;replying to&#039;, m.key.remoteJid)
            await sock.sendMessage(m.key.remoteJid!, { text: &#039;Hello Word&#039; })
        }
    })

    // to storage creds (session info) when it updates
    sock.ev.on(&#039;creds.update&#039;, saveCreds)
}
// run in main file
connectToWhatsApp()
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; In `messages.upsert` it&#039;s recommended to use a loop like `for (const message of event.messages)` to handle all messages in array

### Decrypt Poll Votes

- By default poll votes are encrypted and handled in `messages.update`
- That&#039;s a simple example
```ts
sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.update&#039;, event =&gt; {
    for(const { key, update } of event) {
        if(update.pollUpdates) {
            const pollCreation = await getMessage(key)
            if(pollCreation) {
                console.log(
                    &#039;got poll update, aggregation: &#039;,
                    getAggregateVotesInPollMessage({
                        message: pollCreation,
                        pollUpdates: update.pollUpdates,
                    })
                )
            }
        }
    }
})
```

- `getMessage` is a [store](#implementing-a-data-store) implementation (in your end)

### Summary of Events on First Connection

1. When you connect first time, `connection.update` will be fired requesting you to restart sock
2. Then, history messages will be received in `messaging.history-set`

## Implementing a Data Store

- Baileys does not come with a defacto storage for chats, contacts, or messages. However, a simple in-memory implementation has been provided. The store listens for chat updates, new messages, message updates, etc., to always have an up-to-date version of the data.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; I highly recommend building your own data store, as storing someone&#039;s entire chat history in memory is a terrible waste of RAM.

It can be used as follows:

```ts
import makeWASocket, { makeInMemoryStore } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;
// the store maintains the data of the WA connection in memory
// can be written out to a file &amp; read from it
const store = makeInMemoryStore({ })
// can be read from a file
store.readFromFile(&#039;./baileys_store.json&#039;)
// saves the state to a file every 10s
setInterval(() =&gt; {
    store.writeToFile(&#039;./baileys_store.json&#039;)
}, 10_000)

const sock = makeWASocket({ })
// will listen from this socket
// the store can listen from a new socket once the current socket outlives its lifetime
store.bind(sock.ev)

sock.ev.on(&#039;chats.upsert&#039;, () =&gt; {
    // can use &#039;store.chats&#039; however you want, even after the socket dies out
    // &#039;chats&#039; =&gt; a KeyedDB instance
    console.log(&#039;got chats&#039;, store.chats.all())
})

sock.ev.on(&#039;contacts.upsert&#039;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;got contacts&#039;, Object.values(store.contacts))
})

```

The store also provides some simple functions such as `loadMessages` that utilize the store to speed up data retrieval.

## Whatsapp IDs Explain

- `id` is the WhatsApp ID, called `jid` too, of the person or group you&#039;re sending the message to. 
    - It must be in the format ```[country code][phone number]@s.whatsapp.net```
	    - Example for people: ```+19999999999@s.whatsapp.net```. 
	    - For groups, it must be in the format ``` 123456789-123345@g.us ```. 
    - For broadcast lists, it&#039;s `[timestamp of creation]@broadcast`.
    - For stories, the ID is `status@broadcast`.

## Utility Functions

- `getContentType`, returns the content type for any message
- `getDevice`, returns the device from message
- `makeCacheableSignalKeyStore`, make auth store more fast
- `downloadContentFromMessage`, download content from any message

## Sending Messages

- Send all types of messages with a single function
    - **[Here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/AnyMessageContent.html) you can see all message contents supported, like text message**
    - **[Here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/MiscMessageGenerationOptions.html) you can see all options supported, like quote message**

    ```ts
    const jid: string
    const content: AnyMessageContent
    const options: MiscMessageGenerationOptions

    sock.sendMessage(jid, content, options)
    ```

### Non-Media Messages

#### Text Message
```ts
await sock.sendMessage(jid, { text: &#039;hello word&#039; })
```

#### Quote Message (works with all types)
```ts
await sock.sendMessage(jid, { text: &#039;hello word&#039; }, { quoted: message })
```

## Installation

First install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads). Then:

```sh
npm install mongoose
```

Mongoose 6.8.0 also includes alpha support for [Deno](https://deno.land/).

## Importing

```javascript
// Using Node.js `require()`
const mongoose = require(&#039;mongoose&#039;);

// Using ES6 imports
import mongoose from &#039;mongoose&#039;;
```

Or, using [Deno&#039;s `createRequire()` for CommonJS support](https://deno.land/std@0.113.0/node/README.md?source=#commonjs-modules-loading) as follows.

```javascript
import { createRequire } from &#039;https://deno.land/std@0.177.0/node/module.ts&#039;;
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

const mongoose = require(&#039;mongoose&#039;);

mongoose.connect(&#039;mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test&#039;)
  .then(() =&gt; console.log(&#039;Connected!&#039;));
```

You can then run the above script using the following.

```sh
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-sys --allow-env mongoose-test.js
```

## Overview

### Connecting to MongoDB

First, we need to define a connection. If your app uses only one database, you should use `mongoose.connect`. If you need to create additional connections, use `mongoose.createConnection`.

Both `connect` and `createConnection` take a `mongodb://` URI, or the parameters `host, database, port, options`.

```js
await mongoose.connect(&#039;mongodb://127.0.0.1/my_database&#039;);
```

Once connected, the `open` event is fired on the `Connection` instance. If you&#039;re using `mongoose.connect`, the `Connection` is `mongoose.connection`. Otherwise, `mongoose.createConnection` return value is a `Connection`.

**Note:** *If the local connection fails then try using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. Sometimes issues may arise when the local hostname has been changed.*

**Important!** Mongoose buffers all the commands until it&#039;s connected to the database. This means that you don&#039;t have to wait until it connects to MongoDB in order to define models, run queries, etc.

### Defining a Model

Models are defined through the `Schema` interface.

```js
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const ObjectId = Schema.ObjectId;

const BlogPost = new Schema({
  author: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  body: String,
  date: Date
});
```

Aside from defining the structure of your documents and the types of data you&#039;re storing, a Schema handles the definition of:

* [Validators](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html) (async and sync)
* [Defaults](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/schematype.html#schematype_SchemaType-default)
* [Getters](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/schematype.html#schematype_SchemaType-get)
* [Setters](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/schematype.html#schematype_SchemaType-set)
* [Indexes](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#indexes)
* [Middleware](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html)
* [Methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods) definition
* [Statics](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics) definition
* [Plugins](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/plugins.html)
* [pseudo-JOINs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html)

The following example shows some of these features:

```js
const Comment = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, default: &#039;hahaha&#039; },
  age: { type: Number, min: 18, index: true },
  bio: { type: String, match: /[a-z]/ },
  date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  buff: Buffer
});

// a setter
Comment.path(&#039;name&#039;).set(function(v) {
  return capitalize(v);
});

// middleware
Comment.pre(&#039;save&#039;, function(next) {
  notify(this.get(&#039;email&#039;));
  next();
});
```

Take a look at the example in [`examples/schema/schema.js`](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/examples/schema/schema.js) for an end-to-end example of a typical setup.

### Accessing a Model

Once we define a model through `mongoose.model(&#039;ModelName&#039;, mySchema)`, we can access it through the same function

```js
const MyModel = mongoose.model(&#039;ModelName&#039;);
```

Or just do it all at once

```js
const MyModel = mongoose.model(&#039;ModelName&#039;, mySchema);
```

The first argument is the *singular* name of the collection your model is for. **Mongoose automatically looks for the *plural* version of your model name.** For example, if you use

```js
const MyModel = mongoose.model(&#039;Ticket&#039;, mySchema);
```

Then `MyModel` will use the **tickets** collection, not the **ticket** collection. For more details read the [model docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/mongoose.html#mongoose_Mongoose-model).

Once we have our model, we can then instantiate it, and save it:

```js
const instance = new MyModel();
instance.my.key = &#039;hello&#039;;
await instance.save();
```

Or we can find documents from the same collection

```js
await MyModel.find({});
```

You can also `findOne`, `findById`, `update`, etc.

```js
const instance = await MyModel.findOne({ /* ... */ });
console.log(instance.my.key); // &#039;hello&#039;
```

For more details check out [the docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html).

**Important!** If you opened a separate connection using `mongoose.createConnection()` but attempt to access the model through `mongoose.model(&#039;ModelName&#039;)` it will not work as expected since it is not hooked up to an active db connection. In this case access your model through the connection you created:

```js
const conn = mongoose.createConnection(&#039;your connection string&#039;);
const MyModel = conn.model(&#039;ModelName&#039;, schema);
const m = new MyModel();
await m.save(); // works
```

vs

```js
const conn = mongoose.createConnection(&#039;your connection string&#039;);
const MyModel = mongoose.model(&#039;ModelName&#039;, schema);
const m = new MyModel();
await m.save(); // does not work b/c the default connection object was never connected
```

### Embedded Documents

In the first example snippet, we defined a key in the Schema that looks like:

```txt
comments: [Comment]
```

Where `Comment` is a `Schema` we created. This means that creating embedded documents is as simple as:

```js
// retrieve my model
const BlogPost = mongoose.model(&#039;BlogPost&#039;);

// create a blog post
const post = new BlogPost();

// create a comment
post.comments.push({ title: &#039;My comment&#039; });

await post.save();
```

The same goes for removing them:

```js
const post = await BlogPost.findById(myId);
post.comments[0].deleteOne();
await post.save();
```

Embedded documents enjoy all the same features as your models. Defaults, validators, middleware.

### Middleware

See the [docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html) page.

#### Intercepting and mutating method arguments

You can intercept method arguments via middleware.

For example, this would allow you to broadcast changes about your Documents every time someone `set`s a path in your Document to a new value:

```js
schema.pre(&#039;set&#039;, function(next, path, val, typel) {
  // `this` is the current Document
  this.emit(&#039;set&#039;, path, val);

  // Pass control to the next pre
  next();
});
```

Moreover, you can mutate the incoming `method` arguments so that subsequent middleware see different values for those arguments. To do so, just pass the new values to `next`:

```js
schema.pre(method, function firstPre(next, methodArg1, methodArg2) {
  // Mutate methodArg1
  next(&#039;altered-&#039; + methodArg1.toString(), methodArg2);
});

// pre declaration is chainable
schema.pre(method, function secondPre(next, methodArg1, methodArg2) {
  console.log(methodArg1);
  // =&gt; &#039;altered-originalValOfMethodArg1&#039;

  console.log(methodArg2);
  // =&gt; &#039;originalValOfMethodArg2&#039;

  // Passing no arguments to `next` automatically passes along the current argument values
  // i.e., the following `next()` is equivalent to `next(methodArg1, methodArg2)`
  // and also equivalent to, with the example method arg
  // values, `next(&#039;altered-originalValOfMethodArg1&#039;, &#039;originalValOfMethodArg2&#039;)`
  next();
});
```

#### Schema gotcha

`type`, when used in a schema has special meaning within Mongoose. If your schema requires using `type` as a nested property you must use object notation:

```js
new Schema({
  broken: { type: Boolean },
  asset: {
    name: String,
    type: String // uh oh, it broke. asset will be interpreted as String
  }
});

new Schema({
  works: { type: Boolean },
  asset: {
    name: String,
    type: { type: String } // works. asset is an object with a type property
  }
});
```

### Driver Access

Mongoose is built on top of the [official MongoDB Node.js driver](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native). Each mongoose model keeps a reference to a [native MongoDB driver collection](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.1/api/Collection.html). The collection object can be accessed using `YourModel.collection`. However, using the collection object directly bypasses all mongoose features, including hooks, validation, etc. The one
notable exception that `YourModel.collection` still buffers
commands. As such, `YourModel.collection.find()` will **not**
return a cursor.

Heavily inspired from the [TRON Legacy movie effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671) (especially the [Board Room sequence](https://gmunk.com/TRON-Board-Room)), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be *&quot;[DEX-UI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui) with less ¬´ art ¬ª and more ¬´ distributable software ¬ª&quot;*.

While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.

&lt;br&gt;

It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.

## Q&amp;A
#### How do I get it?
Click on the little badges under the eDEX logo at the top of this page, or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases) tab, or download it through [one of the available repositories](https://repology.org/project/edex-ui/versions) (Homebrew, AUR...).

Public release binaries are unsigned ([why](https://gaby.dev/posts/code-signing)). On Linux, you will need to `chmod +x` the AppImage file in order to run it.
#### I have a problem!
Search through the [Issues](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues) to see if yours has already been reported. If you&#039;re confident it hasn&#039;t been reported yet, feel free to open up a new one. If you see your issue and it&#039;s been closed, it probably means that the fix for it will ship in the next version, and you&#039;ll have to wait a bit.
#### Can you disable the keyboard/the filesystem display?
You can&#039;t disable them (yet) but you can hide them. See the `tron-notype` theme.
#### Why is the file browser saying that &quot;Tracking Failed&quot;? (Windows only)
On Linux and macOS, eDEX tracks where you&#039;re going in your terminal tab to display the content of the current folder on-screen.
Sadly, this is technically impossible to do on Windows right now, so the file browser reverts back to a &quot;detached&quot; mode. You can still use it to browse files &amp; directories and click on files to input their path in the terminal.
#### Can this run on a Raspberry Pi / ARM device?
We provide prebuilt arm64 builds. For other platforms, see [this issue comment](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/313#issuecomment-443465345), and the thread on issue [#818](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/818).
#### Is this repo actively maintained?
No, after a 3 years run, this project has been archived. See the [announcement](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases/tag/v2.2.8).
#### How did you make this?
Glad you&#039;re interested! See [#272](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/272).
#### This is so cool.
Thanks! If you feel like it, you can [follow me on Twitter](https://gaby.dev/twitter) to hear about new stuff I&#039;m making.

## Useful commands for the nerds

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the following instructions are meant for running eDEX from the latest unoptimized, unreleased, development version. If you&#039;d like to get stable software instead, refer to [these](#how-do-i-get-it) instructions.

#### Starting from source:
on *nix systems (You&#039;ll need the Xcode command line tools on macOS):
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-linux`
- `npm run start`

on Windows:
- start cmd or powershell **as administrator**
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-windows`
- `npm run start`

#### Building
Note: Due to native modules, you can only build targets for the host OS you are using.

- `npm install` (NOT `install-linux` or `install-windows`)
- `npm run build-linux` or `build-windows` or `build-darwin`

The script will minify the source code, recompile native dependencies and create distributable assets in the `dist` folder.

#### Getting the bleeding edge
If you&#039;re interested in running the latest in-development version but don&#039;t want to compile source code yourself, you can can get pre-built nightly binaries on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/actions): click the latest commits, and download the artifacts bundle for your OS.

## Credits
eDEX-UI&#039;s source code was primarily written by me, [Squared](https://github.com/GitSquared). If you want to get in touch with me or find other projects I&#039;m involved in, check out [my website](https://gaby.dev).

[PixelyIon](https://github.com/PixelyIon) helped me get started with Windows compatibility and offered some precious advice when I started to work on this project seriously.

[IceWolf](https://soundcloud.com/iamicewolf) composed the sound effects on v2.1.x and above. He makes really cool stuff, check out his music!

## Thanks
Of course, eDEX would never have existed if I hadn&#039;t stumbled upon the amazing work of [Seena](https://github.com/seenaburns) on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

This project uses a bunch of open-source libraries, frameworks and tools, see [the full dependency graph](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/network/dependencies).

I want to namely thank the developers behind [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) and [SmoothieCharts](https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie).

Huge thanks to [Rob &quot;Arscan&quot; Scanlon](https://github.com/arscan) for making the fantastic [ENCOM Globe](https://github.com/arscan/encom-globe), also inspired by the TRON: Legacy movie, and distributing it freely. His work really puts the icing on the cake.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; ‚ÑπÔ∏è **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected
&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.
