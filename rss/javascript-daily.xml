## Mission

**The world is rushing to build AI systems. It is not engineering them.**

That gap is what we mean by AI engineering.

**AI engineering is the discipline of building efficient, reliable, safe, and robust intelligent systems that operate in the real world, not just models in isolation.**

**Our mission:** Establish AI engineering as a foundational discipline, alongside software engineering and computer engineering, by teaching how to design, build, and evaluate end to end intelligent systems. The long term impact of AI will be shaped by engineers who can turn ideas into working, dependable systems.

---

## What’s in this repo

This repository is the open learning stack for AI systems engineering.

It includes the textbook source, TinyTorch, hardware kits, and upcoming co-labs that connect principles to runnable code and real devices.

## What Makes This Different

This is a living textbook. We keep it updated as the field grows, with community input along the way.

AI may feel like it is moving at lightning speed, but the engineering building blocks that make it work do not change as quickly as the headlines. This project is built around those stable foundations.

Think of it like LEGO. New sets arrive all the time, but the bricks themselves stay the same. Once you learn how the bricks fit together, you can build anything. Here, those &quot;AI bricks&quot; are the solid systems principles that make AI work.

Whether you are reading a chapter, running a lab, or sharing feedback, you are helping make these ideas more accessible to the next learner.

### Research to Teaching Loop

We use the same loop for research and teaching: define the system problem, build a reference implementation, benchmark it, then turn it into curriculum and tooling so others can reproduce and extend it.

| Loop Step | Research Artifacts | Teaching Artifacts |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Measure** | Benchmarks, suites, metrics | Benchmarking chapter, assignments |
| **Build** | Reference systems, compilers, runtimes | TinyTorch modules, co-labs |
| **Deploy** | Hardware targets, constraints, reliability | Hardware labs, kits |

## Support This Work

We are working toward **1 million learners by 2030** so that AI engineering becomes a shared, teachable discipline, not a collection of isolated practices. Every star, share, and contribution helps move this effort forward.

### Why GitHub Stars Matter

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

*What gets measured gets improved.*

Each star is a learner, educator, or supporter who believes AI systems should be engineered with rigor and real world constraints in mind.

[![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/harvard-edge/cs249r_book?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;color=gold)](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/stargazers)

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;Date)

1 learner → 10 learners → 100 learners → 1,000 learners → **10,000 learners** → 100,000 learners → **1M learners**

&lt;/div&gt;

Stars are not the goal. They are a signal.

A visible, growing community makes it easier for universities, foundations, and industry partners to adopt this material, donate hardware, and fund workshops. That momentum lowers the barrier for the next institution, the next classroom, and the next cohort of learners.

Support raised through this signal flows into [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook) and funds concrete outcomes such as TinyML4D workshops, hardware kits for underserved classrooms, and the infrastructure required to keep this resource free and open.

One click can unlock the next classroom, the next contributor, and the next generation of AI engineers.

### Fund the Mission

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

All contributions go to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook), a transparent fund that supports educational outreach.

Fundado em Desenvolvimento Ágil Dirigido por Agentes, oferecendo capacidades revolucionárias para desenvolvimento dirigido por IA e muito mais. Transforme qualquer domínio com expertise especializada de IA: desenvolvimento de software, entretenimento, escrita criativa, estratégia de negócios, bem-estar pessoal e muito mais.

## Comece Aqui (10 Min)

Se é sua primeira vez no AIOS, siga este caminho linear:

1. Instale em um projeto novo ou existente:
```bash
# novo projeto
npx aios-core init meu-projeto

# projeto existente
cd seu-projeto
npx aios-core install
```
2. Escolha sua IDE/CLI e o caminho de ativação:
- Claude Code: `/agent-name`
- Gemini CLI: `/aios-menu` → `/aios-&lt;agent&gt;`
- Codex CLI: `/skills` → `aios-&lt;agent-id&gt;`
- Cursor/Copilot/AntiGravity: siga os limites e workarounds em `docs/ide-integration.md`
3. Ative 1 agente e confirme o greeting.
4. Rode 1 comando inicial (`*help` ou equivalente) para validar first-value.

Definição de first-value (binária): ativação de agente + greeting válido + comando inicial com output útil em &lt;= 10 minutos.


## Compatibilidade de Hooks por IDE (Realidade AIOS 4.2)

Muitos recursos avançados do AIOS dependem de eventos de ciclo de vida (hooks). A tabela abaixo mostra a paridade real entre IDEs/plataformas:

| IDE/CLI | Paridade de Hooks vs Claude | Impacto Prático |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Completa (referência) | Automação máxima de contexto, guardrails e auditoria |
| Gemini CLI | Alta (eventos nativos) | Cobertura forte de automações pre/post tool e sessão |
| Codex CLI | Parcial/limitada | Parte das automações depende de `AGENTS.md`, `/skills`, MCP e fluxo operacional |
| Cursor | Sem lifecycle hooks equivalentes | Menor automação de pre/post tool; foco em regras, MCP e fluxo do agente |
| GitHub Copilot | Sem lifecycle hooks equivalentes | Menor automação de sessão/tooling; foco em instruções de repositório + MCP no VS Code |
| AntiGravity | Workflow-based (não hook-based) | Integração por workflows, não por eventos de hook equivalentes ao Claude |

Impactos e mitigação detalhados: `docs/ide-integration.md`.

## Visão Geral

### Premissa Arquitetural: CLI First

O Synkra AIOS segue uma hierarquia clara de prioridades:

```
CLI First → Observability Second → UI Third
```

| Camada            | Prioridade | Foco                                                                          | Exemplos                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **CLI**           | Máxima     | Onde a inteligência vive. Toda execução, decisões e automação acontecem aqui. | Agentes (`@dev`, `@qa`), workflows, comandos |
| **Observability** | Secundária | Observar e monitorar o que acontece no CLI em tempo real.                     | Dashboard SSE, logs, métricas, timeline      |
| **UI**            | Terciária  | Gestão pontual e visualizações quando necessário.                             | Kanban, settings, story management           |

**Princípios derivados:**

- A CLI é a fonte da verdade - dashboards apenas observam
- Funcionalidades novas devem funcionar 100% via CLI antes de ter UI
- A UI nunca deve ser requisito para operação do sistema
- Observabilidade serve para entender o que o CLI está fazendo, não para controlá-lo

**As Duas Inovações Chave do Synkra AIOS:**

**1. Planejamento Agêntico:** Agentes dedicados (analyst, pm, architect) colaboram com você para criar documentos de PRD e Arquitetura detalhados e consistentes. Através de engenharia avançada de prompts e refinamento com human-in-the-loop, estes agentes de planejamento produzem especificações abrangentes que vão muito além da geração genérica de tarefas de IA.

**2. Desenvolvimento Contextualizado por Engenharia:** O agente sm (Scrum Master) então transforma estes planos detalhados em histórias de desenvolvimento hiperdetalhadas que contêm tudo que o agente dev precisa - contexto completo, detalhes de implementação e orientação arquitetural incorporada diretamente nos arquivos de histórias.

Esta abordagem de duas fases elimina tanto a **inconsistência de planejamento** quanto a **perda de contexto** - os maiores problemas no desenvolvimento assistido por IA. Seu agente dev abre um arquivo de história com compreensão completa do que construir, como construir e por quê.

**📖 [Veja o fluxo de trabalho completo no Guia do Usuário](docs/guides/user-guide.md)** - Fase de planejamento, ciclo de desenvolvimento e todos os papéis dos agentes

## Pré-requisitos

- Node.js &gt;=18.0.0 (v20+ recomendado)
- npm &gt;=9.0.0
- GitHub CLI (opcional, necessário para colaboração em equipe)

&gt; **Problemas de instalação?** Consulte o [Guia de Troubleshooting](docs/guides/installation-troubleshooting.md)

**Guias específicos por plataforma:**

- 📖 [Guia de Instalação para macOS](docs/installation/macos.md)
- 📖 [Guia de Instalação para Windows](docs/installation/windows.md)
- 📖 [Guia de Instalação para Linux](docs/installation/linux.md)

**Documentação multilíngue disponível:** [Português](docs/pt/installation/) | [Español](docs/es/installation/)

## Navegação Rápida

### Entendendo o Fluxo de Trabalho AIOS

**Antes de mergulhar, revise estes diagramas críticos de fluxo de trabalho que explicam como o AIOS funciona:**

1. **[Fluxo de Planejamento (Interface Web)](docs/guides/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui)** - Como criar documentos de PRD e Arquitetura
2. **[Ciclo Principal de Desenvolvimento (IDE)](docs/guides/user-guide.md#the-core-development-cycle-ide)** - Como os agentes sm, dev e qa colaboram através de arquivos de histórias

&gt; ⚠️ **Estes diagramas explicam 90% da confusão sobre o fluxo Synkra AIOS Agentic Agile** - Entender a criação de PRD+Arquitetura e o fluxo de trabalho sm/dev/qa e como os agentes passam notas através de arquivos de histórias é essencial - e também explica por que isto NÃO é taskmaster ou apenas um simples executor de tarefas!

## Why I Built This

I&#039;m a solo developer. I don&#039;t write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you&#039;re building. I&#039;m not a 50-person software company. I don&#039;t want to play enterprise theater. I&#039;m just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work *and* verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That&#039;s what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.

— **TÂCHES**

---

Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It&#039;s the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.

---

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they&#039;re running a 50-person engineering org.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

The installer prompts you to choose:
1. **Runtime** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, or all
2. **Location** — Global (all projects) or local (current project only)

Verify with `/gsd:help` inside your chosen runtime.

### Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# Claude Code
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --global   # Install to ~/.claude/
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local    # Install to ./.claude/

# OpenCode (open source, free models)
npx get-shit-done-cc --opencode --global # Install to ~/.config/opencode/

# Gemini CLI
npx get-shit-done-cc --gemini --global   # Install to ~/.gemini/

# All runtimes
npx get-shit-done-cc --all --global      # Install to all directories
```

Use `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the location prompt.
Use `--claude`, `--opencode`, `--gemini`, or `--all` to skip the runtime prompt.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Clone the repository and run the installer locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done.git
cd get-shit-done
node bin/install.js --claude --local
```

Installs to `./.claude/` for testing modifications before contributing.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Recommended: Skip Permissions Mode

GSD is designed for frictionless automation. Run Claude Code with:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; This is how GSD is intended to be used — stopping to approve `date` and `git commit` 50 times defeats the purpose.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative: Granular Permissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

If you prefer not to use that flag, add this to your project&#039;s `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allow&quot;: [
      &quot;Bash(date:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(echo:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(cat:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(ls:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(mkdir:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(wc:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(head:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(tail:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(sort:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(grep:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(tr:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git add:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git commit:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git status:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git log:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git diff:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git tag:*)&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## How It Works

&gt; **Already have code?** Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first. It spawns parallel agents to analyze your stack, architecture, conventions, and concerns. Then `/gsd:new-project` knows your codebase — questions focus on what you&#039;re adding, and planning automatically loads your patterns.

### 1. Initialize Project

```
/gsd:new-project
```

One command, one flow. The system:

1. **Questions** — Asks until it understands your idea completely (goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases)
2. **Research** — Spawns parallel agents to investigate the domain (optional but recommended)
3. **Requirements** — Extracts what&#039;s v1, v2, and out of scope
4. **Roadmap** — Creates phases mapped to requirements

You approve the roadmap. Now you&#039;re ready to build.

**Creates:** `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, `.planning/research/`

---

### 2. Discuss Phase

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 1
```

**This is where you shape the implementation.**

Your roadmap has a sentence or two per phase. That&#039;s not enough context to build something the way *you* imagine it. This step captures your preferences before anything gets researched or planned.

The system analyzes the phase and identifies gray areas based on what&#039;s being built:

- **Visual features** → Layout, density, interactions, empty states
- **APIs/CLIs** → Response format, flags, error handling, verbosity
- **Content systems** → Structure, tone, depth, flow
- **Organization tasks** → Grouping criteria, naming, duplicates, exceptions

For each area you select, it asks until you&#039;re satisfied. The output — `CONTEXT.md` — feeds directly into the next two steps:

1. **Researcher reads it** — Knows what patterns to investigate (&quot;user wants card layout&quot; → research card component libraries)
2. **Planner reads it** — Knows what decisions are locked (&quot;infinite scroll decided&quot; → plan includes scroll handling)

The deeper you go here, the more the system builds what you actually want. Skip it and you get reasonable defaults. Use it and you get *your* vision.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md`

---

### 3. Plan Phase

```
/gsd:plan-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Researches** — Investigates how to implement this phase, guided by your CONTEXT.md decisions
2. **Plans** — Creates 2-3 atomic task plans with XML structure
3. **Verifies** — Checks plans against requirements, loops until they pass

Each plan is small enough to execute in a fresh context window. No degradation, no &quot;I&#039;ll be more concise now.&quot;

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-RESEARCH.md`, `{phase_num}-{N}-PLAN.md`

---

### 4. Execute Phase

```
/gsd:execute-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Runs plans in waves** — Parallel where possible, sequential when dependent
2. **Fresh context per plan** — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage
3. **Commits per task** — Every task gets its own atomic commit
4. **Verifies against goals** — Checks the codebase delivers what the phase promised

Walk away, come back to completed work with clean git history.

**How Wave Execution Works:**

Plans are grouped into &quot;waves&quot; based on dependencies. Within each wave, plans run in parallel. Waves run sequentially.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE EXECUTION                                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                      │
│  WAVE 1 (parallel)          WAVE 2 (parallel)          WAVE 3       │
│  ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ │
│  │ Plan 01 │ │ Plan 02 │ →  │ Plan 03 │ │ Plan 04 │ →  │ Plan 05 │ │
│  │         │ │         │    │         │ │         │    │         │ │
│  │ User    │ │ Product │    │ Orders  │ │ Cart    │    │ Checkout│ │
│  │ Model   │ │ Model   │    │ API     │ │ API     │    │ UI      │ │
│  └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ │
│       │           │              ↑           ↑              ↑       │
│       └───────────┴──────────────┴───────────┘              │       │
│              Dependencies: Plan 03 needs Plan 01            │       │
│                          Plan 04 needs Plan 02              │       │
│                          Plan 05 needs Plans 03 + 04        │       │
│                                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why waves matter:**
- Independent plans → Same wave → Run in parallel
- Dependent plans → Later wave → Wait for dependencies
- File conflicts → Sequential plans or same plan

This is why &quot;vertical slices&quot; (Plan 01: User feature end-to-end) parallelize better than &quot;horizontal layers&quot; (Plan 01: All models, Plan 02: All APIs).

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-{N}-SUMMARY.md`, `{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md`

---

### 5. Verify Work

```
/gsd:verify-work 1
```

**This is where you confirm it actually works.**

Automated verification checks that code exists and tests pass. But does the feature *work* the way you expected? This is your chance to use it.

The system:

1. **Extracts testable deliverables** — What you should be able to do now
2. **Walks you through one at a time** — &quot;Can you log in with email?&quot; Yes/no, or describe what&#039;s wrong
3. **Diagnoses failures automatically** — Spawns debug agents to find root causes
4. **Creates verified fix plans** — Ready for immediate re-execution

If everything passes, you move on. If something&#039;s broken, you don&#039;t manually debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again with the fix plans it created.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-UAT.md`, fix plans if issues found

---

### 6. Repeat → Complete → Next Milestone

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 2
/gsd:plan-phase 2
/gsd:execute-phase 2
/gsd:verify-work 2
...
/gsd:complete-milestone
/gsd:new-milestone
```

Loop **discuss → plan → execute → verify** until milestone complete.

Each phase gets your input (discuss), proper research (plan), clean execution (execute), and human verification (verify). Context stays fresh. Quality stays high.

When all phases are done, `/gsd:complete-milestone` archives the milestone and tags the release.

Then `/gsd:new-milestone` starts the next version — same flow as `new-project` but for your existing codebase. You describe what you want to build next, the system researches the domain, you scope requirements, and it creates a fresh roadmap. Each milestone is a clean cycle: define → build → ship.

---

### Quick Mode

```
/gsd:quick
```

**For ad-hoc tasks that don&#039;t need full planning.**

Quick mode gives you GSD guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) with a faster path:

- **Same agents** — Planner + executor, same quality
- **Skips optional steps** — No research, no plan checker, no verifier
- **Separate tracking** — Lives in `.planning/quick/`, not phases

Use for: bug fixes, small features, config changes, one-off tasks.

```
/gsd:quick
&gt; What do you want to do? &quot;Add dark mode toggle to settings&quot;
```

**Creates:** `.planning/quick/001-add-dark-mode-toggle/PLAN.md`, `SUMMARY.md`

---

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

Claude Code is incredibly powerful *if* you give it the context it needs. Most people don&#039;t.

GSD handles it for you:

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded |
| `research/` | Ecosystem knowledge (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Scoped v1/v2 requirements with phase traceability |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you&#039;re going, what&#039;s done |
| `STATE.md` | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |
| `PLAN.md` | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps |
| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history |
| `todos/` | Captured ideas and tasks for later work |

Size limits based on where Claude&#039;s quality degrades. Stay under, get consistent excellence.

### XML Prompt Formatting

Every plan is structured XML optimized for Claude:

```xml
&lt;task type=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Create login endpoint&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;files&gt;src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts&lt;/files&gt;
  &lt;action&gt;
    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).
    Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  &lt;/action&gt;
  &lt;verify&gt;curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie&lt;/verify&gt;
  &lt;done&gt;Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401&lt;/done&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;
```

Precise instructions. No guessing. Verification built in.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Every stage uses the same pattern: a thin orchestrator spawns specialized agents, collects results, and routes to the next step.

| Stage | Orchestrator does | Agents do |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Research | Coordinates, presents findings | 4 parallel researchers investigate stack, features, architecture, pitfalls |
| Planning | Validates, manages iteration | Planner creates plans, checker verifies, loop until pass |
| Execution | Groups into waves, tracks progress | Executors implement in parallel, each with fresh 200k context |
| Verification | Presents results, routes next | Verifier checks codebase against goals, debuggers diagnose failures |

The orchestrator never does heavy lifting. It spawns agents, waits, integrates results.

**The result:** You can run an entire phase — deep research, multiple plans created and verified, thousands of lines of code written across parallel executors, automated verification against goals — and your main context window stays at 30-40%. The work happens in fresh subagent contexts. Your session stays fast and responsive.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

```bash
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing
lmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **Benefits:** Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task independently revertable. Clear history for Claude in future sessions. Better observability in AI-automated workflow.

Every commit is surgical, traceable, and meaningful.

### Modular by Design

- Add phases to current milestone
- Insert urgent work between phases
- Complete milestones and start fresh
- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything

You&#039;re never locked in. The system adapts.

Announcing **xyOps™**, the spiritual successor to Cronicle!  Beta v0.9 is now available for testing:

https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops

Let me know what you think!

Cronicle will still be supported and maintained going forward (mainly bug fixes and security issues will be patched).

# Overview

**Cronicle** is a multi-server task scheduler and runner, with a web based front-end UI.  It handles both scheduled, repeating and on-demand jobs, targeting any number of worker servers, with real-time stats and live log viewer.  It&#039;s basically a fancy [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) replacement written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).  You can give it simple shell commands, or write Plugins in virtually any language.

![Main Screenshot](https://pixlcore.com/software/cronicle/screenshots-new/job-details-complete.png)

## Features at a Glance

* Single or multi-server setup.
* Automated failover to backup servers.
* Auto-discovery of nearby servers.
* Real-time job status with live log viewer.
* Plugins can be written in any language.
* Schedule events in multiple timezones.
* Optionally queue up long-running events.
* Track CPU and memory usage for each job.
* Historical stats with performance graphs.
* Simple JSON messaging system for Plugins.
* Web hooks for external notification systems.
* Simple REST API for scheduling and running events.
* API Keys for authenticating remote apps.

## Glossary

A quick introduction to some common terms used in Cronicle:

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Server** | The primary server which keeps time and runs the scheduler, assigning jobs to other servers, and/or itself. |
| **Backup Server** | A worker server which will automatically become primary and take over duties if the current primary dies. |
| **Worker Server** | A server which sits idle until it is assigned jobs by the primary server. |
| **Server Group** | A named group of servers which can be targeted by events, and tagged as &quot;primary eligible&quot;, or &quot;worker only&quot;. |
| **API Key** | A special key that can be used by external apps to send API requests into Cronicle.  Remotely trigger jobs, etc. |
| **User** | A human user account, which has a username and a password.  Passwords are salted and hashed with [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt). |
| **Plugin** | Any executable script in any language, which runs a job and reads/writes JSON to communicate with Cronicle. |
| **Schedule** | The list of events, which are scheduled to run at particular times, on particular servers. |
| **Category** | Events can be assigned to categories which define defaults and optionally a color highlight in the UI. |
| **Event** | An entry in the schedule, which may run once or many times at any interval.  Each event points to a Plugin, and a server or group to run it. |
| **Job** | A running instance of an event.  If an event is set to run hourly, then a new job will be created every hour. |

&gt; A list of funny and tricky JavaScript examples

JavaScript is a great language. It has a simple syntax, large ecosystem and, what is most important, a great community.

At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with tricky parts. Some of them can quickly turn our everyday job into hell, and some of them can make us laugh out loud.

The original idea for WTFJS belongs to [Brian Leroux](https://twitter.com/brianleroux). This list is highly inspired by his talk [**“WTFJS”** at dotJS 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et8xNAc2ic8):

# 💪🏻 Motivation

&gt; Just for fun
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; _[**“Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary”**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_for_Fun), Linus Torvalds_

The primary goal of this list is to collect some crazy examples and explain how they work, if possible. Just because it&#039;s fun to learn something that we didn&#039;t know before.

If you are a beginner, you can use these notes to get a deeper dive into JavaScript. I hope these notes will motivate you to spend more time reading the specification.

If you are a professional developer, you can consider these examples as a great reference for all of the quirks and unexpected edges of our beloved JavaScript.

In any case, just read this. You&#039;re probably going to find something new.

&gt; **⚠️ Note:** If you enjoy reading this document, please, [consider supporting the author of this collection](#-supporting).

# ✍🏻 Notation

**`// -&gt;`** is used to show the result of an expression. For example:

```js
1 + 1; // -&gt; 2
```

**`// &gt;`** means the result of `console.log` or another output. For example:

```js
console.log(&quot;hello, world!&quot;); // &gt; hello, world!
```

**`//`** is just a comment used for explanations. Example:

```js
// Assigning a function to foo constant
const foo = function() {};
```

# 👀 Examples

## `[]` is equal `![]`

Array is equal not array:

```js
[] == ![]; // -&gt; true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The abstract equality operator converts both sides to numbers to compare them, and both sides become the number `0` for different reasons. Arrays are truthy, so on the right, the opposite of a truthy value is `false`, which is then coerced to `0`. On the left, however, an empty array is coerced to a number without becoming a boolean first, and empty arrays are coerced to `0`, despite being truthy.

Here is how this expression simplifies:

```js
+[] == +![];
0 == +false;
0 == 0;
true;
```

See also [`[]` is truthy, but not `true`](#-is-truthy-but-not-true).

- [**12.5.9** Logical NOT Operator (`!`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-logical-not-operator)
- [**7.2.15** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/index.html#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## `true` is not equal `![]`, but not equal `[]` too

Array is not equal `true`, but not Array is not equal `true` too;
Array is equal `false`, not Array is equal `false` too:

```js
true == []; // -&gt; false
true == ![]; // -&gt; false

false == []; // -&gt; true
false == ![]; // -&gt; true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

```js
true == []; // -&gt; false
true == ![]; // -&gt; false

// According to the specification

true == []; // -&gt; false

toNumber(true); // -&gt; 1
toNumber([]); // -&gt; 0

1 == 0; // -&gt; false

true == ![]; // -&gt; false

![]; // -&gt; false

true == false; // -&gt; false
```

```js
false == []; // -&gt; true
false == ![]; // -&gt; true

// According to the specification

false == []; // -&gt; true

toNumber(false); // -&gt; 0
toNumber([]); // -&gt; 0

0 == 0; // -&gt; true

false == ![]; // -&gt; true

![]; // -&gt; false

false == false; // -&gt; true
```

- [**7.2.15** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/index.html#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## true is false

```js
!!&quot;false&quot; == !!&quot;true&quot;; // -&gt; true
!!&quot;false&quot; === !!&quot;true&quot;; // -&gt; true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Consider this step-by-step:

```js
// true is &#039;truthy&#039; and represented by value 1 (number), &#039;true&#039; in string form is NaN.
true == &quot;true&quot;; // -&gt; false
false == &quot;false&quot;; // -&gt; false

// &#039;false&#039; is not the empty string, so it&#039;s a truthy value
!!&quot;false&quot;; // -&gt; true
!!&quot;true&quot;; // -&gt; true
```

- [**7.2.15** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/index.html#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## baNaNa

```js
&quot;b&quot; + &quot;a&quot; + +&quot;a&quot; + &quot;a&quot;; // -&gt; &#039;baNaNa&#039;
```

This is an old-school joke in JavaScript, but remastered. Here&#039;s the original one:

```js
&quot;foo&quot; + +&quot;bar&quot;; // -&gt; &#039;fooNaN&#039;
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The expression is evaluated as `&#039;foo&#039; + (+&#039;bar&#039;)`, which converts `&#039;bar&#039;` to not a number.

- [**12.8.3** The Addition Operator (`+`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-addition-operator-plus)
- [12.5.6 Unary + Operator](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-unary-plus-operator)

## `NaN` is not a `NaN`

```js
NaN === NaN; // -&gt; false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The specification strictly defines the logic behind this behavior:

&gt; 1. If `Type(x)` is different from `Type(y)`, return **false**.
&gt; 2. If `Type(x)` is Number, then
&gt;    1. If `x` is **NaN**, return **false**.
&gt;    2. If `y` is **NaN**, return **false**.
&gt;    3. … … …
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; [**7.2.14** Strict Equality Comparison](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-strict-equality-comparison)

Following the definition of `NaN` from the IEEE:

&gt; Four mutually exclusive relations are possible: less than, equal, greater than, and unordered. The last case arises when at least one operand is NaN. Every NaN shall compare unordered with everything, including itself.
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; [“What is the rationale for all comparisons returning false for IEEE754 NaN values?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1565164/1573715#1573715) at StackOverflow

## `Object.is()` and `===` weird cases

`Object.is()` determines if two values have the same value or not. It works similar to the `===` operator but there are a few weird cases:

```javascript
Object.is(NaN, NaN); // -&gt; true
NaN === NaN; // -&gt; false

Object.is(-0, 0); // -&gt; false
-0 === 0; // -&gt; true

Object.is(NaN, 0 / 0); // -&gt; true
NaN === 0 / 0; // -&gt; false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

In JavaScript lingo, `NaN` and `NaN` are the same value but they&#039;re not strictly equal. `NaN === NaN` being false is apparently due to historical reasons so it would probably be better to accept it as it is.

Similarly, `-0` and `0` are strictly equal, but they&#039;re not the same value.

For more details about `NaN === NaN`, see the above case.

- [Here are the TC39 specs about Object.is](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object.is)
- [Equality comparisons and sameness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness) on MDN

## It&#039;s a fail

You would not believe, but …

```js
(![] + [])[+[]] +
  (![] + [])[+!+[]] +
  ([![]] + [][[]])[+!+[] + [+[]]] +
  (![] + [])[!+[] + !+[]];
// -&gt; &#039;fail&#039;
```

### 💡 Explanation:

By breaking that mass of symbols into pieces, we notice that the following pattern occurs often:

```js
![] + []; // -&gt; &#039;false&#039;
![]; // -&gt; false
```

So we try adding `[]` to `false`. But due to a number of internal function calls (`binary + Operator` -&gt; `ToPrimitive` -&gt; `[[DefaultValue]]`) we end up converting the right operand to a string:

```js
![] + [].toString(); // &#039;false&#039;
```

Thinking of a string as an array we can access its first character via `[0]`:

```js
&quot;false&quot;[0]; // -&gt; &#039;f&#039;
```

The rest is obvious, but the `i` is tricky. The `i` in `fail` is grabbed by generating the string `&#039;falseundefined&#039;` and grabbing the element on index `[&#039;10&#039;]`.

More examples:

```js
+![]          // -&gt; 0
+!![]         // -&gt; 1
!![]          // -&gt; true
![]           // -&gt; false
[][[]]        // -&gt; undefined
+!![] / +![]  // -&gt; Infinity
[] + {}       // -&gt; &quot;[object Object]&quot;
+{}           // -&gt; NaN
```

## `[]` is truthy, but not `true`

An array is a truthy value, however, it&#039;s not equal to `true`.

```js
!![]       // -&gt; true
[] == true // -&gt; false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Here are links to the corresponding sections in the ECMA-262 specification:

- [**12.5.9** Logical NOT Operator (`!`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-logical-not-operator)
- [**7.2.15** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/index.html#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## `null` is falsy, but not `false`

Despite the fact that `null` is a falsy value, it&#039;s not equal to `false`.

```js
!!null; // -&gt; false
null == false; // -&gt; false
```

At the same time, other falsy values, like `0` or `&#039;&#039;` are equal to `false`.

```js
0 == false; // -&gt; true
&quot;&quot; == false; // -&gt; true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The explanation is the same as for previous example. Here&#039;s the corresponding link:

- [**7.2.15** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/index.html#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## `document.all` is an object, but it is undefined

&gt; ⚠️ This is part of the Browser API and won&#039;t work in a Node.js environment ⚠️

Despite the fact that `document.all` is an array-like object and it gives access to the DOM nodes in the page, it responds to the `typeof` function as `undefined`.

```js
document.all instanceof Object; // -&gt; true
typeof document.all; // -&gt; &#039;undefined&#039;
```

At the same time, `document.all` is not equal to `undefined`.

```js
document.all === undefined; // -&gt; false
document.all === null; // -&gt; false
```

But at the same time:

```js
document.all == null; // -&gt; true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

&gt; `document.all` used to be a way to access DOM elements, in particular with old versions of IE. While it has never been a standard it was broadly used in the old age JS code. When the standard progressed with new APIs (such as `document.getElementById`) this API call became obsolete and the standard committee had to decide what to do with it. Because of its broad use they decided to keep the API but introduce a willful violation of the JavaScript specification.
&gt; The reason why it responds to `false` when using the [Strict Equality Comparison](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-strict-equality-comparison) with `undefined` while `true` when using the [Abstract Equality Comparison](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/index.html#sec-abstract-equality-comparison) is due to the willful violation of the specification that explicitly allows that.

## Minimal value is greater than zero

`Number.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest number, which is greater than zero:

```js
Number.MIN_VALUE &gt; 0; // -&gt; true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

&gt; `Number.MIN_VALUE` is `5e-324`, i.e. the smallest positive number that can be represented within float precision, i.e. that&#039;s as close as you can get to zero. It defines the best resolution that floats can give you.
&gt;
&gt; Now the overall smallest value is `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` although it&#039;s not really numeric in a strict sense.
&gt;

## function is not a function

&gt; ⚠️ A bug present in V8 v5.5 or lower (Node.js &lt;=7) ⚠️

All of you know about the annoying _undefined is not a function_, but what about this?

```js
// Declare a class which extends null
class Foo extends null {}
// -&gt; [Function: Foo]

new Foo() instanceof null;
// &gt; TypeError: function is not a function
// &gt;     at … … …
```

### 💡 Explanation:

This is not a part of the specification. It&#039;s just a bug that has now been fixed, so there shouldn&#039;t be a problem with it in the future.

### Super constructor null of Foo is not a constructor

It&#039;s continuation of story with previous bug in modern environment (tested with Chrome 71 and Node.js v11.8.0).

```js
class Foo extends null {}
new Foo() instanceof null;
// &gt; TypeError: Super constructor null of Foo is not a constructor
```

### 💡 Explanation:

This is not a bug because:

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf(Foo.prototype); // -&gt; null
```

If the class has no constructor the call from prototype chain. But in the parent has no constructor. Just in case, I’ll clarify that `null` is an object:

```js
typeof null === &quot;object&quot;;
```

Therefore, you can inherit from it (although in the world of the OOP for such terms would have beaten me). So you can&#039;t call the null constructor. If you change this code:

```js
class Foo extends null {
  constructor() {
    console.log(&quot;something&quot;);
  }
}
```

You see the error:

```
ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing &#039;this&#039; or returning from derived constructor
```

And if you add `super`:

```js
class Foo extends null {
  constructor() {
    console.log(111);
    super();
  }
}
```

JS throws an error:

```
TypeError: Super constructor null of Foo is not a constructor
```

## Adding arrays

What if you try to add two arrays?

```js
[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]; // -&gt; &#039;1,2,34,5,6&#039;
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The concatenation happens. Step-by-step, it looks like this:

```js
[1, 2, 3] +
  [4, 5, 6][
    // call toString()
    (1, 2, 3)
  ].toString() +
  [4, 5, 6].toString();
// concatenation
&quot;1,2,3&quot; + &quot;4,5,6&quot;;
// -&gt;
(&quot;1,2,34,5,6&quot;);
```

## Trailing commas in array

You&#039;ve created an array with 4 empty elements. Despite all, you&#039;ll get an array with three elements, because of trailing commas:

```js
let a = [, , ,];
a.length; // -&gt; 3
a.toString()

#### JavaScript 3D library

The aim of the project is to create an easy-to-use, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose 3D library. The current builds only include WebGL and WebGPU renderers but SVG and CSS3D renderers are also available as addons.

### Usage

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
import * as THREE from &#039;three&#039;;

const width = window.innerWidth, height = window.innerHeight;

// init

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, width / height, 0.01, 10 );
camera.position.z = 1;

const scene = new THREE.Scene();

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
renderer.setSize( width, height );
renderer.setAnimationLoop( animate );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

// animation

function animate( time ) {

	mesh.rotation.x = time / 2000;
	mesh.rotation.y = time / 1000;

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}
```

If everything goes well, you should see [this](https://jsfiddle.net/w43x5Lgh/).

### Cloning this repository

Cloning the repo with all its history results in a ~2 GB download. If you don&#039;t need the whole history you can use the `depth` parameter to significantly reduce download size.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Odin Project Curriculum

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. Our curriculum is divided into distinct courses, each covering the subject language in depth. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give users the opportunity to practice what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed projects may then be included in the user&#039;s portfolio.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repo contains the actual lesson files used on our website. For the actual TOP app that pulls in this lesson content and contains our front-end and back-end code, please go to the [main TOP repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).

Our community can be found on the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB).

## Contributing

The Odin Project depends on open-source contributions to improve, grow, and thrive. We welcome contributors of all experience levels and backgrounds to help maintain this awesome curriculum and community. If you would like to contribute to our curriculum, be sure to thoroughly read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Some of the things you can do to contribute to our curriculum include:

- Correct typos and other grammar errors.
- Rewrite parts of existing lessons to make them clearer and easier to understand.
- Fix broken links.
- Add new resource links you think would make a lesson better.

## Introduction
[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

## General
**👉🏼 Want to score an easy open-source contribution?** Check out our [Good first issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) label.

**🕰️ Looking for the older version of Swagger UI?** Refer to the [*2.x* branch](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x).


This repository publishes three different NPM modules:

* [swagger-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc.).
* [swagger-ui-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that can&#039;t resolve npm module dependencies.
* [swagger-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-react) is Swagger UI packaged as a React component for use in React applications.

We strongly suggest that you use `swagger-ui` instead of `swagger-ui-dist` if you&#039;re building a single-page application, since `swagger-ui-dist` is significantly larger.

If you are looking for plain ol&#039; HTML/JS/CSS, [download the latest release](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest) and copy the contents of the `/dist` folder to your server.


## Compatibility
The OpenAPI Specification has undergone 5 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  Compatibility between Swagger UI and the OpenAPI Specification is as follows:

| Swagger UI Version | Release Date | OpenAPI Spec compatibility                                  | Notes                                                                 |

## Anonymized analytics

SwaggerUI uses [Scarf](https://scarf.sh/) to collect [anonymized installation analytics](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-what-information-does-scarf-js-send-about-me). These analytics help support the maintainers of this library and ONLY run during installation. To [opt out](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-how-can-i-opt-out-of-analytics), you can set the `scarfSettings.enabled` field to `false` in your project&#039;s `package.json`:

```
// package.json
{
  // ...
  &quot;scarfSettings&quot;: {
    &quot;enabled&quot;: false
  }
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `SCARF_ANALYTICS` to `false` as part of the environment that installs your npm packages, e.g., `SCARF_ANALYTICS=false npm install`.
