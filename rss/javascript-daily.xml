Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># React - The Complete Guide Course Resources

This repository provides access to code files, code snapshots, slides &amp; other resources that are used or provided by the [React - The Complete Guide](https://acad.link/reactjs) course.

If you&#039;re facing any issues with the code, please post in the course Q&amp;A section.

# Repository Content

- **Code Snapshots:** All code snapshots (starting snapshots, intermediate snapshots, finished snapshots) for the various course sections can be found in the [/code](/code/) folder.
- **Lecture Attachments:** Any standalone code files or other attachments that are mentioned in course lectures (and attached to those lectures) are stored in the [/attachments](/attachments/) folder.
- **Other Resources:** Other resources (like the course slides) can be found in the [/other](/other/) folder.

The **Code Snapshots** and **Lecture Attachments** folders contain one subfolder per course section - this allows you to easily access the resources for a specific course section.

# How To Use Code Snapshots

Code snapshots are primarily provided to allow you to compare your code to mine. The snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and therefore reflect my code you see in the videos.

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine. You&#039;ll need to run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server - just as shown in the course.

```
✨ This should launch Puter at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

### 🐙 Docker Compose

```bash
mkdir -p puter/config puter/data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 puter
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyPuter/puter/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```
✨ This should be available at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

#### Windows

```powershell
mkdir -p puter
cd puter
New-Item -Path &quot;puter\config&quot; -ItemType Directory -Force
New-Item -Path &quot;puter\data&quot; -ItemType Directory -Force
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyPuter/puter/main/docker-compose.yml&quot; -OutFile &quot;docker-compose.yml&quot;
docker compose up
```

## Installing

You can find prebuilt binaries for Min [here](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/releases). Alternatively, skip to the section below for instructions on how to build Min directly from source.

### Installation on Linux

- To install the .deb file, use `sudo dpkg -i /path/to/download`
- To install the RPM build, use `sudo rpm -i /path/to/download --ignoreos`
- On Arch Linux install from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/min-browser-bin).
- On Raspberry Pi, you can install Min from [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps).

## Getting Started

* The [wiki](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/wiki) provides an overview of the the features available in Min, a list of available keyboard shortcuts, and answers to some [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/wiki/FAQ).
* Min supports installing userscripts to extend its functionality. See the [userscript documentation](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/wiki/userscripts) for instructions on writing userscripts, as well as a collection of scripts written by the community.
* If you have questions about using Min, need help getting started with development, or want to talk about what we&#039;re working on, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bRpqjJ4).

## Developing

If you want to develop Min:

- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org).
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Start Min in development mode by running `npm run start`.
- After you make changes, press `alt+ctrl+r` (or `opt+cmd+r` on Mac) to reload the browser UI.

### Building binaries

In order to build Min from source, follow the installation instructions above, then use one of the following commands to create binaries:

- `npm run buildWindows`
- `npm run buildMacIntel`
- `npm run buildMacArm`
- `npm run buildDebian`
- `npm run buildRaspi` (for 32-bit Raspberry Pi)
- `npm run buildLinuxArm64` (for 64-bit Raspberry Pi or other ARM Linux)
- `npm run buildRedhat`

Depending on the platform you are building for, you may need to install additional dependencies:

- If you are building a macOS package, you&#039;ll need to install Xcode and the associated command-line tools. You may also need to set your default SDK to macOS 11.0 or higher, which you can do by running `export SDKROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.1.sdk`. The exact command will depend on where Xcode is installed and which SDK version you&#039;re using.
- To build on Windows, you&#039;ll need to install Visual Studio. Once it&#039;s installed, you may also need to run `npm config set msvs_version 2019` (or the appropriate version).

### Getting Help

If you&#039;re experiencing a bug or have a suggestion for how to improve Min, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/issues/new/choose).

### Contributing Code

- Start by following the development instructions listed above.
- The wiki has an [overview of Min&#039;s architecture](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/wiki/Architecture).
- Min uses the [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) code style; [most editors](https://standardjs.com/#are-there-text-editor-plugins) have plugins available to auto-format your code.
- If you see something that&#039;s missing, or run into any problems, please open an issue!

### Contributing Translations

#### Adding a new language

- Find the language code that goes with your language from [this list](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ui/base/l10n/l10n_util.cc;l=55) (line 55 - 230).
- In the `localization/languages` directory, create a new file, and name it &quot;[your language code].json&quot;.
- Open your new file, and copy the contents of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/minbrowser/min/blob/master/localization/languages/en-US.json&quot;&gt;localization/languages/en-US.json&lt;/a&gt; file into your new file.
- Change the &quot;identifier&quot; field in the new file to the language code from step 1.
- Inside the file, replace each English string in the right-hand column with the equivalent translation.
- (Optional) See your translations live by following the [development instructions](#installing) above. Min will display in the same language as your operating system, so make sure your computer is set to the same language that you&#039;re translating.
- That&#039;s it! Make a pull request with your changes.

#### Updating an existing language

- Find the language file for your language in the `localization/languages` directory.
- Look through the file for any items that have a value of &quot;null&quot;, or that have a comment saying &quot;missing translation&quot;.
- For each of these items, look for the item with the same name in the `en-US.json` file.
- Translate the value from the English file, replace &quot;null&quot; with your translation, and remove the &quot;missing translation&quot; comment.
- Make a pull request with the updated file.

**Iosevka** \[ˌjɔˈseβ.kʰa\] is an *open-source*, *sans-serif* + *slab-serif*, *monospace* + *quasi‑proportional* typeface family, designed for *writing code*, using in *terminals*, and preparing *technical documents*.

## Installation

### Installing from GitHub Releases

1. Download your font package from [releases](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/releases).
  * For Linux users you could use the following command to download all the TTC packages in the latest release:
    ```bash
    curl -s &#039;https://api.github.com/repos/be5invis/Iosevka/releases/latest&#039; | jq -r &quot;.assets[] | .browser_download_url&quot; | grep PkgTTC-Iosevka | xargs -n 1 curl -L -O --fail --silent --show-error
    ```
2. Quit all your editors / programs.
3. Unarchive the font package and you will see the font files.
4. Take actions depending on your OS:
    * **Windows**: Select the font files and drag into font [settings](ms-settings:fonts) / font control panel page.  
      * On Windows 10 1809 or newer, the default font installation is per-user, and it may cause compatibility issues for some applications, mostly written in Java. To cope with this, right click and select “Install for all users” instead. [Ref.](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JRE-1166?p=IDEA-200145)
    * **macOS**: [Follow instructions here](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2509).
    * **Linux** : Copy the font files to your fonts directory then run `sudo fc-cache`.

## Features

In the official package, Iosevka provides 6 monospace subfamilies (sans-serif and slab-serif, each in the 3 spacings Default, Term and Fixed) and 2 quasi-proportional subfamilies (Aile (sans-serif) and Etoile (slab-serif)). In all the monospace subfamilies, 9 weights (Thin to Heavy), 2 widths (Normal and Extended), and 3 slopes (Upright, Italic and Oblique) are included. In the quasi-proportional subfamilies, the quantity of widths is reduced to 1.

![Weights sample](images/weights.light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)![Weights sample](images/weights.dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

All versions include the same ranges of characters: Latin letters, Greek letters (including Polytonic), some Cyrillic letters, IPA symbols and common punctuations and some symbols. You can check out the full list [here](http://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/specimen).

### Stylistic Sets

Monospace Iosevka contains various stylistic sets to change the shape of certain characters. Enabling corresponded OpenType feature to enable.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;doc/stylistic-sets.md&quot;&gt;View list of stylistic sets of Iosevka.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


### Character Variants

Alongside stylistic sets, Monospace Iosevka can also be configured to cherry-pick variants for each character using OpenType. The variants are shown below. To enable, assign the feature tag to the variant index. For example, setting `cv26` to `6` will enable single-storey `a`.

**Caution :**  Certain software may limit the quantity of OpenType features and drop some of them if the feature list is too long. Please validate your feature configuration to ensure that it worked in your software.

Iosevka supports Language-Specific Ligations, which is the ligation set enabled only under certain languages. These ligation sets are assigned to custom feature tags. To use them, you need to turn **off** `calt` and enable the corresponded feature. The feature list is:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;doc/language-specific-ligation-sets.md&quot;&gt;View list of language-specific ligations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Please note that, due to the complex interactions when forming ligations, cherry-picking ligation groups will require a custom Iosevka build. The instructions could be seen below.

## Building from Source

# 安装&amp;升级

```
bash &lt;(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaxilu/x-ui/master/install.sh)
```

## 手动安装&amp;升级

1. 首先从 https://github.com/vaxilu/x-ui/releases 下载最新的压缩包，一般选择 `amd64`架构
2. 然后将这个压缩包上传到服务器的 `/root/`目录下，并使用 `root`用户登录服务器

&gt; 如果你的服务器 cpu 架构不是 `amd64`，自行将命令中的 `amd64`替换为其他架构

```
cd /root/
rm x-ui/ /usr/local/x-ui/ /usr/bin/x-ui -rf
tar zxvf x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x x-ui/x-ui x-ui/bin/xray-linux-* x-ui/x-ui.sh
cp x-ui/x-ui.sh /usr/bin/x-ui
cp -f x-ui/x-ui.service /etc/systemd/system/
mv x-ui/ /usr/local/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable x-ui
systemctl restart x-ui
```

## 使用docker安装

&gt; 此 docker 教程与 docker 镜像由[Chasing66](https://github.com/Chasing66)提供

1. 安装docker

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

2. 安装x-ui

```shell
mkdir x-ui &amp;&amp; cd x-ui
docker run -itd --network=host \
    -v $PWD/db/:/etc/x-ui/ \
    -v $PWD/cert/:/root/cert/ \
    --name x-ui --restart=unless-stopped \
    enwaiax/x-ui:latest
```

&gt; Build 自己的镜像

```shell
docker build -t x-ui .
```

## SSL证书申请

&gt; 此功能与教程由[FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)提供

脚本内置SSL证书申请功能，使用该脚本申请证书，需满足以下条件:

- 知晓Cloudflare 注册邮箱
- 知晓Cloudflare Global API Key
- 域名已通过cloudflare进行解析到当前服务器

获取Cloudflare Global API Key的方法:
    ![](media/bda84fbc2ede834deaba1c173a932223.png)
    ![](media/d13ffd6a73f938d1037d0708e31433bf.png)

使用时只需输入 `域名`, `邮箱`, `API KEY`即可，示意图如下：
        ![](media/2022-04-04_141259.png)

注意事项:

- 该脚本使用DNS API进行证书申请
- 默认使用Let&#039;sEncrypt作为CA方
- 证书安装目录为/root/cert目录
- 本脚本申请证书均为泛域名证书

## Tg机器人使用（开发中，暂不可使用）

&gt; 此功能与教程由[FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)提供

X-UI支持通过Tg机器人实现每日流量通知，面板登录提醒等功能，使用Tg机器人，需要自行申请
具体申请教程可以参考[博客链接](https://coderfan.net/how-to-use-telegram-bot-to-alarm-you-when-someone-login-into-your-vps.html)
使用说明:在面板后台设置机器人相关参数，具体包括

- Tg机器人Token
- Tg机器人ChatId
- Tg机器人周期运行时间，采用crontab语法  

参考语法：
- 30 * * * * * //每一分的第30s进行通知
- @hourly      //每小时通知
- @daily       //每天通知（凌晨零点整）
- @every 8h    //每8小时通知  

TG通知内容：
- 节点流量使用
- 面板登录提醒
- 节点到期提醒
- 流量预警提醒  

更多功能规划中...
## 建议系统

- CentOS 7+
- Ubuntu 16+
- Debian 8+

# 常见问题

## 从 v2-ui 迁移

首先在安装了 v2-ui 的服务器上安装最新版 x-ui，然后使用以下命令进行迁移，将迁移本机 v2-ui 的 `所有 inbound 账号数据`至 x-ui，`面板设置和用户名密码不会迁移`

&gt; 迁移成功后请 `关闭 v2-ui`并且 `重启 x-ui`，否则 v2-ui 的 inbound 会与 x-ui 的 inbound 会产生 `端口冲突`

```
x-ui v2-ui
```

## issue 关闭

各种小白问题看得血压很高

## 🌐 浏览器与脚本管理器

浏览器                               | 脚本管理器
:----------------------------------: | :---------:
Chrome 或 基于 Chromium 内核的浏览器 | [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] 或 [Violentmonkey][Violentmonkey]
Safari 浏览器（macOS, iOS, iPadOS）  | [Macaque][Macaque] 或 [Stay][Stay]
Firefox 或 基于 Gecko 内核的浏览器   | [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] 或 [Violentmonkey][Violentmonkey]
Via 浏览器（Android）                | 浏览器内自带

## 💽 安装

1. 安装用户脚本管理器。
1. 打开浏览器的开发者模式。
1. 然后再点击链接之一，安装脚本即可。
    - [GitHub 中文化插件 - GitHub 托管【开发版】][main.user.js]
    - [GitHub 中文化插件 - GreasyFork 托管【发布版】][main(greasyfork).user.js]
1. 刷新下页面，即可发现网站已中文化。

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 1. **开发版**：通常比**发布版**更早进入开发和测试阶段（重大版本更新前，还会专门创建新分支进行测试）。日常维护词库内容，并且词库版本号会在每周五凌晨自动更新。
&gt;    &gt; 注意: 
&gt;    &gt; - 如果版本号未更新，即使内容已更新，用户脚本管理器仍会忽略这些更新，需要手动安装以获取最新内容。
&gt; 1. **发布版**: 日常功能被冻结（除非由项目所有者进行更新）。通常在**开发版**词库版本号更新后的下周一凌晨，自动同步上一**开发版**的词库文件。通常情况下，**发布版**与**开发版**之间会存在一周的时间差。

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; ### 关于 “Chrome 127 及更高版本无法使用” 的问题
&gt; 这是由于 Chrome 127 及更高版本逐步切换到 Manifest V3。目前已知脚本管理器 [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] 5.2.0 及以上版本能够完美支持，而其他脚本管理器（如 Violentmonkey 等）可能无法正常运行此脚本。如果您使用的是其他脚本管理器，建议您改用支持 Manifest V3 的脚本管理器，或者将浏览器版本退回，等待相关脚本管理器开发者更新，或改用 Firefox 浏览器。详情请参阅 [#234](https://github.com/maboloshi/github-chinese/issues/234) 讨论。
&gt; #### 解决方案：
&gt; 1. 安装 [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] 5.2.0 或更高版本。
&gt; 1. 在浏览器的 “扩展程序” 管理中开启 “开发者模式”。

## 词库本地调试方法

1. 安装用户脚本管理器 [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey]。
1. 在浏览器扩展管理中，开启 [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] 的 “允许访问文件网址”。
1. 将修改的词库文件放到方便访问的本地位置。
1. 安装 [GitHub 中文化插件 - GitHub 托管【开发版】][main.user.js] 或 [GitHub 中文化插件 - GreasyFork 托管【发布版】][main(greasyfork).user.js]。
1. 回到脚本管理器，修改词库文件路径，如将 `// @require      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maboloshi/github-chinese/gh-pages/locals.js?v1.9.0` 改为本地路径格式如 `file:///D:/APP/github%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE/github-chinese/locals.js`。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 直接将词库文件拖到浏览器的地址栏，再复制地址栏的中地址即可。

### 2022-07-17 14:04:44

更新至 1.7.9

GitHub 的 ajax 载入方式逐步从 [defunkt/jquery-pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) 切换到 [hotwired/turbo](turbo.hotwired.dev), 导致已有的动态监测方式逐步失效

目前, 通过以下修复:

1. 新增 `BODY` 元素新增监视
1. 解析 `TURBO-FRAME` 框架, 获取对应的 `page`
1. 修复 github 新动态加载模式, 导致`翻译描述`返回值无法插入
1. 修复 github 新动态加载模式, 导致`chrome`浏览器自带翻译功能卡死页面

其他更新:

1. 修复`rePagePath`,`rePagePathRepo`,`rePagePathOrg`匹配规则，限制路径匹配层次，排除干扰
1. 直接使用网页URL`document.URL`变化触发`标题翻译`和`JS 筛选器`翻译
1. 修复`关闭正则`无法生效, 需要刷新页面才生效
1. 日常更新词库和忽略规则
1. 更新`JS 筛选器`规则

### 2022-06-29 13:27:12

更新至 1.7.8

1. 紧急修复: GitHub 变更了`document.body`和`title`更新机制, 导致原有的`监测更新`规则部分失效, 目前使用`document.documentElement`监视整个页面 DOM 的变更
1. 跳过`&lt;HEAD&gt;`标签
1. `标题翻译`和`JS 筛选器`翻译, 依据 URL变化更新

### 2022-06-26 16:41:58

更新至 1.7.7

1. 新增`时间元素翻译`功能
1. 重写`页面标题翻译`函数
1. 梳理`遍历节点`函数逻辑
1. 优化`transPage`函数，默认翻译公共部分
1. 调整`getPage`函数, 使`ClassName匹配规则`优先
1. 优化`translate`函数, 跳过`不存在英文字母和符号,.`, 保留首尾空白部分等
1. 部分函数重命名，使用`es6`新语法
1. 日常更新词库和忽略规则，修复一个`JS 选择器规则`

### 2022-05-12 13:53:46

更新至 1.7.6

1. 日常更新词库和忽略规则
1. 添加手动开启/禁用正则翻译，添加切换菜单
1. 优化翻译文本函数：避免已翻译词汇二次匹配，提高效率；局部翻译优先于全局

### 2021-10-07 13:16:16

原作者[楼教主](https://github.com/52cik/github-hans)已停止维护多年，且近年来 GitHub 页面结构的变化，导致原有的脚本无法正常工作。

虽然 GitHub 在被微软售收购比较重视国际化，启动并基本完成了GitHub 文档的中文化。但是，关于 GitHub 页面的中文化暂时还没启动。

对于，新手使用和高阶使用仍会存在一定的障碍。故，本人依据个人兴趣暂时进行了一定的修复和维护。

本次维护基本恢复和保留大部分功能如：页面正则翻译（含日期的正则）。页面词条可能被我切得太碎不方便后期维护（先这样吧！）

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

&lt;/div&gt;

## ✔ 待办 (TODO)

1. 添加 GitHub 名词解释，新手可能不太理解部分名词具体表达的意思，比如 `pull request`。
1. 整理部分 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) &amp; [GitHub](https://github.com/) 学习资料, 帮助新手**更快**上手。
1. **本人英文渣渣，翻译非常困难，急需大家 PR 共同翻译**

## ✨ 贡献

This is home to [Shields.io][shields.io], a service for concise, consistent,
and legible badges in SVG and raster format, which can easily be included in
GitHub readmes or any other web page. The service supports dozens of
continuous integration services, package registries, distributions, app
stores, social networks, code coverage services, and code analysis services.
Every month it serves over 1.6 billion images and is used by some of the
world&#039;s most popular open-source projects, [VS Code][vscode], [Vue.js][vue]
and [Bootstrap][bootstrap] to name a few.

[Make your own badges!][custom badges]
(Quick example: `https://img.shields.io/badge/left-right-f39f37`)

[custom badges]: https://img.shields.io/badges/static-badge

### Quickstart

Browse a [complete list of badges][shields.io] and locate a particular badge by using the search bar or by browsing the categories. Click on the badge to fill in required data elements for that badge type (like your username or repo) and optionally customize (label, colors etc.). And it&#039;s ready for use!

Use the button at the bottom to copy your badge url or snippet, which can then be added to places like your GitHub readme files or other web pages.

## Contributing

Shields is a community project. We invite your participation through issues
and pull requests! You can peruse the [contributing guidelines][contributing].

When adding or changing a service [please add tests][service-tests].

This project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you&#039;re new to the project,
maybe you&#039;d like to open a pull request to address one of them.

You can read a [tutorial on how to add a badge][tutorial].

## Development

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/badges/shields?quickstart=1)

1. Install Node 20 or later. You can use the [package manager][] of your choice.
   Tests need to pass in Node 20 and 22.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the badge server and the frontend dev server.
5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the frontend.

When server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart
itself (using [nodemon][]). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev
server (`docusaurus start`) should also automatically reload. However the badge
definitions are built only before the server first starts. To regenerate those,
either run `npm run prestart` or manually restart the server.

To debug a badge from the command line, run `npm run badge -- /npm/v/nock`.
It also works with full URLs like
`npm run badge -- https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nock`.

Use `npm run debug:server` to start server in debug mode.
[This recipe][nodemon debug] shows how to debug Node.js application in [VS Code][].

Shields has experimental support for [Gitpod][gitpod], a pre-configured development
environment that runs in your browser. To use Gitpod, click the button below and
sign in with GitHub. Gitpod also offers a browser add-on, though it is not required.
Please report any Gitpod bugs, questions, or suggestions in issue
[#2772](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/2772).

[![Edit with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/badges/shields)

[Snapshot tests][] ensure we don&#039;t inadvertently make changes that affect the
SVG or JSON output. When deliberately changing the output, run
`SNAPSHOT_DRY=1 npm run test:package` to preview changes to the saved
snapshots, and `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm run test:package` to update them.

The server can be configured to use [Sentry][] ([configuration][sentry configuration]) and [Prometheus][] ([configuration][prometheus configuration]).

Our [full test suite][full test suite] as well as [code coverage][code coverage] are run on a daily basis.

## History

b.adge.me was the original website for this service. Heroku back then had a
thing which made it hard to use a toplevel domain with it, hence the odd
domain. It used code developed in 2013 from a library called
[gh-badges][old-gh-badges], both developed by [Thaddée Tyl][espadrine].
The project merged with shields.io by making it use the b.adge.me code
and closed b.adge.me.

The original badge specification was developed in 2013 by
[Olivier Lacan][olivierlacan]. It was inspired by the Travis CI and similar
badges (there were a lot fewer, back then). In 2014 Thaddée Tyl redesigned
it with help from a Travis CI employee and convinced everyone to switch to
it. The old design is what today is called the plastic style; the new one
is the flat style.

You can read more about [the project&#039;s inception][thread],

[the specification itself][spec].

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/github/Atom/_apis/build/status/Atom%20Production%20Branches?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/github/Atom/_build/latest?definitionId=32&amp;branchName=master)

&gt; Atom and all repositories under Atom will be archived on December 15, 2022. Learn more in our [official announcement](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)

Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), and based on everything we love about our favorite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.

![Atom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/49132477-f4b77680-f31f-11e8-8357-ac6491761c6c.png)

## Documentation

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in [atom/flight-manual.atom.io](https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io).

The [API reference](https://atom.io/docs/api) for developing packages is also documented on Atom.io.

## Installing

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

### macOS

Download the latest [Atom release](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

### Windows

Download the latest [Atom installer](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest). `AtomSetup.exe` is 32-bit. For 64-bit systems, download `AtomSetup-x64.exe`.

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

You can also download `atom-windows.zip` (32-bit) or `atom-x64-windows.zip` (64-bit) from the [releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
The `.zip` version will not automatically update.

Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)? Run `cinst Atom` to install the latest version of Atom.

### Linux

Atom is only available for 64-bit Linux systems.

Configure your distribution&#039;s package manager to install and update Atom by following the [Linux installation instructions](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-linux) in the Flight Manual.  You will also find instructions on how to install Atom&#039;s official Linux packages without using a package repository, though you will not get automatic updates after installing Atom this way.

#### Archive extraction

An archive is available for people who don&#039;t want to install `atom` as root.

This version enables you to install multiple Atom versions in parallel. It has been built on Ubuntu 64-bit,
but should be compatible with other Linux distributions.

1. Install dependencies (on Ubuntu):
```sh
sudo apt install git libasound2 libcurl4 libgbm1 libgcrypt20 libgtk-3-0 libnotify4 libnss3 libglib2.0-bin xdg-utils libx11-xcb1 libxcb-dri3-0 libxss1 libxtst6 libxkbfile1
```
2. Download `atom-amd64.tar.gz` from the [Atom releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
3. Run `tar xf atom-amd64.tar.gz` in the directory where you want to extract the Atom folder.
4. Launch Atom using the installed `atom` command from the newly extracted directory.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to
repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.

## Building

* [Linux](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/#platform-linux)
