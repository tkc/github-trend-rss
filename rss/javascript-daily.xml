            <h2>README</h2><pre># 💌 Mailspring

**Mailspring is a new version of Nylas Mail maintained by one of the original authors. It&#039;s faster, leaner, and shipping today!** It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on [Mailcore2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2). It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero &quot;CPU Wakes&quot;, which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features.

Mailspring&#039;s UI is open source (GPLv3) and written in TypeScript with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - it&#039;s built on a plugin architecture and was designed to be easy to extend. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!

Mailspring&#039;s sync engine is spawned by the Electron application and runs locally on your computer. [It is open source (GPLv3) and written in C++ and C.](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Sync) For convenience, however, when you set up your development environment, Mailspring uses the latest version of the sync engine we&#039;ve shipped for your platform so you don&#039;t need to pull sources or install its compile-time dependencies.

## Features

Mailspring comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send
Later, Mail Rules, Templates and more. Mailspring Pro, which you can unlock
with a monthly subscription, adds even more features for people who send a ton
of email: link tracking, read receipts, mailbox analytics, contact and company
profiles. **All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send
your email credentials to the cloud.** For a full list of features, check out
[getmailspring.com](https://getmailspring.com/).

## Download Mailspring

You can download compiled versions of Mailspring for Windows, Mac OS X, and
Linux (deb, rpm and snap) from
[https://getmailspring.com/download](https://getmailspring.com/download).

## Getting Help

You can find community-based help and discussion with other Mailspring users on our
[Discourse community](https://community.getmailspring.com/).

## Contributing

Mailspring is entirely open-source. Pull requests and contributions are
welcome! There are three ways to contribute: building a plugin, building a
theme, and submitting pull requests to the project itself. When you&#039;re getting
started, you may want to join our
[Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/) so you can ask questions and
learn from other people doing development.

### Running Mailspring from Source

To install all dependencies and run Mailspring from its source code,
run the following commands from the root directory of the Mailspring repository:

```
export npm_config_arch=x64 # If you are on an M1 / Apple Silicon Mac
npm install
npm start
```

You can attach command line parameters by separating them using a double hyphen:

```
npm start -- --help
```

### Building Mailspring

To build Mailspring, you need to run the following command from the root directory
of the Mailspring repository:

```
npm run-script build
```

### Building A Plugin

Plugins lie at the heart of Mailspring and give it its powerful features.
Building your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools,
experiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started
guide](https://Foundry376.github.io/Mailspring/) to write your first plugin in
five minutes.

- To create your own theme, check out the
  [Mailspring-Theme-Starter](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter).

- To create your own plugin, check out the
  [Mailspring-Plugin-Starter](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Plugin-Starter).

A plugin &quot;store&quot; like the Chrome Web Store is coming soon, and will make it
easy for other users to discover plugins you create. (Right now, users need to
&quot;sideload&quot; the plugins into the app by downloading them and copying them into
place.)

You can share and browse Mailspring Plugins, and discuss plugin development
with other developers, on our
[Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/).

### Building a Theme

The Mailspring user interface is styled using CSS, which means it&#039;s easy to
modify and extend. Mailspring comes stock with a few beautiful themes, and
there are many more which have been built by community developers. To start
creating a theme, [clone the theme starter](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter)!

If you are updating an existing Nylas theme for Mailspring here is a
[step by step tutorial](https://community.getmailspring.com/t/updating-an-n1-nylas-mail-theme-for-mailspring/195).
Notice: as part of the update process you will probably need to [import mailspring base variables](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/issues/326#issuecomment-343757775).

You can share and browse Mailspring Themes, and discuss theme development with other developers, on our [Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/).

### Localizing / Translating

Mailspring (1.5.0 and above) supports localization. If you&#039;re a fluent speaker of
another language, we&#039;d love your help improving translations. Check out the
[LOCALIZATION](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/LOCALIZATION.md)
guide for more information. You can discuss localization and translation with
other developers on our [Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/).

### Contributing to Mailspring Core

Pull requests are always welcome - check out
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more information about setting up the development environment, running
tests locally, and submitting pull requests.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>About
----- 

**drawio-desktop** is a diagramming desktop app based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that wraps the [core draw.io editor](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).

Download built binaries from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).

**Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don&#039;t change the code and accept it is provided &quot;as-is&quot;, you can use it for any purpose.

Security
--------

draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.

No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. There is a Content Security Policy in place on the web part of the interface to ensure external transmission cannot happen, even by accident.

Security and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no.

Support
-------

Support is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support for non-paying users.

Purchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop.

Developing
----------

**draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.git`

To run this:
1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo)
2. [internal use only] export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode.
3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`.

Note: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also.

To release:
1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin.
2. Wait for the builds to complete (https://travis-ci.org/jgraph/drawio-desktop and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidjgraph/drawio-desktop)
3. Go to https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases, edit the preview release.
4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr http://rfc3161timestamp.globalsign.com/advanced /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe`
5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe`
6. Add release notes
7. Publish release

*Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them.

Local Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io`
- Windows: `C:\Users\&lt;USER-NAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\draw.io\`

Not open-contribution
---------------------

draw.io is closed to contributions (unless a maintainer permits it, which is extremely rare).

The level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes 
can break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required 
is far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we&#039;d have 
to basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented.

We are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, &amp; feature requests. We do
not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we&#039;ve
made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for 
the long term viability of the project.

&lt;/p&gt;

## Intro

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

### Input

&lt;!-- prettier-ignore --&gt;
```js
foo(reallyLongArg(), omgSoManyParameters(), IShouldRefactorThis(), isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne());
```

### Output

```js
foo(
  reallyLongArg(),
  omgSoManyParameters(),
  IShouldRefactorThis(),
  isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne(),
);
```

Prettier can be run [in your editor](https://prettier.io/docs/editors) on-save, in a [pre-commit hook](https://prettier.io/docs/precommit), or in [CI environments](https://prettier.io/docs/cli#list-different) to ensure your codebase has a consistent style without devs ever having to post a nit-picky comment on a code review ever again!

An efficient server implies a lower cost of the infrastructure, better
responsiveness under load, and happy users. How can you efficiently handle the
resources of your server, knowing that you are serving the highest number of
requests possible, without sacrificing security validations and handy
development?

Enter Fastify. Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best
developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.
It is inspired by Hapi and Express and as far as we know, it is one of the
fastest web frameworks in town.

The `main` branch refers to the Fastify `v5` release.
Check out the [`4.x` branch](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/tree/4.x) for `v4`.

### Quick start

Create a folder and make it your current working directory:

```sh
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
```

Generate a fastify project with `npm init`:

```sh
npm init fastify
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

To start the app in dev mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

For production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Under the hood `npm init` downloads and runs [Fastify
Create](https://github.com/fastify/create-fastify), which in turn uses the
generate functionality of [Fastify CLI](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cli).


### Install

To install Fastify in an existing project as a dependency:

```sh
npm i fastify
```

### Example

```js
// Require the framework and instantiate it

// ESM
import Fastify from &#039;fastify&#039;

const fastify = Fastify({
  logger: true
})
// CommonJs
const fastify = require(&#039;fastify&#039;)({
  logger: true
})

// Declare a route
fastify.get(&#039;/&#039;, (request, reply) =&gt; {
  reply.send({ hello: &#039;world&#039; })
})

// Run the server!
fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err
  // Server is now listening on ${address}
})
```

With async-await:

```js
// ESM
import Fastify from &#039;fastify&#039;

const fastify = Fastify({
  logger: true
})
// CommonJs
const fastify = require(&#039;fastify&#039;)({
  logger: true
})

fastify.get(&#039;/&#039;, async (request, reply) =&gt; {
  reply.type(&#039;application/json&#039;).code(200)
  return { hello: &#039;world&#039; }
})

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err
  // Server is now listening on ${address}
})
```

href=&quot;./docs/Guides/Getting-Started.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
If you learn best by reading code, explore the official [demo](https://github.com/fastify/demo).

&gt; ## Note
&gt; `.listen` binds to the local host, `localhost`, interface by default
&gt; (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`, depending on the operating system configuration). If
&gt; you are running Fastify in a container (Docker,
&gt; [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), etc.), you may need to bind to `0.0.0.0`. Be
&gt; careful when listening on all interfaces; it comes with inherent
&gt; [security
&gt; risks](https://web.archive.org/web/20170711105010/https://snyk.io/blog/mongodb-hack-and-secure-defaults/).
&gt; See [the documentation](./docs/Reference/Server.md#listen) for more
&gt; information.

### Core features

- **Highly performant:** as far as we know, Fastify is one of the fastest web
  frameworks in town, depending on the code complexity we can serve up to 76+
  thousand requests per second.
- **Extensible:** Fastify is fully extensible via its hooks, plugins, and
  decorators.
- **Schema-based:** even if it is not mandatory we recommend using [JSON
  Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to validate your routes and serialize your
  outputs. Internally Fastify compiles the schema in a highly performant
  function.
- **Logging:** logs are extremely important but are costly; we chose the best
  logger to almost remove this cost, [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)!
- **Developer friendly:** the framework is built to be very expressive and help
  developers in their daily use without sacrificing performance and
  security.

### Benchmarks

__Machine:__ EX41S-SSD, Intel Core i7, 4Ghz, 64GB RAM, 4C/8T, SSD.

__Method:__: `autocannon -c 100 -d 40 -p 10 localhost:3000` * 2, taking the
second average

These benchmarks taken using https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks. This is a
synthetic &quot;hello world&quot; benchmark that aims to evaluate the framework overhead.
The overhead that each framework has on your application depends on your
application. You should __always__ benchmark if performance matters to you.

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># npm - a JavaScript package manager

### Requirements

You should be running a currently supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run **`npm`**.  For a list of which versions of Node.js are currently supported, please see the [Node.js releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) page.

### Installation

**`npm`** comes bundled with [**`node`**](https://nodejs.org/), &amp; most third-party distributions, by default. Officially supported downloads/distributions can be found at: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### Direct Download

You can download &amp; install **`npm`** directly from [**npmjs**.com](https://npmjs.com/) using our custom `install.sh` script:

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### Node Version Managers

If you&#039;re looking to manage multiple versions of **`Node.js`** &amp;/or **`npm`**, consider using a [node version manager](https://github.com/search?q=node+version+manager+archived%3Afalse&amp;type=repositories&amp;ref=advsearch)

### Usage

```bash
npm &lt;command&gt;
```

### Links &amp; Resources

* [**Support**](https://www.npmjs.com/support) - Experiencing problems with the **npm** [website](https://npmjs.com) or [registry](https://registry.npmjs.org)? [File a ticket](https://www.npmjs.com/support)

### Acknowledgments

* `npm` is configured to use the **npm Public Registry** at [https://registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org) by default; Usage of this registry is subject to **Terms of Use** available at [https://npmjs.com/policies/terms](https://npmjs.com/policies/terms)
* You can configure `npm` to use any other compatible registry you prefer. You can read more about [configuring third-party registries](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/registry)

### FAQ on Branding

#### Is it &quot;npm&quot; or &quot;NPM&quot; or &quot;Npm&quot;?

**`npm`** should never be capitalized unless it is being displayed in a location that is customarily all-capitals (ex. titles on `man` pages).

#### Is &quot;npm&quot; an acronym for &quot;Node Package Manager&quot;?

Contrary to popular belief, **`npm`** **is not** in fact an acronym for &quot;Node Package Manager&quot;; It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for **&quot;npm is not an acronym&quot;** (if the project was named &quot;ninaa&quot;, then it would be an acronym). The precursor to **`npm`** was actually a bash utility named **&quot;pm&quot;**, which was the shortform name of **&quot;pkgmakeinst&quot;** - a bash function that installed various things on various platforms. If **`npm`** were to ever have been considered an acronym, it would be as &quot;node pm&quot; or, potentially &quot;new pm&quot;.

Hermes is a JavaScript engine optimized for fast start-up of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) apps. It features ahead-of-time static optimization and compact bytecode.

If you&#039;re only interested in using pre-built Hermes in a new or existing React Native app, you do not need to follow this guide or have direct access to the Hermes source. Instead, just follow [these instructions to enable Hermes](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes).

&gt; Noted that each Hermes release is aimed at a specific RN version. The rule of thumb is to always follow [Hermes releases](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/releases) strictly. Version mismatch can result in instant crash of your apps in the worst case scenario.

If you want to know how to build and hack on Hermes directly, and/or integrate Hermes built from source into a React Native app then read on.

The instructions here very briefly cover steps to build the Hermes CLI. They assume you have typical native development tools setup for your OS, and support for cmake and Ninja. For more details of required dependencies, building Hermes with different options, etc. follow these links instead:

* [Building and Running Hermes](doc/BuildingAndRunning.md)
* [Using a custom Hermes build in a React Native app](doc/ReactNativeIntegration.md#using-a-custom-hermes-build-in-a-react-native-app)

To build a local debug version of the Hermes CLI tools the following steps should get you started on macOS/Linux:

```shell
mkdir hermes_workingdir
cd hermes_workingdir
git clone https://github.com/facebook/hermes.git
cmake -S hermes -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build ./build
```

Or if you&#039;re using Windows, the following should get you going in a Git Bash shell:

```shell
mkdir hermes_workingdir
cd hermes_workingdir
git -c core.autocrlf=false clone https://github.com/facebook/hermes.git
cmake -S hermes -B build -G &#039;Visual Studio 16 2019&#039; -A x64
cmake --build ./build
```

You will now be in a directory with the output of building Hermes into CLI tools. From here you can run a piece of JavaScript as follows:

```shell
echo &quot;&#039;use strict&#039;; function hello() { print(&#039;Hello World&#039;); } hello();&quot; | ./bin/hermes
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

For information on using Node.js, see the [Node.js website][].

The Node.js project uses an [open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md). The
[OpenJS Foundation][] provides support for the project.

Contributors are expected to act in a collaborative manner to move
the project forward. We encourage the constructive exchange of contrary
opinions and compromise. The [TSC](./GOVERNANCE.md#technical-steering-committee)
reserves the right to limit or block contributors who repeatedly act in ways
that discourage, exhaust, or otherwise negatively affect other participants.

**This project has a [Code of Conduct][].**

## Support

Looking for help? Check out the
[instructions for getting support](.github/SUPPORT.md).

## Release types

* **Current**: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
  branch for its major version number (for example,
  [v22.x](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v22.x)). Node.js releases a new
  major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
  April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
  life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
  each October.
* **LTS**: Releases that receive Long Term Support, with a focus on stability
  and security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.
  LTS releases receive 12 months of _Active LTS_ support and a further 18 months
  of _Maintenance_. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered code names,
  beginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,
  except in some special circumstances.
* **Nightly**: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are
  changes. Use with caution.

Current and LTS releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). A
member of the Release Team [signs](#release-keys) each Current and LTS release.
For more information, see the
[Release README](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#readme).

### Download

Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
&lt;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&gt;.

#### Current and LTS releases

&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/release/&gt;

The [latest](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest/) directory is an
alias for the latest Current release. The latest-_codename_ directory is an
alias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the
[latest-hydrogen](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-hydrogen/)
directory contains the latest Hydrogen (Node.js 18) release.

#### Nightly releases

&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/&gt;

Each directory and filename includes the version (e.g., `v22.0.0`),
followed by the UTC date (e.g., `20240424` for April 24, 2024),
and the short commit SHA of the HEAD of the release (e.g., `ddd0a9e494`).
For instance, a full directory name might look like `v22.0.0-nightly20240424ddd0a9e494`.

#### API documentation

Documentation for the latest Current release is at &lt;https://nodejs.org/api/&gt;.
Version-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the
_docs_ subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at
&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/docs/&gt;.

### Verifying binaries

Download directories contain a `SHASUMS256.txt.asc` file with SHA checksums for the
files and the releaser PGP signature.

You can get a trusted keyring from nodejs/release-keys, e.g. using `curl`:

```bash
curl -fsLo &quot;/path/to/nodejs-keyring.kbx&quot; &quot;https://github.com/nodejs/release-keys/raw/HEAD/gpg/pubring.kbx&quot;
```

Alternatively, you can import the releaser keys in your default keyring, see
[Release keys](#release-keys) for commands to how to do that.

Then, you can verify the files you&#039;ve downloaded locally
(if you&#039;re using your default keyring, pass `--keyring=&quot;${GNUPGHOME:-~/.gnupg}/pubring.kbx&quot;`):

```bash
curl -fsO &quot;https://nodejs.org/dist/${VERSION}/SHASUMS256.txt.asc&quot; \
&amp;&amp; gpgv --keyring=&quot;/path/to/nodejs-keyring.kbx&quot; --output SHASUMS256.txt &lt; SHASUMS256.txt.asc \
&amp;&amp; shasum --check SHASUMS256.txt --ignore-missing
```

## Introduction
[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

## General
**👉🏼 Want to score an easy open-source contribution?** Check out our [Good first issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) label.

**🕰️ Looking for the older version of Swagger UI?** Refer to the [*2.x* branch](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x).


This repository publishes three different NPM modules:

* [swagger-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc.).
* [swagger-ui-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that can&#039;t resolve npm module dependencies.
* [swagger-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-react) is Swagger UI packaged as a React component for use in React applications.

We strongly suggest that you use `swagger-ui` instead of `swagger-ui-dist` if you&#039;re building a single-page application, since `swagger-ui-dist` is significantly larger.

If you are looking for plain ol&#039; HTML/JS/CSS, [download the latest release](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest) and copy the contents of the `/dist` folder to your server.


## Compatibility
The OpenAPI Specification has undergone 5 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  Compatibility between Swagger UI and the OpenAPI Specification is as follows:

| Swagger UI Version | Release Date | OpenAPI Spec compatibility                           | Notes                                                                 |

## Anonymized analytics

SwaggerUI uses [Scarf](https://scarf.sh/) to collect [anonymized installation analytics](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-what-information-does-scarf-js-send-about-me). These analytics help support the maintainers of this library and ONLY run during installation. To [opt out](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-how-can-i-opt-out-of-analytics), you can set the `scarfSettings.enabled` field to `false` in your project&#039;s `package.json`:

```
// package.json
{
  // ...
  &quot;scarfSettings&quot;: {
    &quot;enabled&quot;: false
  }
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `SCARF_ANALYTICS` to `false` as part of the environment that installs your npm packages, e.g., `SCARF_ANALYTICS=false npm install`.
