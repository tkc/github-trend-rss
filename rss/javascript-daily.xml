Learn more about our [version support](https://jquery.com/support/).

## Contribution Guides

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)

### References to issues/PRs

GitHub issues/PRs are usually referenced via `gh-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue/PR. You can find such an issue/PR under `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/NUMBER`.

jQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under [bugs.jquery.com](https://bugs.jquery.com/). It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern `trac-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under `https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/NUMBER`.

## Environments in which to use jQuery

- [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/)
- jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.

## What you need to build your own jQuery

To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

For Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.

## How to build your own jQuery

First, [clone the jQuery git repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Then, enter the jquery directory, install dependencies, and run the build script:

```bash
cd jquery
npm install
npm run build
```

The built version of jQuery will be placed in the `dist/` directory, along with a minified copy and associated map file.

## Build all jQuery release files

To build all variants of jQuery, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build:all
```

This will create all of the variants that jQuery includes in a release, including `jquery.js`, `jquery.slim.js`, `jquery.module.js`, and `jquery.slim.module.js` along their associated minified files and sourcemaps.

`jquery.module.js` and `jquery.slim.module.js` are [ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that export `jQuery` and `$` as named exports are placed in the `dist-module/` directory rather than the `dist/` directory.

## Building a Custom jQuery

The build script can be used to create a custom version of jQuery that includes only the modules you need.

Any module may be excluded except for `core`. When excluding `selector`, it is not removed but replaced with a small wrapper around native `querySelectorAll` (see below for more information).

### Build Script Help

To see the full list of available options for the build script, run the following:

```bash
npm run build -- --help
```

### Modules

To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the `src` folder (without the `.js` extension) to the `--exclude` option. When using the `--include` option, the default includes are dropped and a build is created with only those modules.

Some example modules that can be excluded or included are:

- **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.
- **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.
- **ajax/script**: The `&lt;script&gt;` AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.
- **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.
- **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).
- **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.
- **deprecated**: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.
- **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.
- **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(&quot;slow&quot;)`.
- **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.
- **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.
- **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.
- **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.
- **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(&quot;ready&quot;, ...)` or similar will not be triggered.
- **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.
- **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.
- **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.

- **selector**: The full jQuery selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced with a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser&#039;s `querySelectorAll` method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the [selector-native.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/src/selector-native.js) file for details.

*Note*: Excluding the full `selector` module will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as `effects/animatedSelector` and `css/hiddenVisibleSelectors`).

##### AMD name

You can set the module name for jQuery&#039;s AMD definition. By default, it is set to &quot;jquery&quot;, which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you&#039;d like to change this. Pass it to the `--amd` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --amd=&quot;custom-name&quot;
```

Or, to define anonymously, leave the name blank.

```bash
npm run build -- --amd
```

##### File name and directory

The default name for the built jQuery file is `jquery.js`; it is placed under the `dist/` directory. It&#039;s possible to change the file name using `--filename` and the directory using `--dir`. `--dir` is relative to the project root.

```bash
npm run build -- --slim --filename=&quot;jquery.slim.js&quot; --dir=&quot;/tmp&quot;
```

This would create a slim version of jQuery and place it under `tmp/jquery.slim.js`.

##### ECMAScript Module (ESM) mode

By default, jQuery generates a regular script JavaScript file. You can also generate an ECMAScript module exporting `jQuery` as the default export using the `--esm` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.module.js --esm
```

##### Factory mode

By default, jQuery depends on a global `window`. For environments that don&#039;t have one, you can generate a factory build that exposes a function accepting `window` as a parameter that you can provide externally (see [`README` of the published package](build/fixtures/README.md) for usage instructions). You can generate such a factory using the `--factory` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.js --factory
```

This option can be mixed with others like `--esm` or `--slim`:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.slim.module.js --factory --esm --slim --dir=&quot;/dist-module&quot;
```

#### Custom Build Examples

Create a custom build using `npm run build`, listing the modules to be excluded. Excluding a top-level module also excludes its corresponding directory of modules.

Exclude all **ajax** functionality:

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=ajax
```

Excluding **css** removes modules depending on CSS: **effects**, **offset**, **dimensions**.

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=css
```

Exclude a bunch of modules (`-e` is an alias for `--exclude`):

```bash
npm run build -- -e ajax/jsonp -e css -e deprecated -e dimensions -e effects -e offset -e wrap
```

There is a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.js --slim
```

Or, to create the slim build as an esm module:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.module.js --slim --esm
```

*Non-official custom builds are not regularly tested. Use them at your own risk.*

## Running the Unit Tests

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start `npm start` to auto-build jQuery as you work:

```bash
npm start
```

Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the &quot;test&quot; directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:

- Windows: [WAMP download](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
- Mac: [MAMP download](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
- Linux: [Setting up LAMP](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/easy-lamp-server-installation/)
- [Mongoose (most platforms)](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)

## Essential Git

As the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it&#039;s useful to know some features used.

### Cleaning

If you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you&#039;ve worked on is gone after these):

```bash
git reset --hard upstream/main
git clean -fdx
```

### Rebasing

For feature/topic branches, you should always use the `--rebase` flag to `git pull`, or if you are usually handling many temporary &quot;to be in a github pull request&quot; branches, run the following to automate this:

```bash
git config branch.autosetuprebase local
```

(see `man git-config` for more information)

### Handling merge conflicts

If you&#039;re getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature
`git mergetool`. Even though the default tool `xxdiff` looks awful/old, it&#039;s rather useful.

The following are some commands that can be used there:

- `Ctrl + Alt + M` - automerge as much as possible
- `b` - jump to next merge conflict
- `s` - change the order of the conflicted lines
- `u` - undo a merge
- `left mouse button` - mark a block to be the winner
- `middle mouse button` - mark a line to be the winner
- `Ctrl + S` - save
- `Ctrl + Q` - quit

## [QUnit](https://api.qunitjs.com) Reference

### Test methods

```js
expect( numAssertions );
stop();
start();
```

*Note*: QUnit&#039;s eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.

### Test assertions

```js
ok( value, [message] );
equal( actual, expected, [message] );
notEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
deepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
strictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
throws( block, [expected], [message] );
```

## Test Suite Convenience Methods Reference

See [test/data/testinit.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/test/data/testinit.js).

### Returns an array of elements with the given IDs

```js
q( ... );
```

Example:

```js
q( &quot;main&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; );

=&gt; [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]
```

### Asserts that a selection matches the given IDs

```js
t( testName, selector, [ &quot;array&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;ids&quot; ] );
```

Example:

```js
t(&quot;Check for something&quot;, &quot;//[a]&quot;, [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]);
```

### Fires a native DOM event without going through jQuery

```js
fireNative( node, eventType );
```

Example:

```js
fireNative( jQuery( &quot;#elem&quot; )[ 0 ], &quot;click&quot; );
```

### Add random number to url to stop caching

```js
url( &quot;some/url&quot; );
```

Example:

```js
url( &quot;index.html&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/index.html?10538358428943&quot;


url( &quot;mock.php?foo=bar&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/mock.php?foo=bar&amp;10538358345554&quot;
```

### Run tests in an iframe

Some tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and
these can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions
remain in jQuery&#039;s main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup
and setup code should be placed in the iframe file.

```js
testIframe( testName, fileName,
  function testCallback(
      assert, jQuery, window, document,
	  [ additional args ] ) {
	...
  } );
```

This loads a page, constructing a url with fileName `&quot;./data/&quot; + fileName`.
The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by
including the &quot;/test/data/iframeTest.js&quot; script and calling
`startIframeTest( [ additional args ] )` when appropriate. Often this
will be after either document ready or `window.onload` fires.

The `testCallback` receives the QUnit `assert` object created by `testIframe`
for this test, followed by the global `jQuery`, `window`, and `document` from
the iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to `startIframeTest`,
they follow the `document` argument.

Social Analyzer - API, CLI, and Web App for analyzing &amp; finding a person&#039;s profile across +1000 social media \ websites. It includes different analysis and detection modules, and you can choose which modules to use during the investigation process.

The detection modules utilize a rating mechanism based on different detection techniques, which produces a rate value that starts from 0 to 100 (No-Maybe-Yes). This module is intended to have fewer false positives.

The analysis and public extracted information from this OSINT tool could help investigate profiles related to suspicious or malicious activities such as cyberbullying, cyber grooming, cyberstalking, and spreading misinformation.

`This project is currently used by some law enforcement agencies in countries where resources are limited - The detection database is different than the one shared here..`

Templates are the core of the [nuclei scanner](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) which powers the actual scanning engine.
This repository stores and houses various templates for the scanner provided by our team, as well as contributed by the community.
We hope that you also contribute by sending templates via **pull requests** or [Github issues](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=submit-template.md&amp;title=%5Bnuclei-template%5D+) to grow the list.


## Nuclei Templates overview


An overview of the nuclei template project, including statistics on unique tags, author, directory, severity, and type of templates. The table below contains the top ten statistics for each matrix; an expanded version of this is [available here](TEMPLATES-STATS.md), and also available in [JSON](TEMPLATES-STATS.json) format for integration.

    ```
-   ### Snapcraft
    ```
    sudo snap install ytdownloader
    ```

## macOS 🍎

Since the app is not signed, when you will try to open the app, macOS will not allow you to open it. 

You need to open terminal and execute:
```
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/YTDownloader.app 
```

You will also need to install `yt-dlp` with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
brew install yt-dlp
```

## Internationalization (Localization) 🌍

Translations into other languages would be highly appreciated. If you want to help translating the app to other languages, you can join from [here](https://crwd.in/ytdownloader). Open a new issue and that language will be added to Crowdin. Please don&#039;t make pull requests with json files, instead use Crowdin.

## Used technologies

-   [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
-   [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
-   [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
-   [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)

## For building or running from source code

[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) (along with npm) needs to be installed.

Required commands to get started.

```
git clone https://github.com/aandrew-me/ytDownloader.git
cd ytDownloader
npm i
```

To run with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) :

```
npm start
```

You need to download ffmpeg and put it in the root directory of the project. If you don&#039;t need to build for arm processor, you can download ffmpeg by executing any of the files - linux.sh / mac.sh / windows.sh depending on the platform. Otherwise you need to download ffmpeg from [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) for windows/linux and from [here](http://www.osxexperts.net/) for mac (not tested)

To build for Linux (It will create packages as specified in package.json). The builds are stored in **release** folder.
```
npm run linux
```

To build for Windows

```
npm run windows
```

To build for macOS

```
npm run mac
```
If you only want to build for one format, you can do
```
npx electron-builder -l appimage
```
It will just create a linux appimage build.

## Installing

### Package manager

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install axios
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add axios
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
$ pnpm add axios
```

Using bun:

```bash
$ bun add axios
```

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using `import` or `require` approach:

```js
import axios, { isCancel, AxiosError } from &quot;axios&quot;;
```

You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:

```js
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;

console.log(axios.isCancel(&quot;something&quot;));
```

If you use `require` for importing, **only the default export is available**:

```js
const axios = require(&quot;axios&quot;);

console.log(axios.isCancel(&quot;something&quot;));
```

For some bundlers and some ES6 linters you may need to do the following:

```js
import { default as axios } from &quot;axios&quot;;
```

For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:

```js
const axios = require(&quot;axios/dist/browser/axios.cjs&quot;); // browser commonJS bundle (ES2017)
// const axios = require(&#039;axios/dist/node/axios.cjs&#039;); // node commonJS bundle (ES2017)
```

### CDN

Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.13.2/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Using unpkg CDN:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/axios@1.13.2/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Example

```js
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;
//const axios = require(&#039;axios&#039;); // legacy way

try {
  const response = await axios.get(&quot;/user?ID=12345&quot;);
  console.log(response);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios
  .get(&quot;/user&quot;, {
    params: {
      ID: 12345,
    },
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .finally(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(&quot;/user?ID=12345&quot;);
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

&gt; **Note**: `async/await` is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
&gt; Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.

Performing a `POST` request

```js
const response = await axios.post(&quot;/user&quot;, {
  firstName: &quot;Fred&quot;,
  lastName: &quot;Flintstone&quot;,
});
console.log(response);
```

Performing multiple concurrent requests

```js
function getUserAccount() {
  return axios.get(&quot;/user/12345&quot;);
}

function getUserPermissions() {
  return axios.get(&quot;/user/12345/permissions&quot;);
}

Promise.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()]).then(function (results) {
  const acct = results[0];
  const perm = results[1];
});
```

## axios API

Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to `axios`.

##### axios(config)

```js
// Send a POST request
axios({
  method: &quot;post&quot;,
  url: &quot;/user/12345&quot;,
  data: {
    firstName: &quot;Fred&quot;,
    lastName: &quot;Flintstone&quot;,
  },
});
```

```js
// GET request for remote image in node.js
const response = await axios({
  method: &quot;get&quot;,
  url: &quot;https://bit.ly/2mTM3nY&quot;,
  responseType: &quot;stream&quot;,
});
response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(&quot;ada_lovelace.jpg&quot;));
```

##### axios(url[, config])

```js
// Send a GET request (default method)
axios(&quot;/user/12345&quot;);
```

### Request method aliases

For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.

##### axios.request(config)

##### axios.get(url[, config])

##### axios.delete(url[, config])

##### axios.head(url[, config])

##### axios.options(url[, config])

##### axios.post(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios.put(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios.patch(url[, data[, config]])

###### NOTE

When using the alias methods `url`, `method`, and `data` properties don&#039;t need to be specified in config.

### Concurrency (Deprecated)

Please use `Promise.all` to replace the below functions.

Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.

axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)

### Creating an instance

You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.

##### axios.create([config])

```js
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: &quot;https://some-domain.com/api/&quot;,
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: { &quot;X-Custom-Header&quot;: &quot;foobar&quot; },
});
```

### Instance methods

The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.

##### axios#request(config)

##### axios#get(url[, config])

##### axios#delete(url[, config])

##### axios#head(url[, config])

##### axios#options(url[, config])

##### axios#post(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#put(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#patch(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#getUri([config])

## Request Config

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the `url` is required. Requests will default to `GET` if `method` is not specified.

```js
{
  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: &#039;/user&#039;,

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: &#039;get&#039;, // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` u

Run 🤗 Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server!

Transformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face&#039;s [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:
  - 📝 **Natural Language Processing**: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
  - 🖼️ **Computer Vision**: image classification, object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation.
  - 🗣️ **Audio**: automatic speech recognition, audio classification, and text-to-speech.
  - 🐙 **Multimodal**: embeddings, zero-shot audio classification, zero-shot image classification, and zero-shot object detection.

Transformers.js uses [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to run models in the browser. The best part about it, is that you can easily [convert](#convert-your-models-to-onnx) your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX using [🤗 Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum#onnx--onnx-runtime). 

For more information, check out the full [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js).


## Installation


To install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@huggingface/transformers), run:
```bash
npm i @huggingface/transformers
```

Alternatively, you can use it in vanilla JS, without any bundler, by using a CDN or static hosting. For example, using [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), you can import the library with:
```html
&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;
    import { pipeline } from &#039;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@huggingface/transformers@4.0.0-next.2&#039;;
&lt;/script&gt;
```


## Quick tour


It&#039;s super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the python library, we support the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it the easiest way to run models with the library.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th width=&quot;440px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Python (original)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th width=&quot;440px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Javascript (ours)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
pipe = pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;)

out = pipe(&#039;I love transformers!&#039;)
# [{&#039;label&#039;: &#039;POSITIVE&#039;, &#039;score&#039;: 0.999806941}]
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```javascript
import { pipeline } from &#039;@huggingface/transformers&#039;;

// Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
const pipe = await pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;);

const out = await pipe(&#039;I love transformers!&#039;);
// [{&#039;label&#039;: &#039;POSITIVE&#039;, &#039;score&#039;: 0.999817686}]
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


You can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the second argument to the `pipeline` function. For example:
```javascript
// Use a different model for sentiment-analysis
const pipe = await pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;, &#039;Xenova/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment&#039;);
```

By default, when running in the browser, the model will be run on your CPU (via WASM). If you would like
to run the model on your GPU (via WebGPU), you can do this by setting `device: &#039;webgpu&#039;`, for example:
```javascript
// Run the model on WebGPU
const pipe = await pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;, &#039;Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english&#039;, {
  device: &#039;webgpu&#039;,
});
```

For more information, check out the [WebGPU guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/guides/webgpu).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The WebGPU API is still experimental in many browsers, so if you run into any issues,
&gt; please file a [bug report](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/issues/new?title=%5BWebGPU%5D%20Error%20running%20MODEL_ID_GOES_HERE&amp;assignees=&amp;labels=bug,webgpu&amp;projects=&amp;template=1_bug-report.yml).

In resource-constrained environments, such as web browsers, it is advisable to use a quantized version of
the model to lower bandwidth and optimize performance. This can be achieved by adjusting the `dtype` option,
which allows you to select the appropriate data type for your model. While the available options may vary
depending on the specific model, typical choices include `&quot;fp32&quot;` (default for WebGPU), `&quot;fp16&quot;`, `&quot;q8&quot;`
(default for WASM), and `&quot;q4&quot;`. For more information, check out the [quantization guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/guides/dtypes).
```javascript
// Run the model at 4-bit quantization
const pipe = await pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;, &#039;Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english&#039;, {
  dtype: &#039;q4&#039;,
});
```

Ready to dive in? Explore our wide variety of demo applications and templates [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js-examples). You can also launch your own project instantly using the official Transformers.js [template](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=static-templates%2Ftransformers.js) on Hugging Face!



## Custom usage



By default, Transformers.js uses [hosted pretrained models](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers.js) and [precompiled WASM binaries](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@huggingface/transformers@4.0.0-next.2/dist/), which should work out-of-the-box. You can customize this as follows:

### Settings

```javascript
import { env } from &#039;@huggingface/transformers&#039;;

// Specify a custom location for models (defaults to &#039;/models/&#039;).
env.localModelPath = &#039;/path/to/models/&#039;;

// Disable the loading of remote models from the Hugging Face Hub:
env.allowRemoteModels = false;

// Set location of .wasm files. Defaults to use a CDN.
env.backends.onnx.wasm.wasmPaths = &#039;/path/to/files/&#039;;
```

For a full list of available settings, check out the [API Reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/api/env).

### Convert your models to ONNX

We recommend using [Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-onnx) to convert your PyTorch models to ONNX in a single command. For the full list of supported architectures, check out the [Optimum documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-onnx/onnx/overview).


## Supported tasks/models

Here is the list of all tasks and architectures currently supported by Transformers.js. If you don&#039;t see your task/model listed here or it is not yet supported, feel free to open up a feature request [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/issues/new/choose).

To find compatible models on the Hub, select the &quot;transformers.js&quot; library tag in the filter menu (or visit [this link](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers.js)). You can refine your search by selecting the task you&#039;re interested in (e.g., [text-classification](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification&amp;library=transformers.js)).

至于为什么仓库名要叫CookLikeHOC，因为直接写Laoxiangji大概不方便阅读，而Home Original Chicken是china daily报道中所使用的老乡鸡的英文名，故简写成HOC。

- Node.js &gt;= 18.0.0

## 快速开始

### 方式一：一键部署脚本（推荐）

**Windows (cmd.exe)**：
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuw1535/antigravity2api-nodejs/main/setup.bat &amp;&amp; setup.bat
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**：
```powershell
IwR -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuw1535/antigravity2api-nodejs/main/setup.bat -OutFile setup.bat; .\setup.bat
```

**Linux/macOS**：
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuw1535/antigravity2api-nodejs/main/setup.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x setup.sh &amp;&amp; ./setup.sh
```

或使用 curl：
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuw1535/antigravity2api-nodejs/main/setup.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x setup.sh &amp;&amp; ./setup.sh
```

脚本会自动完成以下操作：
1. 克隆项目仓库
2. 安装依赖
3. 复制配置文件
4. 配置管理员凭据（交互式输入）
5. 启动服务

### 快速启动（已部署）

如果已经部署成功，可以使用启动脚本快速启动服务：

**Windows**：
```bash

```

**Linux/macOS**：
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

### 更新项目

使用更新脚本可以安全地更新到最新版本（自动保存本地修改）：

**Windows**：
```bash
update.bat
```

**Linux/macOS**：
```bash
chmod +x update.sh
./update.sh
```

更新完成后，可以选择：
- 恢复本地修改：`git stash pop`
- 删除本地修改：`git stash drop`

### 方式二：手动部署

#### 1. 安装依赖

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2. 配置环境变量

首次启动时，如果 `.env` 和 `config.json` 不存在，系统会自动创建默认配置文件。

你也可以手动复制示例文件：

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp config.json.example config.json
```

编辑 `.env` 文件配置必要参数：

```env
# 必填配置（留空则自动生成随机凭据）
API_KEY=sk-text
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key-change-this-in-production

# 可选配置
# PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890
# SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION=你是聊天机器人
# IMAGE_BASE_URL=http://your-domain.com
```

#### 3. 登录获取 Token

```bash
npm run login
```

浏览器会自动打开 Google 授权页面，授权后 Token 会保存到 `data/accounts.json`。

#### 4. 启动服务

```bash
npm start
```

服务将在 `http://localhost:8045` 启动。

## 二进制文件部署（推荐）

无需安装 Node.js，直接下载预编译的二进制文件即可运行。

### 下载二进制文件

从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ZhaoShanGeng/antigravity2api-nodejs/releases) 下载对应平台的二进制文件：

| 平台 | 文件名 |
|------|--------|
| Windows x64 | `antigravity2api-win-x64.exe` |
| Linux x64 | `antigravity2api-linux-x64` |
| Linux ARM64 | `antigravity2api-linux-arm64` |
| macOS x64 | `antigravity2api-macos-x64` |
| macOS ARM64 | `antigravity2api-macos-arm64` |

### 准备配置文件

将以下文件放在二进制文件同目录下：

```
├── antigravity2api-win-x64.exe  # 二进制文件
├── .env                          # 环境变量配置（可选，首次启动自动创建）
├── config.json.example           # 配置示例文件（必需）
├── public/                       # 静态文件目录（必需）
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── bg.jpg
│   └── js/
│       ├── auth.js
│       ├── config.js
│       ├── main.js
│       ├── quota.js
│       ├── tokens.js
│       ├── ui.js
│       └── utils.js
└── data/                         # 数据目录（自动创建）
    └── accounts.json
```

### 配置环境变量

创建 `.env` 文件：

```env
API_KEY=sk-your-api-key
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key-change-this-in-production
# IMAGE_BASE_URL=http://your-domain.com
# PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890
```

### 运行

**Windows**：
```bash
# 直接双击运行，或在命令行执行
antigravity2api-win-x64.exe
```

**Linux/macOS**：
```bash
# 添加执行权限
chmod +x antigravity2api-linux-x64

# 运行
./antigravity2api-linux-x64
```

### 二进制部署说明

- **无需 Node.js**：二进制文件已包含 Node.js 运行时
- **自动配置**：首次启动时自动从 `config.json.example` 创建 `config.json`
- **配置文件**：`config.json.example` 必须与二进制文件在同一目录
- **静态文件**：`public/` 目录必须与二进制文件在同一目录
- **数据持久化**：`data/` 目录会自动创建，用于存储 Token 数据
- **跨平台**：支持 Windows、Linux、macOS（x64 和 ARM64）

### 作为系统服务运行（Linux）

创建 systemd 服务文件 `/etc/systemd/system/antigravity2api.service`：

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Antigravity2API Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/opt/antigravity2api
ExecStart=/opt/antigravity2api/antigravity2api-linux-x64
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

启动服务：

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable antigravity2api
sudo systemctl start antigravity2api
```

## Docker 部署

### 使用 Docker Compose（推荐）

1. **一键构建**

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

该命令会自动：
- 从 `.env.example` 创建 `.env`（如果不存在）
- 从 `config.json.example` 创建 `config.json`（如果不存在）
- 创建必要的目录（`data/`、`public/images/`）
- 执行 `docker-compose build` 构建镜像

2. **启动服务**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. **查看日志**

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

4. **停止服务**

```bash
docker compose down
```

### 手动构建

如果需要手动构建，请先准备配置文件：

```bash
# 复制配置文件
cp .env.example .env
cp config.json.example config.json

# 创建必要目录
mkdir -p data public/images

# 构建镜像
docker build -t antigravity2api .
```

2. **运行容器**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name antigravity2api \
  -p 8045:8045 \
  -e API_KEY=sk-text \
  -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123 \
  -e JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key \
  -e IMAGE_BASE_URL=http://your-domain.com \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -v $(pwd)/public/images:/app/public/images \
  -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env \
  -v $(pwd)/config.json:/app/config.json \
  antigravity2api
```

3. **查看日志**

```bash
docker logs -f antigravity2api
```

### Docker 部署说明

- 数据持久化：`data/` 目录挂载到容器，保存 Token 数据
- 图片存储：`public/images/` 目录挂载到容器，保存生成的图片
- 配置文件：`.env` 和 `config.json` 挂载到容器，支持热更新
- 端口映射：默认映射 8045 端口，可根据需要修改
- 自动重启：容器异常退出会自动重启

## Zeabur 部署

### 使用预构建镜像部署

1. **创建服务**

在 Zeabur 控制台创建新服务，使用以下镜像：

```
ghcr.io/liuw1535/antigravity2api-nodejs
```

2. **配置环境变量**

在服务设置中添加以下环境变量：

| 环境变量 | 说明 | 示例值 |
|--------|------|--------|
| `API_KEY` | API 认证密钥 | `sk-your-api-key` |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | 管理员用户名 | `admin` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | 管理员密码 | `your-secure-password` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT 密钥 | `your-jwt-secret-key` |
| `IMAGE_BASE_URL` | 图片服务基础 URL | `https://your-domain.zeabur.app` |

可选环境变量：
- `PROXY`：代理地址
- `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`：系统提示词

3. **配置持久化存储**

在服务的「Volumes」设置中添加以下挂载点：

| 挂载路径 | 说明 |
|---------|------|
| `/app/data` | Token 数据存储 |
| `/app/public/images` | 生成的图片存储 |

⚠️ **重要提示**：
- 只挂载 `/app/data` 和 `/app/public/images` 这两个目录
- 不要挂载其他目录（如 `/app/.env`、`/app/config.json` 等），否则会导致必要配置文件被清空，项目无法启动

4. **绑定域名**

在服务的「Networking」设置中绑定域名，然后将该域名设置到 `IMAGE_BASE_URL` 环境变量中。

5. **启动服务**

保存配置后，Zeabur 会自动拉取镜像并启动服务。访问绑定的域名即可使用。

### Zeabur 部署说明

- 使用预构建的 Docker 镜像，无需手动构建
- 通过环境变量配置所有必要参数
- 持久化存储确保 Token 和图片数据不丢失

### 快速测试

```bash
curl http://localhost:8045/v1/chat/completions \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer sk-text&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gemini-2.0-flash-exp&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;你好&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

## 多账号管理

```json
[
  {
    &quot;access_token&quot;: &quot;ya29.xxx&quot;,
    &quot;refresh_token&quot;: &quot;1//xxx&quot;,
    &quot;expires_in&quot;: 3599,
    &quot;timestamp&quot;: 1234567890000,
    &quot;enable&quot;: true
  },
  {
    &quot;access_token&quot;: &quot;ya29.yyy&quot;,
    &quot;refresh_token&quot;: &quot;1//yyy&quot;,
    &quot;expires_in&quot;: 3599,
    &quot;timestamp&quot;: 1234567890000,
    &quot;enable&quot;: true
  }
]
```

- `enable: false` 可禁用某个账号
- Token 过期会自动刷新
- 刷新失败（403）会自动禁用并切换下一个账号

## 配置说明

项目配置分为两部分：

### 1. config.json（基础配置）

基础配置文件，包含服务器、API 和默认参数设置。

首次启动时，如果 `config.json` 不存在，系统会自动从 `config.json.example` 复制一份默认配置。

配置示例：

```json
{
  &quot;server&quot;: {
    &quot;port&quot;: 8045,              // 服务端口
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;,         // 监听地址
    &quot;maxRequestSize&quot;: &quot;500mb&quot;, // 最大请求体大小
    &quot;heartbeatInterval&quot;: 15000,// 心跳间隔（毫秒），防止 Cloudflare 超时
    &quot;memoryThreshold&quot;: 100     // 内存阈值（MB），超过时触发 GC
  },
  &quot;rotation&quot;: {
    &quot;strategy&quot;: &quot;round_robin&quot;, // 轮询策略：round_robin/quota_exhausted/request_count
    &quot;requestCount&quot;: 50         // request_count 策略下每个 Token 的请求次数
  },
  &quot;defaults&quot;: {
    &quot;temperature&quot;: 1,          // 默认温度参数
    &quot;topP&quot;: 1,                 // 默认 top_p
    &quot;topK&quot;: 50,                // 默认 top_k
    &quot;maxTokens&quot;: 32000,        // 默认最大 token 数
    &quot;thinkingBudget&quot;: 1024     // 默认思考预算（仅对思考模型生效，范围 1024-32000）
  },
  &quot;cache&quot;: {
    &quot;modelListTTL&quot;: 3600000    // 模型列表缓存时间（毫秒），默认 1 小时
  },
  &quot;other&quot;: {
    &quot;timeout&quot;: 300000,         // 请求超时时间（毫秒）
    &quot;skipProjectIdFetch&quot;: false,// 跳过 ProjectId 获取，直接随机生成（仅 Pro 账号有效）
    &quot;useNativeAxios&quot;: false,   // 使用原生 axios 而非 AntigravityRequester
    &quot;useContextSystemPrompt&quot;: false, // 是否将请求中的 system 消息合并到 SystemInstruction
    &quot;passSignatureToClient&quot;: false   // 是否将 thoughtSignature 透传到客户端
  }
}
```

### 轮询策略说明

| 策略 | 说明 |
|------|------|
| `round_robin` | 均衡负载：每次请求后切换到下一个 Token |
| `quota_exhausted` | 额度耗尽才切换：持续使用当前 Token 直到额度用完（高性能优化） |
| `request_count` | 自定义次数：每个 Token 使用指定次数后切换（默认策略） |

### 2. .env（敏感配置）

环境变量配置文件，包含敏感信息和可选配置：

| 环境变量 | 说明 | 必填 |
|--------|------|------|
| `API_KEY` | API 认证密钥 | ✅ |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | 管理员用户名 | ✅ |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | 管理员密码 | ✅ |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT 密钥 | ✅ |
| `PROXY` | 代理地址（如：http://127.0.0.1:7890），也支持系统代理环境变量 
|`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` | ❌ |
| `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` | 系统提示词 | ❌ |
| `IMAGE_BASE_URL` | 图片服务基础 URL | ❌ |

完整配置示例请参考 `.env.example` 文件。

## Pro 账号随机 ProjectId

对于 Pro 订阅账号，可以跳过 API 验证直接使用随机生成的 ProjectId：

1. 在 `config.json` 文件中设置：
```json
{
  &quot;other&quot;: {
    &quot;skipProjectIdFetch&quot;: true
  }
}
```

2. 运行 `npm run login` 登录时会自动使用随机生成的 ProjectId

3. 已有账号也会在使用时自动生成随机 ProjectId

注意：此功能仅适用于 Pro 订阅账号。官方已修复免费账号使用随机 ProjectId 的漏洞。

## 资格校验自动回退

当 OAuth 登录或添加 Token 时，系统会自动检测账号的订阅资格：

1. **有资格的账号**：正常使用 API 返回的 ProjectId
2. **无资格的账号**：自动生成随机 ProjectId，避免添加失败

这一机制确保了：
- 无论账号是否有 Pro 订阅，都能成功添加 Token
- 自动降级处理，无需手动干预
- 不会因为资格校验失败而阻止登录流程

## 真 System 消息合并

本服务支持将开头连续的多条 system 消息与全局 SystemInstruction 合并：

```
请求消息：
[system] 你是助手
[system] 请使用中文回答
[user] 你好

合并后：
SystemInstruction = 全局配置的系统提示词 + &quot;\n\n&quot; + &quot;你是助手\n\n请使用中文回答&quot;
messages = [{role: user, content: 你好}]
```

这一设计：
- 兼容 OpenAI 的多 system 消息格式
- 充分利用 Antigravity 的 SystemInstruction 功能
- 确保系统提示词的完整性和优先级

## 多 API 格式支持

本服务支持三种 API 格式，每种格式都有完整的参数支持：

### OpenAI 格式 (`/v1/chat/completions`)

| `thinking.type` | 思考开关 (`enabled`/`disabled`) | - |
| `thinking.budget_tokens` | 思考预算 (1024-32000) | 1024 |

### Gemini 格式 (`/v1beta/models/:model:generateContent`)

```json
{
  &quot;contents&quot;: [...],
  &quot;generationConfig&quot;: {
    &quot;maxOutputTokens&quot;: 16000,
    &quot;temperature&quot;: 0.7,
    &quot;topP&quot;: 0.9,
    &quot;topK&quot;: 40,
    &quot;thinkingConfig&quot;: {
      &quot;includeThoughts&quot;: true,
      &quot;thinkingBudget&quot;: 10000
    }
  }
}
```

| 参数 | 说明 | 默认值 |
|------|------|--------|
| `maxOutputTokens` | 最大输出 token 数 | 32000 |
| `temperature` | 温度 (0.0-1.0) | 1 |
| `topP` | Top-P 采样 | 1 |
| `topK` | Top-K 采样 | 50 |
| `thinkingConfig.includeThoughts` | 是否包含思考内容 | true |
| `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget` | 思考预算 (1024-32000) | 1024 |

### 统一参数处理

所有三种格式的参数都会被统一规范化处理，确保一致的行为：

1. **参数优先级**：请求参数 &gt; 配置文件默认值
2. **思考预算优先级**：`thinking_budget`/`budget_tokens`/`thinkingBudget` &gt; `reasoning_effort` &gt; 配置文件默认值
3. **禁用思考**：设置 `thinking_budget=0` 或 `thinking.type=&quot;disabled&quot;` 或 `thinkingConfig.includeThoughts=false`

### DeepSeek 思考格式兼容

本服务自动适配 DeepSeek 的 `reasoning_content` 格式，将思维链内容单独输出，避免与正常内容混淆：

```json
{
  &quot;choices&quot;: [{
    &quot;message&quot;: {
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;最终答案&quot;,
      &quot;reasoning_content&quot;: &quot;这是思考过程...&quot;
    }
  }]
}
```

### reasoning_effort 映射

| 值 | 思考 Token 预算 |
|---|----------------|
| `low` | 1024 |
| `medium` | 16000 |
| `high` | 32000 |

## 内存优化

本服务经过深度内存优化：

### 优化效果

| 指标 | 优化前 | 优化后 |
|------|--------|--------|
| 进程数 | 8+ | 2 |
| 内存占用 | 100MB+ | 50MB+ |
| GC 频率 | 高 | 低 |

### 优化手段

1. **对象池复用**：流式响应对象通过对象池复用，减少 50%+ 临时对象创建
2. **预编译常量**：正则表达式、格式字符串等预编译，避免重复创建
3. **LineBuffer 优化**：高效的流式行分割，避免频繁字符串操作
4. **自动内存清理**：堆内存超过阈值时自动触发 GC
5. **进程精简**：移除不必要的子进程，统一在主进程处理

### 动态内存阈值

内存压力阈值根据用户配置的 `memoryThreshold`（MB）动态计算：

| 压力级别 | 阈值比例 | 默认值（100MB 配置） | 行为 |
|---------|---------|---------------------|------|
| LOW | 30% | 30MB | 正常运行 |
| MEDIUM | 60% | 60MB | 轻度清理 |
| HIGH | 100% | 100MB | 积极清理 + GC |
| CRITICAL | &gt;100% | &gt;100MB | 紧急清理 + 强制 GC |

### 配置

```json
{
  &quot;server&quot;: {
    &quot;memoryThreshold&quot;: 100
  }
}
```

- `memoryThreshold`：高压力阈值（MB），其他级别按比例自动计算

## 心跳机制

为防止 Cloudflare 等 CDN 因长时间无响应而断开连接，本服务实现了 SSE 心跳机制：

- 在流式响应期间，定期发送心跳包（`: heartbeat\n\n`）
- 默认间隔 15 秒，可配置
- 心跳包符合 SSE 规范，客户端会自动忽略

### 配置

```json
{
  &quot;server&quot;: {
    &quot;heartbeatInterval&quot;: 15000
  }
}
```

- `heartbeatInterval`：心跳间隔（毫秒），设为 0 禁用心跳

## 代码架构

### 转换器模块

项目支持三种 API 格式（OpenAI、Gemini、Claude），转换器代码经过优化，提取了公共模块：

## About
**A WhatsApp API client that operates via the WhatsApp Web browser.**

The library launches the WhatsApp Web browser app via Puppeteer, accessing its internal functions and creating a managed instance to reduce the risk of being blocked. This gives the API client nearly all WhatsApp Web features for dynamic use in a Node.js application.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn&#039;t be considered totally safe.**

    console.log(&#039;QR RECEIVED&#039;, qr);
});

client.on(&#039;ready&#039;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;Client is ready!&#039;);
});

client.on(&#039;message&#039;, msg =&gt; {
    if (msg.body == &#039;!ping&#039;) {
        msg.reply(&#039;pong&#039;);
    }
});

client.initialize();
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Love open source? We&#039;re hiring! Ghost is looking staff engineers to [join the team](https://careers.ghost.org) and work with us full-time

&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/353959/169805900-66be5b89-0859-4816-8da9-528ed7534704.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fiercely independent, professional publishing. Ghost is the most popular open source, headless Node.js CMS which already works with all the tools you know and love.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

The easiest way to get a production instance deployed is with our official **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** managed service. It takes about 2 minutes to launch a new site with worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance all done for you.

For most people this ends up being the best value option because of [how much time it saves](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/) — and 100% of revenue goes to the Ghost Foundation; funding the maintenance and further development of the project itself. So you’ll be supporting open source software *and* getting a great service!

&amp;nbsp;

# Quickstart install

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our **CLI tool**

```
npm install ghost-cli -g
```

&amp;nbsp;

Then, if installing locally add the `local` flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

```
ghost install local
```

&amp;nbsp;

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/)

```
ghost install
```

&amp;nbsp;

Check out our [official documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/) for more information about our [recommended hosting stack](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/) &amp; properly [upgrading Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/update/), plus everything you need to develop your own Ghost [themes](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/) or work with [our API](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/).

Pipedream is an integration platform for developers.

Pipedream provides a free, hosted platform for connecting apps and developing event-driven automations. The platform has over 1,000 fully-integrated applications, so you can use pre-built components to quickly send messages to Slack, add a new row to Google Sheets, and more. You can also run any Node.js, Python, Golang, or Bash code when you need custom logic. Pipedream has demonstrated SOC 2 compliance and can provide a SOC 2 Type 2 report upon request (please email support@pipedream.com).

&lt;/p&gt;

This repo contains:

- [The code for all pre-built integration components](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components)
- [The product roadmap](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/issues)
- [The Pipedream docs](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/docs)
- And other source code related to Pipedream.

This `README` explains the key features of the platform and how to get started.

## Key Features

- [Workflows](#workflows) - Workflows run automations. Workflows are sequences of steps - pre-built actions or custom [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/), [Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/), [Golang](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/), or [Bash](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/) code - triggered by an event (HTTP request, timer, when a new row is added to a Google Sheets, and more).
- [Event Sources](#event-sources) - Sources trigger workflows. They emit events from services like GitHub, Slack, Airtable, RSS and [more](https://pipedream.com/apps). When you want to run a workflow when an event happens in any third-party app, you&#039;re using an event source.
- [Actions](#actions) - Actions are pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common operations across Pipedream&#039;s 1,000+ API integrations. For example, you can use actions to send email, add a row to a Google Sheet, [and more](https://pipedream.com/apps).
- [Custom code](#code) - Most integrations require custom logic. Code is often the best way to express that logic, so Pipedream allows you to run any [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/), [Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/), [Golang](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/), or [Bash](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/) code. You can import any package from the languages&#039; package managers, connect to any Pipedream connected app, and more. Pipedream is &quot;low-code&quot; in the best way: you can use pre-built components when you&#039;re performing common actions, but you can write custom code when you need to.
- [Destinations](#destinations) - Deliver events asynchronously to common destinations like Amazon S3, Snowflake, HTTP and email.
- [Free](#pricing) - No fees for individual developers (see [limits](https://docs.pipedream.com/limits/))

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

### Workflows

Workflows are sequences of linear [steps](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/steps) triggered by an event (like an HTTP request, or when a new row is added to a Google sheet). You can quickly develop complex automations using workflows and connect to any of our 1,000+ integrated apps.

[See our workflow quickstart](https://pipedream.com/docs/quickstart/) to get started.

### Event Sources

[Event Sources](https://pipedream.com/docs/sources/) watch for new data from services like GitHub, Slack, Airtable, RSS and [more](https://pipedream.com/apps). When a source finds a new event, it emits it, triggering any linked workflows.

You can also consume events emitted by sources using [Pipedream&#039;s REST API](https://pipedream.com/docs/api/rest/) or a private, real-time [SSE stream](https://pipedream.com/docs/api/sse/).

When a pre-built source doesn&#039;t exist for your use case, [you can build your own](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/quickstart/nodejs/sources/). Here is the simplest event source: it exposes an HTTP endpoint you can send any request to, and prints the contents of the request when invoked:

```javascript
export default {
  name: &quot;http&quot;,
  version: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,
  props: {
    http: &quot;$.interface.http&quot;,
  },
  run(event) {
    console.log(event); // event contains the method, payload, etc.
  },
};
```

&lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/sources/new?app=http&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/m0bBsSL/deploy-clean.png&quot; height=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You can find the code for all pre-built sources in [the `components` directory](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components). If you find a bug or want to contribute a feature, [see our contribution guide](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/guidelines/#process).

### Actions

[Actions](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/actions/) are pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common operations across Pipedream&#039;s 500+ API integrations. For example, you can use actions to send email, add a row to a Google Sheet, [and more](https://pipedream.com/apps).

You can [create your own actions](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/quickstart/nodejs/actions/), which you can re-use across workflows. You can also [publish actions to the entire Pipedream community](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/guidelines/), making them available for anyone to use.

Here&#039;s an action that accepts a `name` as input and prints it to the workflow&#039;s logs:

```javascript
export default {
  name: &quot;Action Demo&quot;,
  description: &quot;This is a demo action&quot;,
  key: &quot;action_demo&quot;,
  version: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,
  type: &quot;action&quot;,
  props: {
    name: {
      type: &quot;string&quot;,
      label: &quot;Name&quot;,
    },
  },
  async run() {
    return `hello ${this.name}!`;
  },
};
```

You can find the code for all pre-built actions in [the `components` directory](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components). If you find a bug or want to contribute a feature, [see our contribution guide](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/guidelines/#process).

### Custom code

Most integrations require custom logic. Code is often the best way to express that logic, so Pipedream allows you to run custom code in a workflow using:

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;Node.js&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1646761316/docs/icons/icons8-nodejs_aax6wn.svg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;Python&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1647356607/docs/icons/python-logo-generic_k3o5w2.svg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;Go&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1646763751/docs/icons/Go-Logo_Blue_zhkchv.svg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;Bash&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1647356698/docs/icons/full_colored_dark_1_-svg_vyfnv7.svg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

You can import any package from the languages&#039; package managers by declaring the imports directly in code. Pipedream will parse and download the necessary dependencies.

```javascript
// Node.js
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;
```

```python
# Python
import pandas as pd
```

```golang
// Go
import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    pd &quot;github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream-go&quot;
)
```

You can also [connect to any Pipedream connected app in custom code steps](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/auth/). For example, you can connect your Slack account and send a message to a channel:

```javascript
import { WebClient } from &quot;@slack/web-api&quot;;

export default defineComponent({
  props: {
    // This creates a connection called &quot;slack&quot; that connects a Slack account.
    slack: {
      type: &quot;app&quot;,
      app: &quot;slack&quot;,
    },
  },
  async run({ steps, $ }) {
    const web = new WebClient(this.slack.$auth.oauth_access_token);

    return await web.chat.postMessage({
      text: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;,
      channel: &quot;#general&quot;,
    });
  },
});
```

### Destinations

[Destinations](https://pipedream.com/docs/destinations/), like actions, abstract the connection, batching, and delivery logic required to send events to services like Amazon S3, or targets like HTTP and email.

For example, sending data to an Amazon S3 bucket is as simple as calling `$send.s3()`:

```javascript
$send.s3({
  bucket: &quot;your-bucket-here&quot;,
  prefix: &quot;your-prefix/&quot;,
  payload: event.body,
});
```

Pipedream supports the following destinations:

- [Amazon S3](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/s3/)
- [Snowflake](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/snowflake/)
- [HTTP](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/http/)
- [Email](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/email/)
- [SSE](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/sse/)

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a new way to build web applications. It&#039;s a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.

Learn more at the [Svelte website](https://svelte.dev), or stop by the [Discord chatroom](https://svelte.dev/chat).
