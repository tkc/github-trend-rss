### 📋 Setting up your environment

This curriculum has a development environment ready to go! As you get started you can choose to run the curriculum in a [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces/) (_a browser-based, no installs needed environment_), or locally on your computer using a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon).

#### Create your repository
For you to easily save your work, it is recommended that you create your own copy of this repository. You can do this by clicking the **Use this template** button at the top of the page. This will create a new repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the curriculum.

Follow these steps:
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the &quot;Fork&quot; button at the top-right corner of this page.
2. **Clone the Repository**:   `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners.git`

#### Running the curriculum in a Codespace

In your copy of this repository that you created, click the **Code** button and select **Open with Codespaces**. This will create a new Codespace for you to work in.

&lt;img src=&quot;./images/createcodespace.png&quot; alt=&quot;Create codespace&quot; style=&quot;width:270px;&quot;/&gt;

#### Running the curriculum locally on your computer

To run this curriculum locally on your computer, you will need a text editor, a browser and a command line tool. Our first lesson, [Introduction to Programming Languages and Tools of the Trade](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-getting-started-lessons/1-intro-to-programming-languages), will walk you through various options for each of these tools for you to select what works best for you.

Our recommendation is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) as your editor, which also has a built-in [Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon). You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon).


1. Clone your repository to your computer. You can do this by clicking the **Code** button and copying the URL:

    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/createcodespace.png&quot; alt=&quot;Copy your repository URL&quot; style=&quot;width:270px;&quot;/&gt;

    Then, open [Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) and run the following command, replacing `&lt;your-repository-url&gt;` with the URL you just copied:

    ```bash 
    git clone &lt;your-repository-url&gt;
    ```

2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by clicking **File** &gt; **Open Folder** and selecting the folder you just cloned.


&gt;  Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions:
&gt;
&gt; * [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&amp;WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) - to preview HTML pages within Visual Studio Code
&gt; * [Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot&amp;WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) - to help you write code faster

&lt;br/&gt;

## Getting Started

### 💻 Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter
cd puter
npm install
npm start
```
✨ This should launch Puter at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;



If this does not work, see [First Run Issues](./doc/self-hosters/first-run-issues.md) for
troubleshooting steps.

&lt;br/&gt;

### 🐳 Docker

```bash
mkdir puter &amp;&amp; cd puter &amp;&amp; mkdir -p puter/config puter/data &amp;&amp; sudo chown -R 1000:1000 puter &amp;&amp; docker run --rm -p 4100:4100 -v `pwd`/puter/config:/etc/puter -v `pwd`/puter/data:/var/puter  ghcr.io/heyputer/puter
```
✨ This should launch Puter at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

### 🐙 Docker Compose

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
mkdir -p puter/config puter/data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 puter
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyPuter/puter/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```
✨ This should be available at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

#### Windows

```powershell
mkdir -p puter
cd puter
New-Item -Path &quot;puter\config&quot; -ItemType Directory -Force
New-Item -Path &quot;puter\data&quot; -ItemType Directory -Force
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyPuter/puter/main/docker-compose.yml&quot; -OutFile &quot;docker-compose.yml&quot;
docker compose up
```
✨ This should launch Puter at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

Remember that each data has its own trade-offs. And you need to pay attention more to why you&#039;re choosing a certain data structure than to how to implement it.

### Algorithms by Paradigm

An algorithmic paradigm is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class
of algorithms. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an
algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program.

  * `B` [Tower of Hanoi](src/algorithms/uncategorized/hanoi-tower)
  * `B` [Pascal&#039;s Triangle](src/algorithms/math/pascal-triangle)

  * `A` [Regular Expression Matching](src/algorithms/string/regular-expression-matching)
* **Backtracking** - similarly to brute force, try to generate all possible solutions, but each time you generate the next solution, you test
if it satisfies all conditions and only then continue generating subsequent solutions. Otherwise, backtrack and go on a
different path to finding a solution. Normally the DFS traversal of state-space is being used.
  * `B` [Jump Game](src/algorithms/uncategorized/jump-game)

  * `A` [Combination Sum](src/algorithms/sets/combination-sum) - find all combinations that form specific sum
* **Branch &amp; Bound** - remember the lowest-cost solution found at each stage of the backtracking
search, and use the cost of the lowest-cost solution found so far as a lower bound on the cost of
a least-cost solution to the problem in order to discard partial solutions with costs larger than the
lowest-cost solution found so far. Normally, BFS traversal in combination with DFS traversal of state-space
tree is being used.

## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs don&#039;t even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt in Cursor:

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM&#039;s context.

- 1️⃣ Write your prompt naturally
- 2️⃣ Tell the LLM to `use context7`
- 3️⃣ Get working code answers

No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don&#039;t exist, no outdated code generations.

## 📚 Adding Projects

Check out our [project addition guide](./docs/adding-projects.md) to learn how to add (or update) your favorite libraries to Context7.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js &gt;= v18.0.0
- Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop or another MCP Client

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Installing via Smithery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

To install Context7 MCP Server for any client automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@upstash/context7-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @upstash/context7-mcp --client &lt;CLIENT_NAME&gt; --key &lt;YOUR_SMITHERY_KEY&gt;
```

You can find your Smithery key in the [Smithery.ai webpage](https://smithery.ai/server/@upstash/context7-mcp).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Cursor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Go to: `Settings` -&gt; `Cursor Settings` -&gt; `MCP` -&gt; `Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. See [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Zed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

It can be installed via [Zed Extensions](https://zed.dev/extensions?query=Context7) or you can add this to your Zed `settings.json`. See [Zed Context Server docs](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/context-servers) for more info.

```json
{
  &quot;context_servers&quot;: {
    &quot;Context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: {
        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
      },
      &quot;settings&quot;: {}
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Gemini CLI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

See [Gemini CLI Configuration](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/configuration.md) for details.

1.  Open the Gemini CLI settings file. The location is `~/.gemini/settings.json` (where `~` is your home directory).
2.  Add the following to the `mcpServers` object in your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

If the `mcpServers` object does not exist, create it.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Claude Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Run this command. See [Claude Code MCP docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp) for more info.

#### Claude Code Remote Server Connection

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
```

Or using SSE transport:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport sse context7 https://mcp.context7.com/sse
```

#### Claude Code Local Server Connection

```sh
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Claude Desktop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Add this to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json` file. See [Claude Desktop MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for more info.

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;Context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Install in Cline&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;

You can easily install Context7 through the [Cline MCP Server Marketplace](https://cline.bot/mcp-marketplace) by following these instructions:

1. Open **Cline**.
1. Click the hamburger menu icon (☰) to enter the **MCP Servers** section.
2. Use the search bar within the **Marketplace** tab to find *Context7*.
3. Click the **Install** button.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in BoltAI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Open the &quot;Settings&quot; page of the app, navigate to &quot;Plugins,&quot; and enter the following JSON:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

Once saved, enter in the chat `get-library-docs` followed by your Context7 documentation ID (e.g., `get-library-docs /nuxt/ui`). More information is available on [BoltAI&#039;s Documentation site](https://docs.boltai.com/docs/plugins/mcp-servers). For BoltAI on iOS, [see this guide](https://docs.boltai.com/docs/boltai-mobile/mcp-servers).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using Docker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

If you prefer to run the MCP server in a Docker container:

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   First, create a `Dockerfile` in the project root (or anywhere you prefer):

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Click to see Dockerfile content&lt;/summary&gt;

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine

   WORKDIR /app

   # Install the latest version globally
   RUN npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp

   # Expose default port if needed (optional, depends on MCP client interaction)
   # EXPOSE 3000

   # Default command to run the server
   CMD [&quot;context7-mcp&quot;]
   ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   Then, build the image using a tag (e.g., `context7-mcp`). **Make sure Docker Desktop (or the Docker daemon) is running.** Run the following command in the same directory where you saved the `Dockerfile`:

   ```bash
   docker build -t context7-mcp .
   ```

2. **Configure Your MCP Client:**

   Update your MCP client&#039;s configuration to use the Docker command.

   _Example for a cline_mcp_settings.json:_

   ```json
   {
     &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
       &quot;Сontext7&quot;: {
         &quot;autoApprove&quot;: [],
         &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
         &quot;timeout&quot;: 60,
         &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
         &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;run&quot;, &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;--rm&quot;, &quot;context7-mcp&quot;],
         &quot;transportType&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   _Note: This is an example configuration. Please refer to the specific examples for your MCP client (like Cursor, VS Code, etc.) earlier in this README to adapt the structure (e.g., `mcpServers` vs `servers`). Also, ensure the image name in `args` matches the tag used during the `docker build` command._

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Windows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The configuration on Windows is slightly different compared to Linux or macOS (_`Cline` is used in the example_). The same principle applies to other editors; refer to the configuration of `command` and `args`.

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;github.com/upstash/context7-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;cmd&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/c&quot;, &quot;npx&quot;, &quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp@latest&quot;],
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;autoApprove&quot;: []
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Augment Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

To configure Context7 MCP in Augment Code, you can use either the graphical interface or manual configuration.

### **A. Using the Augment Code UI**

1. Click the hamburger menu.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Navigate to the **Tools** section.
4. Click the **+ Add MCP** button.
5. Enter the following command:

   ```
   npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
   ```

6. Name the MCP: **Context7**.
7. Click the **Add** button.

Once the MCP server is added, you can start using Context7&#039;s up-to-date code documentation features directly within Augment Code.

---

### **B. Manual Configuration**

1. Press Cmd/Ctrl Shift P or go to the hamburger menu in the Augment panel
2. Select Edit Settings
3. Under Advanced, click Edit in settings.json
4. Add the server configuration to the `mcpServers` array in the `augment.advanced` object

&quot;augment.advanced&quot;: {
&quot;mcpServers&quot;: [
{
&quot;name&quot;: &quot;context7&quot;,
&quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
&quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
}
]
}

Once the MCP server is added, restart your editor. If you receive any errors, check the syntax to make sure closing brackets or commas are not missing.

&lt;/details&gt;

## 🔨 Available Tools

Context7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:

- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.

  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for

- `get-library-docs`: Fetches documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `context7CompatibleLibraryID` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)
  - `topic` (optional): Focus the docs on a specific topic (e.g., &quot;routing&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;)
  - `tokens` (optional, default 10000): Max number of tokens to return. Values less than the default value of 10000 are automatically increased to 10000.

## 🛟 Tips

### Add a Rule
&gt; If you don’t want to add `use context7` to every prompt, you can define a simple rule in your `.windsurfrules` file in Windsurf or from `Cursor Settings &gt; Rules` section in Cursor (or the equivalent in your MCP client) to auto-invoke Context7 on any code question:
&gt; ```toml
&gt; [[calls]]
&gt; match = &quot;when the user requests code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation&quot;
&gt; tool  = &quot;context7&quot;
&gt; ```
&gt; From then on you’ll get Context7’s docs in any related conversation without typing anything extra. You can add your use cases to the match part.

uBlock Origin (uBO) is a CPU and memory-efficient [wide-spectrum content blocker][Blocking] for Chromium and Firefox. It blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, annoying anti-blockers, malware sites, etc., by default using [EasyList][EasyList], [EasyPrivacy][EasyPrivacy], [Peter Lowe&#039;s Blocklist][Peter Lowe&#039;s Blocklist], [Online Malicious URL Blocklist][Malicious Blocklist], and uBO [filter lists][uBO Filters]. There are many other lists available to block even more. Hosts files are also supported. uBO uses the EasyList filter syntax and [extends][Extended Syntax] the syntax to work with custom rules and filters.

You may easily unselect any preselected filter lists if you think uBO blocks too much. For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only EasyList, ABP filters, and Acceptable Ads enabled by default.

It is important to note that using a blocker is **NOT** [theft]. Do not fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of `blocking = theft` is the criminalization of the inalienable right to privacy.

Ads, &quot;unintrusive&quot; or not, are just the visible portion of the privacy-invading means entering your browser when you visit most sites. **uBO&#039;s primary goal is to help users neutralize these privacy-invading methods** in a way that welcomes those users who do not wish to use more technical means.

Zoom images/videos on all your favorite websites (Facebook, Amazon, etc). Hover your mouse over any image on the [supported websites](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom/tree/master/plugins) and the extension will automatically enlarge the image to its full size, making sure that it still fits into the browser window.

This is an open-source version of the original HoverZoom extension, which was overrun by malware and deleted from the store. In this version all spyware has been removed, many bugs were fixed and new features were added. It doesn&#039;t collect any user data whatsoever.

Sometimes sites change design, and when it happens, the extension needs to be updated. Please report any issues with zooming not working by filing an issue on https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom/issues page.

&gt; **This extension will never be sold out, and it will never compromise users&#039; privacy.&lt;br&gt;
&gt; As a proof, please see [the list](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom/discussions/670) of all takeover offers I have received over the last few years.**

&gt; Please help with [localizing this extension](https://crowdin.com/project/hoverzoom) to the language you are familiar with!

# Betterfox
[about:config](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox) tweaks to enhance [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

## Made for everyday browsing
[Faster](https://medium.com/@mihirgrand/comparing-popular-firefox-forks-6fa83fdfdaad#:~:text=31%25%20more%20than%20vanilla%20Firefox), more private and secure — without using third-party code.

Betterfox is an opinionated preference list inspired by the [law of diminishing returns](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1206/1*lcOcxriV_II_lZuXQYLoXg.jpeg) and the [minimum effective dose](https://medium.com/the-mission/less-is-more-the-minimum-effective-dose-e6d56625931e).

## Required reading
0) Create a [backup profile](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Backup).
1) Download the user.js file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/main/user.js) (Right click &gt; `Save Link As…`).
2) Review both [Common Overrides](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Common-Overrides) and [Optional Hardening](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Optional-Hardening) to make any necessary changes.
3) Open Firefox. In the URL bar, type `about:profiles` and press **Enter**.
4) For the profile you want to use, click **Open Folder** in the **Root Directory** section.
5) Move the `user.js` file into the folder.

*After restarting Firefox:*
1) Get an **ad blocker** like [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/ublock-origin-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ad-blocker/) with our [recommended filters](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists#guidelines).
2) Enable **DNS-level protection** with your chosen [provider](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Optional-Hardening#secure-dns) to further protect against security threats, ads, and trackers.

## Simple goals
1) **Minimalism:** get what isn&#039;t needed out of the way
2) **Efficiency:** unleash Firefox&#039;s ability to be fast and performant
3) **Privacy:** protect your data without causing site breakage

## Simple configs

`Fastfox`, `Securefox`, `Peskyfox`, and `Smoothfox` are guides to settings within Firefox.

The `user.js` — a configuration file that controls Firefox settings — is curated from these guides.

| List      | Description |
|:---------:|-------------|
| [Fastfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/main/Fastfox.js)   | Increase Firefox&#039;s browsing speed. Give Chrome a run for its money!|
| [Securefox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/main/Securefox.js) | Protect user data without causing site breakage. |
| [Peskyfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/main/Peskyfox.js)  | Provide a clean, distraction-free browsing experience. |
| [Smoothfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/main/Smoothfox.js) | Get Edge-like smooth scrolling on your favorite browser — or choose something more your style. |
| [user.js](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/main/user.js) | All the essentials. None of the breakage. This is your `user.js`. |
