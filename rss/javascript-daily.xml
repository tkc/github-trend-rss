            <h2>README</h2><pre>#### It&#039;s a bird, it&#039;s a plane, it&#039;s... a self-hosted, pi-hole esque, DNS resolver

_serverless-dns_ is a Pi-Hole esque [content-blocking](https://github.com/serverless-dns/blocklists), serverless, stub DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT) resolver. Runs out-of-the-box on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev), [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy), [Fastly Compute@Edge](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute), and [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). Free tiers of all these services should be enough to cover 10 to 20 devices worth of DNS traffic per month.

### The RethinkDNS resolver

RethinkDNS runs `serverless-dns` in production at these endpoints:

# run serverless-dns on Cloudflare Workers (cli)
# Make sure to setup Wrangler first:
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/authentication
./run w

# profile wrangler with Chrome DevTools
# blog.cloudflare.com/profiling-your-workers-with-wrangler
```

#### Code style

Commits on this repository enforces the Google JavaScript style guide (ref: [.eslintrc.cjs](.eslintrc.cjs)).
A git `pre-commit` hook that runs linter (eslint) and formatter (prettier) on `.js` files. Use `git commit --no-verify`
to bypass this hook.

Pull requests are also checked for code style violations and fixed automatically where possible.

#### Env vars

Configure [`env.js`](src/core/env.js) if you need to tweak the defaults.
For Cloudflare Workers, setup env vars in [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml), instead.
For Fastly Compute@Edge, setup env vars in [`fastly.toml`](fastly.toml), instead.

#### Request flow

1. The request/response flow: client &lt;-&gt; `src/server-[node|workers|deno]` &lt;-&gt; [`doh.js`](src/core/doh.js) &lt;-&gt; [`plugin.js`](src/core/plugin.js)
2. The `plugin.js` flow: `user-op.js` -&gt; `cache-resolver.js` -&gt; `cc.js` -&gt; `resolver.js`

#### Auth

serverless-dns supports authentication with an *alpha-numeric* bearer token for both DoH and DoT. For a token, `msg-key` (secret), append the output of `hex(hmac-sha256(msg-key|domain.tld), msg)` to `ACCESS_KEYS` env var in csv format. Note: `msg` is currently fixed to `sdns-public-auth-info`.

1. DoH: place the `msg-key` at the end of the blockstamp, like so:
`1:1:4AIggAABEGAgAA:&lt;msg-key&gt;` (here, `1` is the version, `1:4AIggAABEGAgAA`
is the blockstamp, `&lt;msg-key&gt;` is the auth secret, and `:` is the delimiter).
2. DoT: place the `msg-key` at the end of the SNI (domain-name) containing the blockstamp:
`1-4abcbaaaaeigaiaa-&lt;msg-key&gt;` (here `1` is the version, `4abcbaaaaeigaiaa`
is the blockstamp, `&lt;msg-key&gt;` is the auth secret, and `-` is the delimeter).

If the intention is to use auth with DoT too, keep `msg-key` shorter (8 to 24 chars), since subdomains may only be 63 chars long in total.

You can generate the access keys for your fork from `max.rethinkdns.com`, like so:
```bash
msgkey=&quot;ShortAlphanumericSecret&quot;
domain=&quot;my-serverless-dns-domain.tld&quot;
curl &#039;https://max.rethinkdns.com/genaccesskey?key=&#039;&quot;$msgkey&quot;&#039;&amp;dom=&#039;&quot;$domain&quot;
# output
# {&quot;accesskey&quot;:[&quot;my-serverless-dns-domain.tld|deadbeefd3adb33fa2bb33fd3eadf084beef3b152beefdead49bbb2b33fdead83d3adbeefdeadb33f&quot;],&quot;context&quot;:&quot;sdns-public-auth-info&quot;}
```

#### Logs and Analytics

serverless-dns can be setup to upload logs via Cloudflare *Logpush*.

0. Setup a *Logpush* job:
    ```bash
    CF_ACCOUNT_ID=&lt;hex-cloudflare-account-id&gt;
    CF_API_KEY=&lt;api-key-with-logs-edit-permission-at-account-level&gt;
    R2_BUCKET=&lt;r2-bucket-name&gt;
    R2_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;r2-access-key-for-the-bucket&gt;
    R2_SECRET_KEY=&lt;r2-secret-key-with-read-write-permissions&gt;
    # optional, setup a filter such that only logs form this worker ends up being pushed; but if you
    # do not need a filter on Worker name (script-name), edit the &quot;filter&quot; field below accordingly.
    SCRIPT_NAME=&lt;name-of-the-worker-as-in-wrangler-toml&gt;
    # for more options, ref: developers.cloudflare.com/logs/get-started/api-configuration
    # Logpush API with cURL: developers.cloudflare.com/logs/tutorials/examples/example-logpush-curl
    # Available Logpull fields: developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/workers_trace_events
    curl -s -X POST &quot;https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${CF_ACCOUNT_ID}/logpush/jobs&quot; \
        -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer ${CF_API_KEY}&quot; \
        -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
        -d &#039;{
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;dns-logpush&quot;,
            &quot;logpull_options&quot;: &quot;fields=EventTimestampMs,Outcome,Logs,ScriptName&amp;timestamps=rfc3339&quot;,
            &quot;destination_conf&quot;: &quot;r2://&#039;&quot;$R2_BUCKET&quot;&#039;/{DATE}?access-key-id=&#039;&quot;${R2_ACCESS_KEY}&quot;&#039;&amp;secret-access-key=&#039;&quot;${R2_SECRET_KEY}&quot;&#039;&amp;account-id=&#039;&quot;{$CF_ACCOUNT_ID}&quot;&#039;,
            &quot;dataset&quot;: &quot;workers_trace_events&quot;,
            &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;where\&quot;:{\&quot;and\&quot;:[{\&quot;key\&quot;:\&quot;ScriptName\&quot;,\&quot;operator\&quot;:\&quot;contains\&quot;,\&quot;value\&quot;:\&quot;&#039;&quot;${SCRIPT_NAME}&quot;&#039;\&quot;},{\&quot;key\&quot;:\&quot;Outcome\&quot;,\&quot;operator\&quot;:\&quot;eq\&quot;,\&quot;value\&quot;:\&quot;ok\&quot;}]}}&quot;,
            &quot;enabled&quot;: true,
            &quot;frequency&quot;: &quot;low&quot;
        }&#039;
    ```
1. Set `wrangler.toml` property `logpush = true`, which enables *Logpush*.
2. (Optional) env var `LOG_LEVEL = &quot;logpush&quot;`, which raises the log-level such that only *request* and error logs are emitted.
3. (Optional) Set env var `LOGPUSH_SRC = &quot;csv,of,subdomains&quot;`, which makes [`log-pusher.js`](./src/plugins/observability/log-pusher.js) emit *request* logs only if Workers `hostname` contains one of the subdomains.

Logs published to R2 can be retrieved either using [R2 Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-access/workers-api/workers-api-usage), the [R2 API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-access/s3-api/api), or the [Logpush API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/r2-log-retrieval).

Workers Analytics, if enabled, is pushed against a log-key, `lid`, which if unspecified is set to hostname of the serverless deployment with periods, `.`, replaced with underscores, `_`. Auth must be setup when querying for Analytics via the API which returns a json; ex: `https://max.rethinkdns.com/1:&lt;optional-stamp&gt;:&lt;msg-key&gt;/analytics?t=&lt;time-interval-in-mins&gt;&amp;f=&lt;field-name&gt;`. Possible `fields` are `ip` (client ip), `qname` (dns query name), `region` (resolver region), `qtype` (dns query type), `dom` (top-level domains), `ansip` (dns answer ips), and `cc` (ans ip country codes).

Log capture and analytics isn&#039;t yet implemented for Fly and Deno Deploy.

----

#### A note about runtimes

Deno Deploy (cloud) and Deno (the runtime) do not expose the same API surface (for example, Deno Deploy only
supports HTTP/S server-listeners; whereas, Deno suports raw TCP/UDP/TLS in addition to plain HTTP and HTTP/S).

Except on Node, `serverless-dns` uses DoH upstreams defined by env vars, `CF_DNS_RESOLVER_URL` / `CF_DNS_RESOLVER_URL_2`.
On Node, the default DNS upstream is `1.1.1.2` ([ref](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/15f628460/src/commons/dnsutil.js#L28)) or the recursive DNS resolver at `fdaa::3` when running on Fly.io.

The entrypoints for Node and Deno are [`src/server-node.js`](src/server-node.js), [`src/server-deno.ts`](src/server-deno.ts) respectively,
and both listen for TCP-over-TLS, HTTP/S connections; whereas, the entrypoint for Cloudflare Workers, which only listens over HTTP (cli) or
over HTTP/S (prod), is [`src/server-workers.js`](src/server-workers.js); and for Fastly its [`src/server-fastly.js`](src/server-fastly.js).

Local (non-prod) setups on Node, `key` (private) and `cert` (public chain) files, by default, are read from
paths defined in env vars, `TLS_KEY_PATH` and `TLS_CRT_PATH`.

Whilst for prod setup on Node (on Fly.io), either `TLS_OFFLOAD` must be set to `true` or `key` and `cert` _must_ be
_base64_ encoded in env var `TLS_CERTKEY` ([ref](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/f57c579/src/core/node/config.js#L61-L92)), like so:

```bash
# EITHER: offload tls to fly.io and set tls_offload to true
TLS_OFFLOAD=&quot;true&quot;
# OR: base64 representation of both key (private) and cert (public chain)
TLS_CERTKEY=&quot;KEY=b64_key_content\nCRT=b64_cert_content&quot;
```

For Deno, `key` and `cert` files are read from paths defined in env vars, `TLS_KEY_PATH` and `TLS_CRT_PATH` ([ref](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/270d1a3c/src/server-deno.ts#L32-L35)).

_Process_ bringup is different for each of these runtimes: For Node, [`src/core/node/config.js`](src/core/node/config.js) governs the _bringup_;
while for Deno, it is [`src/core/deno/config.ts`](src/core/deno/config.ts), and for Workers it is [`src/core/workers/config.js`](src/core/workers/config.js).
[`src/system.js`](src/system.js) pub-sub co-ordinates the _bringup_ phase among various modules.

On Node and Deno, in-process DNS caching is backed by [`@serverless-dns/lfu-cache`](https://github.com/serverless-dns/lfu-cache); Cloudflare Workers is backed by both [Cache Web API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache) and
in-process lfu caches. To disable caching altogether on all three platfroms, set env var, `PROFILE_DNS_RESOLVES=true`.

#### Cloud

Cloudflare Workers, and Deno Deploy are ephemeral, as in, the &quot;process&quot; that serves client requests is not long-lived,
and in fact, two back-to-back requests may be served by two different [_isolates_](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works) (&quot;processes&quot;). Fastly Compute@Edge is the also ephemeral but does not use isolates, instead Fastly creates and destroys a [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) sandbox for each request. Resolver on Fly.io, running Node, is backed by [persistent VMs](https://fly.io/blog/docker-without-docker/) and is hence longer-lived,
like traditional &quot;serverfull&quot; environments.

For Deno Deploy, the code-base is bundled up in a single javascript file with `deno bundle` and then handed off
to Deno.com.

Cloudflare Workers build-time and runtime configurations are defined in [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml).
[Webpack5 bundles the files](webpack.config.cjs) in an ESM module which is then uploaded to Cloudflare by _Wrangler_.

Fastly Compute@Edge build-time and runtime configurations are defined in [`fastly.toml`](fastly.toml).
[Webpack5 bundles the files](webpack.fastly.cjs) in an ESM module which is then compiled to WASM by `npx js-compute-runtime`
and subsequently packaged and published to Fastly Compute@Edge with the _Fastly CLI_.

For Fly.io, which runs Node, the runtime directives are defined in [`fly.toml`](fly.toml) (used by `dev` and `live` deployment-types),
while deploy directives are in [`node.Dockerfile`](node.Dockerfile). [`flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl) accordingly sets
up `serverless-dns` on Fly.io&#039;s infrastructure.

```bash
# build and deploy for cloudflare workers.dev
npm run build
# usually, env-name is prod
npx wrangler publish [-e &lt;env-name&gt;]

# bundle, build, and deploy for fastly compute@edge
# developer.fastly.com/reference/cli/compute/publish
fastly compute publish

# build and deploy to fly.io
npm run build:fly
flyctl deploy --dockerfile node.Dockerfile --config &lt;fly.toml&gt; [-a &lt;app-name&gt;] [--image-label &lt;some-uniq-label&gt;]
```

For deploys offloading TLS termination to Fly.io (`B1` deployment-type), the runtime directives are instead defined in
[`fly.tls.toml`](fly.tls.toml), which sets up HTTP2 Cleartext and HTTP/1.1 on port `443`, and DNS over TCP on port `853`.

### Blocklists

190+ blocklists are compressed in a _Succinct Radix Trie_ ([based on Steve Hanov&#039;s impl](https://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=120)) with modifications
to speed up string search ([`lookup`](https://github.com/serverless-dns/trie/blob/965007a5c/src/ftrie.js#L378-L484)) at the expense of &quot;succintness&quot;. The blocklists are versioned
with unix timestamp (defined in `src/basicconfig.json` downloaded by [`pre.sh`](src/build/pre.sh)), which is generated once every week, but we&#039;d like to generate &#039;em daily / hourly,
if possible [see](https://github.com/serverless-dns/blocklists/issues/19)), and hosted on Cloudflare R2 (env var: `CF_BLOCKLIST_URL`).

`serverless-dns` downloads [3 blocklist files](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/15f62846/src/core/node/blocklists.js#L14-L16)
required to setup the radix-trie during runtime bring-up or, downloads them [lazily](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/02f9e5bf/src/plugins/dns-op/resolver.js#L167),
when serving a DNS request.

`serverless-dns` compiles around ~13M entries (as of Jan 2023) from around 190+ blocklists. These are defined in the [serverless-dns/blocklists](https://github.com/serverless-dns/blocklists) repository.

## Usage

Here&#039;s a super-simple Hello World example - a spinning cube!

```js
import * as pc from &#039;playcanvas&#039;;

const canvas = document.createElement(&#039;canvas&#039;);
document.body.appendChild(canvas);

const app = new pc.Application(canvas);

// fill the available space at full resolution
app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW);
app.setCanvasResolution(pc.RESOLUTION_AUTO);

// ensure canvas is resized when window changes size
window.addEventListener(&#039;resize&#039;, () =&gt; app.resizeCanvas());

// create box entity
const box = new pc.Entity(&#039;cube&#039;);
box.addComponent(&#039;model&#039;, {
  type: &#039;box&#039;
});
app.root.addChild(box);

// create camera entity
const camera = new pc.Entity(&#039;camera&#039;);
camera.addComponent(&#039;camera&#039;, {
  clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
});
app.root.addChild(camera);
camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);

// create directional light entity
const light = new pc.Entity(&#039;light&#039;);
light.addComponent(&#039;light&#039;);
app.root.addChild(light);
light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

// rotate the box according to the delta time since the last frame
app.on(&#039;update&#039;, dt =&gt; box.rotate(10 * dt, 20 * dt, 30 * dt));

app.start();
```

[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) is a comprehensive library of React components that features our independent implementation of Google&#039;s [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/design/introduction/) system.
It&#039;s trusted by some of the world&#039;s greatest product teams because it&#039;s been rigorously battle-tested through more than a decade of development by thousands of open-source contributors.

Material UI&#039;s core functionality is extended by [MUI X](https://github.com/mui/mui-x), a suite of complex components for advanced use cases.

## Joy UI

This repository also contains Joy UI, an experimental component library that implements our own in-house Joy Design.
Joy UI is in beta and _development is currently on hold_.
When starting a new project from scratch, we recommend Material UI over Joy UI because we can guarantee ongoing support.

Keep in mind that the maintainers are primarily focused on other projects and may not be able to respond in a timely manner to issues or pull requests related to Joy UI.

# Introduction

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) designed to teach web
application security lessons.

This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The
exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and
penetration testing techniques.

**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
this program.*  WebGoat&#039;s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
the exposure.

**WARNING 2:** *This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
first thing that all hackers claim.*

# Installation instructions:

For more details check [the Contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 1. Run using Docker

Already have a browser and ZAP and/or Burp installed on your machine in this case you can run the WebGoat image directly using Docker.

Every release is also published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/webgoat/webgoat).

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 webgoat/webgoat
```

For some lessons you need the container run in the same timezone. For this you can set the TZ environment variable.
E.g.

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

If you want to use OWASP ZAP or another proxy, you can no longer use 127.0.0.1 or localhost. but
you can use custom host entries. For example:

```shell
127.0.0.1 www.webgoat.local www.webwolf.local
```

Then you can run the container with:

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e WEBGOAT_HOST=www.webgoat.local -e WEBWOLF_HOST=www.webwolf.local -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

Then visit http://www.webgoat.local:8080/WebGoat/ and http://www.webwolf.local:9090/WebWolf/

## 2. Run using Docker with complete Linux Desktop

Instead of installing tools locally we have a complete Docker image based on running a desktop in your browser. This way you only have to run a Docker image which will give you the best user experience.

```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 webgoat/webgoat-desktop
```

## 3. Standalone

Download the latest WebGoat release from [https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases)

```shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar
```

Click the link in the log to start WebGoat.

### 3.1 Running on a different port

If for some reason you want to run WebGoat on a different port, you can do so by adding the following parameter:

```shell
java -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar --webgoat.port=8001 --webwolf.port=8002
```

For a full overview of all the parameters you can use, please check the [WebGoat properties file](webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application-{webgoat, webwolf}.properties).

## 4. Run from the sources

### Prerequisites:

* Java 25
* Your favorite IDE
* Git, or Git support in your IDE

Open a command shell/window:

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:WebGoat/WebGoat.git
```

Now let&#039;s start by compiling the project.

```Shell
cd WebGoat
git checkout &lt;&lt;branch_name&gt;&gt;
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw clean install

# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd clean install

# Using docker or podman, you can than build the container locally
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t webgoat/webgoat
```

Now we are ready to run the project. WebGoat is using Spring Boot.

```Shell
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

```

... you should be running WebGoat on http://localhost:8080/WebGoat momentarily.

Note: The above link will redirect you to login page if you are not logged in. LogIn/Create account to proceed.

To change the IP address add the following variable to the `WebGoat/webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

```
server.address=x.x.x.x
```

## 4. Run with custom menu

For specialist only. There is a way to set up WebGoat with a personalized menu. You can leave out some menu categories or individual lessons by setting certain environment variables.

For instance running as a jar on a Linux/macOS it will look like this:

```Shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
export EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot;
export EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot;
java -jar target/webgoat-2023.8-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Or in a docker run it would (once this version is pushed into docker hub) look like this:

```Shell
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot; -e EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot; webgoat/webgoat
```

## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs that don&#039;t even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt in Cursor:

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies
and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache
JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM&#039;s context.

- 1️⃣ Write your prompt naturally
- 2️⃣ Tell the LLM to `use context7`
- 3️⃣ Get working code answers

No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don&#039;t exist, no outdated code generation.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This repository hosts the source code of Context7 MCP server. The supporting components — API backend, parsing engine, and crawling engine — are private and not part of this release.

## 📚 Adding Projects

        &quot;Accept&quot;: &quot;application/json, text/event-stream&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or, for a local server:

```json

```json
&quot;mcp&quot;: {
  &quot;context7&quot;: {
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;remote&quot;,
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://mcp.context7.com/mcp&quot;,
    &quot;headers&quot;: {
      &quot;CONTEXT7_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;
    },
    &quot;enabled&quot;: true
  }
}
```

#### Opencode Local Server Connection

      &quot;command&quot;: [&quot;npx&quot;, &quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;, &quot;--api-key&quot;, &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;],
      &quot;enabled&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in OpenAI Codex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

See [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) for more information.

Add the following configuration to your OpenAI Codex MCP server settings:

#### Local Server Connection

```toml
[mcp_servers.context7]
args = [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;, &quot;--api-key&quot;, &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;]
command = &quot;npx&quot;
startup_timeout_ms = 20_000
```

#### Remote Server Connection

```toml
[mcp_servers.context7]
url = &quot;https://mcp.context7.com/mcp&quot;
http_headers = { &quot;CONTEXT7_API_KEY&quot; = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot; }
```

&gt; Optional troubleshooting — only if you see startup &quot;request timed out&quot; or &quot;not found program&quot;. Most users can ignore this.
&gt;
&gt; - First try: increase `startup_timeout_ms` to `40_000` and retry.
&gt; - Windows quick fix (absolute `npx` path + explicit env):
&gt;
&gt; ```toml
&gt; [mcp_servers.context7]
&gt; command = &quot;C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\npx.cmd&quot;
&gt; args = [
&gt;   &quot;-y&quot;,
&gt;   &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;,
&gt;   &quot;--api-key&quot;,
&gt;   &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;
&gt; ]
&gt; env = { SystemRoot=&quot;C:\\Windows&quot;, APPDATA=&quot;C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Roaming&quot; }
&gt; startup_timeout_ms = 40_000
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; - macOS quick fix (use Node + installed package entry point):
&gt;
&gt; ```toml
&gt; [mcp_servers.context7]
&gt; command = &quot;/Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/node&quot;
&gt; args = [&quot;/Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/lib/node_modules/@upstash/context7-mcp/dist/index.js&quot;,
&gt;   &quot;--transport&quot;,
&gt;   &quot;stdio&quot;,
&gt;   &quot;--api-key&quot;,
&gt;   &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;
&gt; ]
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; Notes: Replace `yourname` with your OS username. Explicitly setting `APPDATA` and `SystemRoot` is essential because these are required by `npx` on Windows but not set by certain versions of OpenAI Codex mcp clients by default.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in JetBrains AI Assistant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

See [JetBrains AI Assistant Documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/configure-an-mcp-server.html) for more details.

  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;bunx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;, &quot;--api-key&quot;, &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Deno

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;deno&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--allow-env=NO_DEPRECATION,TRACE_DEPRECATION&quot;,
        &quot;--allow-net&quot;,
        &quot;npm:@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of over 10 years of iterative development and
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you&#039;re free to architect your code in the
way that you want.

## About This Repository

This repository is where HTML5-Boilerplate is authored. Some of the tools,
files and processes that you see here are solely for the _production_ of
HTML5 Boilerplate and are not _part_ of HTML5 Boilerplate. For one example, the
[gulpfile.mjs](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/main/gulpfile.mjs)
script is used to _build_ the project. It&#039;s not part of the project itself.

The project we publish is represented by the contents of the `/dist/`
folder. Everything else in this repository is used to author the project.

Think of it this way, in the same way that you don&#039;t clone [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core)
to create a Vue.js app, you don&#039;t need to clone this repository to start a new
site or app based on HTML5 Boilerplate.

So, if you&#039;re looking for a quick start template to build a website or
application, look at the options in the
[Quick Start](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate#quick-start) section of this document.

If you want to help us _improve_ HTML5 Boilerplate then you can start with the documentation [here](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), which includes steps to clone this repo in order to get it set up for development.

## Quick Start

Choose one of the following options:

- Using the [create-html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/create-html5-boilerplate)
  script, instantly fetch the latest npm published package (or any version
  available on npm) with `npx`, `npm init` or `yarn create` without having to
  install any dependencies. Running the following `npx` command installs the
  latest version into a folder called `new-site`

  ```bash
  npx create-html5-boilerplate new-site
  cd new-site
  npm install
  npm run start
  ```

- Using our new [Template Repository](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate-template)
  create a new GitHub repository based on the latest code from the main branch of HTML5
  Boilerplate.

- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install html5-boilerplate`
  or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add html5-boilerplate`. The resulting
  `node_modules/html5-boilerplate/dist` folder represents the latest version of
  the project for end users. Depending on what you want to use and how you want
  to use it, you may have to copy and paste the contents of that folder into
  your project directory.

- Download the latest stable release from
  [here](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/releases/download/v9.0.0/html5-boilerplate_v9.0.0.zip). This zip file is a
  snapshot of the `dist` folder. On Windows, Mac and from the file manager on
  Linux unzipping this folder will output to a folder named something like
  `html5-boilerplate_v9.0.0`. From the command-line, you will need to create a
  folder and unzip the contents into that folder.

  ```bash
  mkdir html5-boilerplate
  unzip html5-boilerplate*.zip -d html5-boilerplate
  ```

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; ℹ️ **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected
&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.

## Contributing

PDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors. To

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the &quot;Modern browsers&quot; version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools &gt; Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.
