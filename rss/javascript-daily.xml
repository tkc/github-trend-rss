# Worklenz React

This repository contains the React version of Worklenz with a Docker setup for easy development and deployment.

## Getting Started with Docker

The project includes a fully configured Docker setup with:
- Frontend React application
- Backend server
- PostgreSQL database
- MinIO for S3-compatible storage

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Worklenz/worklenz.git
cd worklenz
```

2. Start the Docker containers (choose one option):

**Option 1: Using the provided scripts (easiest)**
- On Windows:
  ```
  start.bat
  ```
- On Linux/macOS:
  ```bash
  ./start.sh
  ```

**Option 2: Using Docker Compose directly**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. The application will be available at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
   - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (login with minioadmin/minioadmin)

4. To stop the services (choose one option):

**Option 1: Using the provided scripts**
- On Windows:
  ```
  stop.bat
  ```
- On Linux/macOS:
  ```bash
  ./stop.sh
  ```

**Option 2: Using Docker Compose directly**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## MinIO Integration

The project uses MinIO as an S3-compatible object storage service, which provides an open-source alternative to AWS S3 for development and production.

### Working with MinIO

MinIO provides an S3-compatible API, so any code that works with S3 will work with MinIO by simply changing the endpoint URL. The backend has been configured to use MinIO by default, with no additional configuration required.

- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001
  - Username: minioadmin
  - Password: minioadmin

- **Default Bucket**: worklenz-bucket (created automatically when the containers start)

### Backend Storage Configuration

The backend is pre-configured to use MinIO with the following settings:

```javascript
// S3 credentials with MinIO defaults
export const REGION = process.env.AWS_REGION || &quot;us-east-1&quot;;
export const BUCKET = process.env.AWS_BUCKET || &quot;worklenz-bucket&quot;;
export const S3_URL = process.env.S3_URL || &quot;http://minio:9000/worklenz-bucket&quot;;
export const S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || &quot;minioadmin&quot;;
export const S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || &quot;minioadmin&quot;;
```

The S3 client is initialized with special MinIO configuration:

```javascript
const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: REGION,
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID || &quot;&quot;,
    secretAccessKey: S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || &quot;&quot;,
  },
  endpoint: getEndpointFromUrl(), // Extracts endpoint from S3_URL
  forcePathStyle: true, // Required for MinIO
});
```

### Environment Configuration

The `.env` file includes the necessary configuration for using MinIO:

```
STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=worklenz-bucket
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
S3_URL=http://minio:9000
```

When the backend service starts, it will use these environment variables to connect to MinIO for file storage.

## Development

For development, you can use the provided Docker setup which includes all necessary dependencies. The code will be running inside containers, but you can still edit files locally and see changes reflected in real-time.

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Update the `.env` file with production settings
2. Build custom Docker images or use the provided ones
3. Deploy using Docker Compose or a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes

For MinIO in production, consider:
- Setting up proper credentials (change default minioadmin/minioadmin)
- Configuring persistent storage
- Setting up proper networking and access controls
- Using multiple MinIO instances for high availability

&lt;!--START-SECTION:setup--&gt;

### Section 1: Setup

#### Prerequisites

You can use this cheatsheet for reference at any skill level, but basic understanding of React and TypeScript is assumed. Here is a list of prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of [React](https://react.dev/).
- Familiarity with [TypeScript Basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html) and [Everyday Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html).

In the cheatsheet we assume you are using the latest versions of React and TypeScript.

#### React and TypeScript starter kits

React has documentation for [how to start a new React project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) with some of the most popular frameworks. Here&#039;s how to start them with TypeScript:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript): `npx create-next-app@latest --ts`
- [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/tutorials/blog): `npx create-remix@latest`
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/custom-configuration/typescript/): `npm init gatsby --ts`
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/): `npx create-expo-app -t with-typescript`

#### Try React and TypeScript online

There are some tools that let you run React and TypeScript online, which can be helpful for debugging or making sharable reproductions.

- [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?target=8&amp;jsx=4#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgVwM4FMDKMCGN0A0KGAogGZnoDG8AvnGVBCHAORTo42sDcAsAChB6AB6RYcKhAB2qeAGEIyafihwAvHAAUASg0A+RILiSZcuAG0pymEQwxFNgLobiWXPi0AGHfyECTNHRyShotXQMjAJM4ABMIKmQQdBUAOhhgGAAbdFcAAwBNJUks4CoAa3RYuAASBGsVegzk1Dy-E1pfQWM4DhhkKGltHpMAHn0RmNGwfSLkErLK6vqlRrhm9FRRgHoZybGAI2QYGBk4GXlSivUECPVDe0cVLQb4AGo4AEYdWgnomJil0WcGS+zgOyOJxkfwBOxhcC6AlogiAA)

&lt;!--END-SECTION:setup--&gt;

### Section 2: Getting Started

&lt;!--START-SECTION:function-components--&gt;

#### Function Components

These can be written as normal functions that take a `props` argument and return a JSX element.

```tsx
// Declaring type of props - see &quot;Typing Component Props&quot; for more examples
type AppProps = {
  message: string;
}; /* use `interface` if exporting so that consumers can extend */

// Easiest way to declare a Function Component; return type is inferred.
const App = ({ message }: AppProps) =&gt; &lt;div&gt;{message}&lt;/div&gt;;

// You can choose to annotate the return type so an error is raised if you accidentally return some other type
const App = ({ message }: AppProps): React.JSX.Element =&gt; &lt;div&gt;{message}&lt;/div&gt;;

// You can also inline the type declaration; eliminates naming the prop types, but looks repetitive
const App = ({ message }: { message: string }) =&gt; &lt;div&gt;{message}&lt;/div&gt;;

// Alternatively, you can use `React.FunctionComponent` (or `React.FC`), if you prefer.
// With latest React types and TypeScript 5.1. it&#039;s mostly a stylistic choice, otherwise discouraged.
const App: React.FunctionComponent&lt;{ message: string }&gt; = ({ message }) =&gt; (
  &lt;div&gt;{message}&lt;/div&gt;
);
// or
const App: React.FC&lt;AppProps&gt; = ({ message }) =&gt; &lt;div&gt;{message}&lt;/div&gt;;
```

&gt; Tip: You might use [Paul Shen&#039;s VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulshen.paul-typescript-toolkit) to automate the type destructure declaration (incl a [keyboard shortcut](https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1392915279466745857?s=20)).

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why is &lt;code&gt;React.FC&lt;/code&gt; not needed? What about &lt;code&gt;React.FunctionComponent&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;React.VoidFunctionComponent&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

You may see this in many React+TypeScript codebases:

```tsx
const App: React.FunctionComponent&lt;{ message: string }&gt; = ({ message }) =&gt; (
  &lt;div&gt;{message}&lt;/div&gt;
);
```

However, the general consensus today is that `React.FunctionComponent` (or the shorthand `React.FC`) is not needed. If you&#039;re still using React 17 or TypeScript lower than 5.1, it is even [discouraged](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/8177). This is a nuanced opinion of course, but if you agree and want to remove `React.FC` from your codebase, you can use [this jscodeshift codemod](https://github.com/gndelia/codemod-replace-react-fc-typescript).

Some differences from the &quot;normal function&quot; version:

- `React.FunctionComponent` is explicit about the return type, while the normal function version is implicit (or else needs additional annotation).

- It provides typechecking and autocomplete for static properties like `displayName`, `propTypes`, and `defaultProps`.

  - Note that there are some known issues using `defaultProps` with `React.FunctionComponent`. See [this issue for details](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react/issues/87). We maintain a separate `defaultProps` section you can also look up.

- Before the [React 18 type updates](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/56210), `React.FunctionComponent` provided an implicit definition of `children` (see below), which was heavily debated and is one of the reasons [`React.FC` was removed from the Create React App TypeScript template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/8177).

```tsx
// before React 18 types
const Title: React.FunctionComponent&lt;{ title: string }&gt; = ({
  children,
  title,
}) =&gt; &lt;div title={title}&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;;
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;(Deprecated)&lt;b&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;React.VoidFunctionComponent&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;React.VFC&lt;/code&gt; instead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

In [@types/react 16.9.48](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/46643), the `React.VoidFunctionComponent` or `React.VFC` type was added for typing `children` explicitly.
However, please be aware that `React.VFC` and `React.VoidFunctionComponent` were deprecated in React 18 (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/59882), so this interim solution is no longer necessary or recommended in React 18+.

Please use regular function components or `React.FC` instead.

```ts
type Props = { foo: string };

// OK now, in future, error
const FunctionComponent: React.FunctionComponent&lt;Props&gt; = ({
  foo,
  children,
}: Props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {foo} {children}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  ); // OK
};

// Error now, in future, deprecated
const VoidFunctionComponent: React.VoidFunctionComponent&lt;Props&gt; = ({
  foo,
  children,
}) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {foo}
      {children}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

&lt;/details&gt;

- _In the future_, it may automatically mark props as `readonly`, though that&#039;s a moot point if the props object is destructured in the parameter list.

In most cases it makes very little difference which syntax is used, but you may prefer the more explicit nature of `React.FunctionComponent`.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;!--END-SECTION:function-components--&gt;

&lt;!--START-SECTION:hooks--&gt;

#### Hooks

Hooks are [supported in `@types/react` from v16.8 up](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/a05cc538a42243c632f054e42eab483ebf1560ab/types/react/index.d.ts#L800-L1031).

#### useState

Type inference works very well for simple values:

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useState(false);
// `state` is inferred to be a boolean
// `setState` only takes booleans
```

See also the [Using Inferred Types](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/troubleshooting/types/#using-inferred-types) section if you need to use a complex type that you&#039;ve relied on inference for.

However, many hooks are initialized with null-ish default values, and you may wonder how to provide types. Explicitly declare the type, and use a union type:

```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState&lt;User | null&gt;(null);

// later...
setUser(newUser);
```

You can also use type assertions if a state is initialized soon after setup and always has a value after:

```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState&lt;User&gt;({} as User);

// later...
setUser(newUser);
```

This temporarily &quot;lies&quot; to the TypeScript compiler that `{}` is of type `User`. You should follow up by setting the `user` state — if you don&#039;t, the rest of your code may rely on the fact that `user` is of type `User` and that may lead to runtime errors.

#### useCallback

You can type the `useCallback` just like any other function.

```ts
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  (param1: string, param2: number) =&gt; {
    console.log(param1, param2)
    return { ok: true }
  },
  [...],
);
/**
 * VSCode will show the following type:
 * const memoizedCallback:
 *  (param1: string, param2: number) =&gt; { ok: boolean }
 */
```

Note that for React &lt; 18, the function signature of `useCallback` typed arguments as `any[]` by default:

```ts
function useCallback&lt;T extends (...args: any[]) =&gt; any&gt;(
  callback: T,
  deps: DependencyList
): T;
```

In React &gt;= 18, the function signature of `useCallback` changed to the following:

```ts
function useCallback&lt;T extends Function&gt;(callback: T, deps: DependencyList): T;
```

Therefore, the following code will yield &quot;`Parameter &#039;e&#039; implicitly has an &#039;any&#039; type.`&quot; error in React &gt;= 18, but not &lt;17.

```ts
// @ts-expect-error Parameter &#039;e&#039; implicitly has &#039;any&#039; type.
useCallback((e) =&gt; {}, []);
// Explicit &#039;any&#039; type.
useCallback((e: any) =&gt; {}, []);
```

#### useReducer

You can use [Discriminated Unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-func.html#discriminated-unions) for reducer actions. Don&#039;t forget to define the return type of reducer, otherwise TypeScript will infer it.

```tsx
import { useReducer } from &quot;react&quot;;

const initialState = { count: 0 };

type ACTIONTYPE =
  | { type: &quot;increment&quot;; payload: number }
  | { type: &quot;decrement&quot;; payload: string };

function reducer(state: typeof initialState, action: ACTIONTYPE) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case &quot;increment&quot;:
      return { count: state.count + action.payload };
    case &quot;decrement&quot;:
      return { count: state.count - Number(action.payload) };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      Count: {state.count}
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({ type: &quot;decrement&quot;, payload: &quot;5&quot; })}&gt;
        -
      &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({ type: &quot;increment&quot;, payload: 5 })}&gt;
        +
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
```

[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/leaningtech/webvm)](https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/issues)

This repository hosts the source code for [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io), a Linux virtual machine that runs in your browser.

Try out the new Alpine / Xorg / i3 graphical environment: [https://webvm.io/alpine.html](https://webvm.io/alpine.html)

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/welcome_to_WebVM_alpine_2024.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

WebVM is a server-less virtual environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. It&#039;s designed to be Linux ABI-compatible. It runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.

WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser. CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator. 

# Enable networking

Modern browsers do not provide APIs to directly use TCP or UDP. WebVM provides networking support by integrating with Tailscale, a VPN network that supports WebSockets as a transport layer.

- Open the &quot;Networking&quot; panel from the side-bar
- Click &quot;Connect to Tailscale&quot; from the panel
- Log in to Tailscale (create an account if you don&#039;t have one)
- Click &quot;Connect&quot; when prompted by Tailscale
- If you are unfamiliar with Tailscale or would like additional information see [WebVM and Tailscale](/docs/Tailscale.md).

# Fork, deploy, customize

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fork_deploy_instructions.gif&quot; alt=&quot;deploy_instructions_gif&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

- Fork the repository.
- Enable Github pages in settings.
	- Click on `Settings`.
	- Go to the `Pages` section.
	- Select `Github Actions` as the source.
        - If you are using a custom domain, ensure `Enforce HTTPS` is enabled. 
- Run the workflow.
	- Click on `Actions`.
	- Accept the prompt. This is required only once to enable Actions for your fork.
	- Click on the workflow named `Deploy`.
	- Click `Run workflow` and then once more `Run workflow` in the menu.
- After a few seconds a new `Deploy` workflow will start, click on it to see details.
- After the workflow completes, which takes a few minutes, it will show the URL below the `deploy_to_github_pages` job.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/result.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; &gt;

You can now customize `dockerfiles/debian_mini` to suit your needs, or make a new Dockerfile from scratch. Use the `Path to Dockerfile` workflow parameter to select it.

# Run WebVM locally with a custom Debian mini disk image

1. Clone the WebVM Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm.git
cd webvm
```

2. Download the Debian mini Ext2 image

	Run the following command to download the Debian mini Ext2 image:

	```sh
	wget &quot;https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/releases/download/ext2_image/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2&quot;
	```

	(*You can also build your own disk image by selecting the **&quot;Upload GitHub release&quot;** workflow option*)

3. Update the configuration file

	Edit `config_public_terminal.js` to reference your local disk image:

- Replace: 
	
	`&quot;wss://disks.webvm.io/debian_large_20230522_5044875331.ext2&quot;`
	
	With:
	
	`&quot;/disk-images/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2&quot;`

	(*Use an absolute or relative URL pointing to the disk image location.*)


- Replace `&quot;cloud&quot;` with the correct disk image type: `&quot;bytes&quot;`
	
4. Build WebVM

	Run the following commands to install dependencies and build WebVM:

	```sh
	npm install
	npm run build
	```

	The output will be placed in the `build` directory.

5. Configure Nginx

- Create a directory for the disk image:

	```sh
	mkdir disk-images
	mv debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2 disk-images/
	```

- Modify your `nginx.conf` file to serve the disk image. Add the following location block:

	```nginx
	location /disk-images/ {
        root .;
        autoindex on;
	}
	```

6. Start Nginx

	Run the following command to start Nginx:

	```sh
	nginx -p . -c nginx.conf
	```

	*Nginx will automatically serve the build directory.*

7. Access WebVM

	Open a browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.

	Enjoy your local WebVM!

# How to use Claude AI

To access Claude AI, you need an API key. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Create an account
- Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/login) and sign up with your e-mail. You&#039;ll receive a sign in link to the Anthropic Console. 

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/anthropic_signup.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

2. Get your API key
- Once logged in, navigate to **Get API keys**.
- Purchase the amount of credits you need. After completing the purchase, you&#039;ll be able to generate the key through the API console.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/anthropic_api_payment.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

3. Log in with your API key
- Navigate to your WebVM and hover over the robot icon. This will show the Claude AI Integration tab. For added convenience, you can click the pin button in the top right corner to keep the tab in place.
- You&#039;ll see a prompt where you can insert your Claude API key.
- Insert your key and press enter.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/insert_key.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

4. Start using Claude AI

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

***

Appium is an open-source automation framework that provides
[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)-based automation possibilities for a wide range of
different mobile, desktop and IoT platforms. Appium is modular and extensible, and supports multiple
programming languages, which means there is an entire ecosystem of related software:
* [__Drivers__](#drivers) add support for automating specific platforms
* [__Clients__](#clients) allow writing Appium tests in your programming language of choice
* [__Plugins__](#plugins) allow to further extend Appium functionality

## Migrating From Appium 1 to Appium 2

As of January 1st, 2022, the Appium team no longer maintains or supports Appium 1. All officially
supported platform drivers are only compatible with Appium 2.

__[Please read the Migration Guide](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/guides/migrating-1-to-2/) if you
are still using Appium 1.__

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; If you use Appium Desktop or Appium Server GUI, you will not be able to upgrade to Appium 2, as
both of these tools have been deprecated. Please use [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector)
in combination with a standalone Appium 2 server.

## Installation

Appium can be installed using `npm` (other package managers are not currently supported). Please
check the [installation docs](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/quickstart/install/) for the
system requirements and further information.

If upgrading from Appium 1, make sure Appium 1 is fully uninstalled (`npm uninstall -g appium`).
Unexpected errors might appear if this has not been done.

```bash
npm i -g appium
```

Note that this will only install the core Appium server, which cannot automate anything on its own.
Please install [drivers](#drivers) for your target platforms in order to automate them.

## Drivers

Appium supports app automation across a variety of platforms, like iOS, Android, macOS, Windows,
and more. Each platform is supported by one or more &quot;drivers&quot;, which know how to automate that
particular platform. You can find a full list of officially-supported and third-party drivers in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Drivers page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/drivers/).

Driver management is done using [Appium&#039;s Extension command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/extensions/):

```bash
# Install an official driver from npm (see documentation for a list of such drivers)
appium driver install &lt;driver-name&gt;
# Install any driver from npm
appium driver install --source=npm &lt;driver-name&gt;
# See documentation for installation from other sources

# List already installed drivers
appium driver list --installed
# Update a driver (it must be already installed)
# This will NOT update the major version, in order to prevent breaking changes
appium driver update &lt;driver-name&gt;
# Update a driver to the most recent version (may include breaking changes)
appium driver update &lt;driver-name&gt; --unsafe
# Uninstall a driver (it won&#039;t last forever, will it?)
appium driver uninstall &lt;driver-name&gt;
```

## Clients

Client libraries enable writing Appium tests in different programming languages. There are
officially-supported clients for Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET C#, as well as third-party clients
for other languages. You can find a full list of clients in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Clients page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/clients/).

## Plugins

Plugins allow you to extend server functionality without changing the server code. The main
difference between drivers and plugins is that the latter must be explicitly enabled on
Appium server startup (all installed drivers are enabled by default):

```bash
appium --use-plugins=&lt;plugin-name&gt;
```

You can find a full list of officially-supported and third-party plugins in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Plugins page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/plugins/).

Similarly to drivers, plugin management is also done using
[Appium&#039;s Extension command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/extensions/):

```bash
# Install an official plugin from npm (see documentation for a list of such plugins)
appium plugin install &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# Install any plugin from npm
appium plugin install --source=npm &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# See documentation for installation from other sources

# List already installed plugins
appium plugin list --installed
# Update a plugin (it must be already installed)
# This will NOT update the major version, in order to prevent breaking changes
appium plugin update &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# Update a plugin to the most recent version (may include breaking changes)
appium plugin update &lt;plugin-name&gt; --unsafe
# Uninstall a plugin
appium plugin uninstall &lt;plugin-name&gt;
```

## Server Command Line Interface

In order to start sending commands to the Appium server, it must be running on the URL and port
where your client library expects it to listen. [Appium&#039;s command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/args/)
is used to launch and configure the server:

```bash
# Start the server on the default host (0.0.0.0) and port (4723)
appium server
# You can also omit the &#039;server&#039; subcommand
appium
# Start the server on the given host, port and use a custom base path prefix (the default prefix is &#039;/&#039;)
appium --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9000 --base-path /wd/hub
```

Appium supports execution of parallel server processes, as well as parallel driver sessions within a
single server process. Refer the corresponding driver documentations regarding which mode is optimal
for the particular driver or whether it supports parallel sessions.

## Why Appium?

1. You usually don&#039;t have to recompile your app or modify it in any way, due to the use of standard
   automation APIs on all platforms.
2. You can write tests with your favorite dev tools using any WebDriver-compatible language such as
   Java, Python, Ruby and C#. There are also third party client implementations for other languages.
3. You can use any testing framework.
4. Some drivers like `xcuitest` and `uiautomator2` have built-in mobile web and hybrid app support.
   Within the same script, you can switch seamlessly between native app automation and webview
   automation, all using the WebDriver model that&#039;s already the standard for web automation.
5. You can run your automated tests locally and in a cloud. There are multiple cloud providers that
   support various Appium drivers (mostly targeting iOS and Android mobile automation).
6. [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector) can be used to visually inspect
   the page source of applications across different platforms, facilitating easier test development.

Investing in the [WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html) protocol means you
are betting on a single, free, and open protocol for testing that has become a web standard. Don&#039;t
lock yourself into a proprietary stack.

For example, if you use Apple&#039;s XCUITest library without Appium, you can only write tests using
Obj-C/Swift, and you can only run tests through Xcode. Similarly, with Google&#039;s UiAutomator or
Espresso, you can only write tests in Java/Kotlin. Appium opens up the possibility of true
cross-platform native app automation, for mobile and beyond!

If you are looking for a more comprehensive description of what this is all about, please read our
documentation on [How Does Appium Work?](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/intro/appium/).

## Demos

You can try Plyr in Codepen using our minimal templates: [HTML5 video](https://codepen.io/pen?template=bKeqpr), [HTML5 audio](https://codepen.io/pen?template=rKLywR), [YouTube](https://codepen.io/pen?template=GGqbbJ), [Vimeo](https://codepen.io/pen?template=bKeXNq). For Streaming we also have example integrations with: [Dash.js](https://codepen.io/pen?template=GRoogML), [Hls.js](https://codepen.io/pen?template=oyLKQb) and [Shaka Player](https://codepen.io/pen?template=ZRpzZO)

# Quick setup

## HTML

Plyr extends upon the standard [HTML5 media element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) markup so that&#039;s all you need for those types.

### HTML5 Video

```html
&lt;video id=&quot;player&quot; playsinline controls data-poster=&quot;/path/to/poster.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/video.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/video.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;!-- Captions are optional --&gt;
  &lt;track kind=&quot;captions&quot; label=&quot;English captions&quot; src=&quot;/path/to/captions.vtt&quot; srclang=&quot;en&quot; default /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
```

**Note**: The poster image should be specified using `data-poster`. This is to prevent it [being downloaded twice](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1531). If you&#039;re sure the image will be cached, you can still use the `poster` attribute for true progressive enhancement.

### HTML5 Audio

```html
&lt;audio id=&quot;player&quot; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/audio.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mp3&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/audio.ogg&quot; type=&quot;audio/ogg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
```

For YouTube and Vimeo players, Plyr uses progressive enhancement to enhance the default `&lt;iframe&gt;` embeds. Below are some examples. The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the embed responsive. You can add the `autoplay`, `loop`, `hl` (YouTube only) and `playsinline` (YouTube only) query parameters to the URL and they will be set as config options automatically. For YouTube, the `origin` should be updated to reflect the domain you&#039;re hosting the embed on, or you can opt to omit it.

### YouTube

We recommend [progressive enhancement](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) with the embedded players. You can elect to use an `&lt;iframe&gt;` as the source element (which Plyr will progressively enhance) or a bog standard `&lt;div&gt;` with two essential data attributes - `data-plyr-provider` and `data-plyr-embed-id`.

```html
&lt;div class=&quot;plyr__video-embed&quot; id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe
    src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTqVqk7FSmY?origin=https://plyr.io&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;playsinline=1&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot;
    allowfullscreen
    allowtransparency
    allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

_Note_: The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the player a responsive 16:9 (most common) iframe embed. When plyr itself kicks in, your custom `ratio` config option will be used.

Or the `&lt;div&gt;` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot; data-plyr-provider=&quot;youtube&quot; data-plyr-embed-id=&quot;bTqVqk7FSmY&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

_Note_: The `data-plyr-embed-id` can either be the video ID or URL for the media.

### Vimeo

Much the same as YouTube above.

```html
&lt;div class=&quot;plyr__video-embed&quot; id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe
    src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?loop=false&amp;amp;byline=false&amp;amp;portrait=false&amp;amp;title=false&amp;amp;speed=true&amp;amp;transparent=0&amp;amp;gesture=media&quot;
    allowfullscreen
    allowtransparency
    allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

Or the `&lt;div&gt;` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot; data-plyr-provider=&quot;vimeo&quot; data-plyr-embed-id=&quot;76979871&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

## JavaScript

You can use Plyr as an ES6 module as follows:

```js
import Plyr from &#039;plyr&#039;;

const player = new Plyr(&#039;#player&#039;);
```

Alternatively you can include the `plyr.js` script before the closing `&lt;/body&gt;` tag and then in your JS create a new instance of Plyr as below.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/plyr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const player = new Plyr(&#039;#player&#039;);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

See [initialising](#initializing) for more information on advanced setups.

You can use our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) for the JavaScript. There&#039;s 2 versions; one with and one without [polyfills](#polyfills). My recommendation would be to manage polyfills separately as part of your application but to make life easier you can use the polyfilled build.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

...or...

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.polyfilled.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## CSS

Include the `plyr.css` stylesheet into your `&lt;head&gt;`.

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;path/to/plyr.css&quot; /&gt;
```

If you want to use our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) for the default CSS, you can use the following:

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.css&quot; /&gt;
```

## SVG Sprite

The SVG sprite is loaded automatically from our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)). To change this, see the [options](#options) below. For
reference, the CDN hosted SVG sprite can be found at `https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.svg`.

### Self hosting

If you don&#039;t want to create a build system to include Plyr as an npm module, you can use the pre-built files. You have a few options:

- Download the files from the CDN links above, they&#039;re already minified.
- Download the files from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/plyr/dist/) or similar services.
- Build the project yourself using `npm i &amp;&amp; npm run build`, which installs the dependencies and spits out a build to `dist`.

# Ads

Plyr has partnered up with [vi.ai](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio) to offer monetization options for your videos. Getting setup is easy:

- [Sign up for a vi.ai account](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio)
- Grab your publisher ID from the code snippet
- Enable ads in the [config options](#options) and enter your publisher ID

Any questions regarding the ads can be sent straight to vi.ai and any issues with rendering raised through GitHub issues.

If you do not wish to use Vi, you can set your own `ads.tagUrl` [option](#options).

# Advanced

## Customizing the CSS

If you want to change any design tokens used for the rendering of the player, you can do so using [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

Here&#039;s a list of the properties and what they are used for:

| Name                                           | Description                                                                                             | Default / Fallback                                                    |

| `--plyr-focus-visible-color`                   | The color used for the focus styles when an element is `:focus-visible` (keyboard focused).             | `--plyr-color-main`                                                   |
| `--plyr-badge-background`                      | The background color for badges in the menu.                                                            | ![#4a5464](https://place-hold.it/15/4a5464/000000?text=+) `#4a5464`   |
| `--plyr-badge-text-color`                      | The text color for badges.                                                                              | ![#ffffff](https://place-hold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff`   |

to keep your things organized. They give you a visual overview of the current state of your project,
and make you productive by allowing you to focus on the few items that matter the most.

Since WeKan ® is a free software, you don’t have to trust us with your data and can
install Wekan on your own computer or server. In fact we encourage you to do
that by providing one-click installation on various platforms.

- WeKan ® is used in [most countries of the world](https://snapcraft.io/wekan).
- WeKan ® largest user has 30k users using WeKan ® in their company.
- WeKan ® has been [translated](https://app.transifex.com/wekan/) to about 105 languages.
- [Features][features]: WeKan ® has real-time user interface.
- [Platforms][platforms]: WeKan ® supports many platforms.
  WeKan ® is critical part of new platforms Wekan is currently being integrated to.

## Requirements

- 64bit: Linux [Snap](https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install) or [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io) /
  [Mac](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Mac) / [Windows](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-from-source-on-Windows).
  [More Platforms](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms), bundle for RasPi3 ARM and other CPUs where Node.js and MongoDB exists.
- 1 GB RAM minimum free for WeKan ®. Production server should have minimum total 4 GB RAM.
  For thousands of users, for example with [Docker](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/docker-compose.yml): 3 frontend servers,
  each having 2 CPU and 2 wekan-app containers. One backend wekan-db server with many CPUs.
- Enough disk space and alerts about low disk space. If you run out disk space, MongoDB database gets corrupted.
- SECURITY: Updating to newest WeKan ® version very often. Please check you do not have automatic updates of Sandstorm or Snap turned off.
  Old versions have security issues because of old versions Node.js etc. Only newest WeKan ® is supported.
  WeKan ® on Sandstorm is not usually affected by any Standalone WeKan ® (Snap/Docker/Source) security issues.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; ℹ️ **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected
&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

- **Lecture Attachments:** Any standalone code files or other attachments that are mentioned in course lectures (and attached to those lectures) are stored in the [/attachments](/attachments/) folder.
- **Other Resources:** Other resources (like the course slides) can be found in the [/other](/other/) folder.

The **Code Snapshots** and **Lecture Attachments** folders contain one subfolder per course section - this allows you to easily access the resources for a specific course section.

# How To Use Code Snapshots

Code snapshots are primarily provided to allow you to compare your code to mine. The snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and therefore reflect my code you see in the videos.

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine. You&#039;ll need to run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server - just as shown in the course.

## Deployment

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; You **cannot** deploy to static web hosts, including Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, and GitHub Pages.

### Password Protection

1. Go to the `config.js` file and set `challenge` to **true**. Then, set the environment variable as follows:
2. For PNPM: Run either `config=true pnpm start` or `$env:config=true; pnpm start`, depending on your server.
3. For Bun: Run either `config=true bun start` or `$env:config=true; bun start` if you prefer Bun.
4. For NPM: Run either `config=true npm start` or `$env:config=true; npm start` if you prefer NPM.


### Server Deployment

You must run these commands on your server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar
cd Interstellar
```

#### Ad-Free Deployment

```bash
git clone --branch Ad-Free https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar
cd Interstellar
```

Next depending on your package manager, run one of the following commands:

#### Bun

If you are using Bun, run the following commands:

```bash
bun i
bun start
```

#### pnpm

If you are using pnpm, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

#### npm

If you are using npm, run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

### Updating

```bash
cd Interstellar
git pull --force --allow-unrelated-histories # This may overwrite your local changes
```

&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Deploy to Heroku&quot; src=&quot;https://binbashbanana.github.io/deploy-buttons/buttons/remade/heroku.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://app.koyeb.com/deploy?type=git&amp;repository=github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Deploy to Koyeb&quot; src=&quot;https://binbashbanana.github.io/deploy-buttons/buttons/remade/koyeb.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Deployment Alternatives

For more deployment options, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/interstellar) for various ways to deploy Interstellar.
This includes methods of deploying to Render/OnRender.

#### What happened to Replit Deployment?

As of January 1st, 2024, Replit is [no longer free](https://blog.replit.com/hosting-changes). Try GitHub Codespaces instead.

### GitHub Codespaces

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re setting the port below 1023, then you must run `sudo PORT=1023`

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven&#039;t already.
2. Click &quot;Code&quot; (green button) and then &quot;Create Codespace on main.&quot;
3. In the terminal at the bottom, paste `pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm start`.
4. Respond to the application popup by clicking &quot;Make public.&quot;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Make sure you click the &quot;Make public.&quot; button, or the proxy won&#039;t function properly.&lt;br&gt;
&gt; If you get a Range Error, go back and make sure you clicked Make public!
5. Access the deployed website from the ports tab.
6. For subsequent uses in the same codespace, just run `pnpm start`

### Solution for if there is no popup.

1. Run `pnpm i`, and before `pnpm start`, prepend `PORT=8080`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `PORT=6969 pnpm start`.
2. If this does not work then you can prepend `$env:PORT=8080;`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `$env:PORT=6969; pnpm start`
3. Go to the ports tab, Click Forward A Port, And type the port number.
4. Right-click Visibility and set Port Visibility to Public.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We are committed to making Interstellar easy and personalized however, as of now we need your support in making it ad-free. Consider keeping ads so Interstellar can run freely or contribute by being a supporter.

## Report Issues

If you encounter problems, open an issue on GitHub, and we&#039;ll address it promptly.

&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Supporting MarkText&lt;/h2&gt;

MarkText is an MIT licensed open source project, and the latest version will always be downloadable for free from the GitHub release page. MarkText is still in development, and its development is inseparable from all sponsors. I hope you join them:

- [Become a backer or sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ranluo) or [One time donation](https://github.com/Jocs/sponsor.me)
- [Become a backer or sponsor on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/marktext)

##### What&#039;s the difference between Patreon and Open Collective?

Patreon: Funds will be directly sponsored to Luo Ran (@jocs) who created MarkText and continues to maintain it.
Open Collective: All expenses are transparent. The funds will be used for the development and maintenance of MarkText, funding online and offline activities, and acquiring other necessary resources.
Names and company logos of all sponsors (from both Patreon and Open Collective) will appear on the official website for MarkText and in its README.md file.

## Why make another editor?

1. I love writing. I have used a lot of markdown editors, yet there is still not an editor that can fully meet my needs. I don&#039;t like to be disturbed when I write by some unbearable bug. **MarkText** uses virtual DOM to render pages which has the added benefits of being highly efficient and being open source. That way anyone who loves markdown and writing can use MarkText.
2. As mentioned above, **MarkText** is completely free and open source and will be open source forever. We hope that all markdown lovers will contribute their own code and help develop **MarkText** into a popular markdown editor.
3. There are many markdown editors and all have their own merits, some have features which others don&#039;t. It&#039;s difficult to satisfy each markdown users&#039; needs but we hope **MarkText** will be able to satisfy each markdown user as much as possible. Although the latest **MarkText** is still not perfect, we will try to make it as best as we possibly can.
