            <h2>README</h2><pre># Multiple Window 3D Scene using Three.js

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a unique approach to creating and managing a 3D scene across multiple browser windows using Three.js and localStorage. It&#039;s designed for developers interested in advanced web graphics and window management techniques.

## Features
- 3D scene creation and rendering with Three.js.
- Synchronization of 3D scenes across multiple browser windows.
- Dynamic window management and state synchronization using localStorage.

## Installation
Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to start exploring the 3D scene.

```
git clone https://github.com/bgstaal/multipleWindow3dScene
```
## Usage
The main application logic is contained within `main.js` and `WindowManager.js`. The 3D scene is rendered in `index.html`, which serves as the entry point of the application.

## Structure and Components
- `index.html`: Entry point that sets up the HTML structure and includes the Three.js library and the main script.
- `WindowManager.js`: Core class managing window creation, synchronization, and state management across multiple windows.
- `main.js`: Contains the logic for initializing the 3D scene, handling window events, and rendering the scene.
- `three.r124.min.js`: Minified version of the Three.js library used for 3D graphics rendering.

## Detailed Functionality
- `WindowManager.js` handles the lifecycle of multiple browser windows, including creation, synchronization, and removal. It uses localStorage to maintain state across windows.
- `main.js` initializes the 3D scene using Three.js, manages the window&#039;s resize events, and updates the scene based on window interactions.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance or expand the project are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.

## License
This project is open-sourced under the MIT License.

[![Discord server](https://img.shields.io/discord/988743885121548329?color=%235865F2&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=%23fff)](https://discord.gg/yWRr2YnD9c)
[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/leaningtech/webvm)](https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/issues)

This repository hosts the source code for [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io), a Linux virtual machine that runs in your browser.

Try out the new Alpine / Xorg / i3 graphical environment: [https://webvm.io/alpine.html](https://webvm.io/alpine.html)

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/welcome_to_WebVM_alpine_2024.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

WebVM is a server-less virtual environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. It&#039;s designed to be Linux ABI-compatible. It runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.

WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser. CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator. 

# Enable networking

Modern browsers do not provide APIs to directly use TCP or UDP. WebVM provides networking support by integrating with Tailscale, a VPN network that supports WebSockets as a transport layer.

- Open the &quot;Networking&quot; panel from the side-bar
- Click &quot;Connect to Tailscale&quot; from the panel
- Log in to Tailscale (create an account if you don&#039;t have one)
- Click &quot;Connect&quot; when prompted by Tailscale
- If you are unfamiliar with Tailscale or would like additional information see [WebVM and Tailscale](/docs/Tailscale.md).

# Fork, deploy, customize

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fork_deploy_instructions.gif&quot; alt=&quot;deploy_instructions_gif&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

- Fork the repository.
- Enable Github pages in settings.
	- Click on `Settings`.
	- Go to the `Pages` section.
	- Select `Github Actions` as the source.
        - If you are using a custom domain, ensure `Enforce HTTPS` is enabled. 
- Run the workflow.
	- Click on `Actions`.
	- Accept the prompt. This is required only once to enable Actions for your fork.
	- Click on the workflow named `Deploy`.
	- Click `Run workflow` and then once more `Run workflow` in the menu.
- After a few seconds a new `Deploy` workflow will start, click on it to see details.
- After the workflow completes, which takes a few minutes, it will show the URL below the `deploy_to_github_pages` job.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/result.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; &gt;

You can now customize `dockerfiles/debian_mini` to suit your needs, or make a new Dockerfile from scratch. Use the `Path to Dockerfile` workflow parameter to select it.

# Run WebVM locally with a custom Debian mini disk image

1. Clone the WebVM Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm.git
cd webvm
```

2. Download the Debian mini Ext2 image

	Run the following command to download the Debian mini Ext2 image:

	```

	(*You can also build your own disk image by selecting the **&quot;Upload GitHub release&quot;** workflow option*)

3. Update the configuration file

	Edit `config_public_terminal.js` to reference your local disk image:

- Replace: 
	
	`&quot;wss://disks.webvm.io/debian_large_20230522_5044875331.ext2&quot;`
	
	With:
	
	`&quot;/disk-images/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2&quot;`

	(*Use an absolute or relative URL pointing to the disk image location.*)


- Replace `&quot;cloud&quot;` with the correct disk image type: `&quot;bytes&quot;`
	
4. Build WebVM

	Run the following commands to install dependencies and build WebVM:

	```sh
	npm install
	npm run build
	```

	The output will be placed in the `build` directory.

5. Configure Nginx

- Create a directory for the disk image:

	```sh
	mkdir disk-images
	mv debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2 disk-images/
	```

- Modify your `nginx.conf` file to serve the disk image. Add the following location block:

	```nginx
	location /disk-images/ {
        root .;
        autoindex on;
	}
	```

6. Start Nginx

	Run the following command to start Nginx:

	```sh
	nginx -p . -c nginx.conf
	```

	*Nginx will automatically serve the build directory.*

7. Access WebVM

	Open a browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.

	Enjoy your local WebVM!

# Example customization: Python3 REPL

The `Deploy` workflow takes into account the `CMD` specified in the Dockerfile. To build a REPL you can simply apply this patch and deploy.

```diff

### 📋 Setting up your environment

This curriculum has a development environment ready to go! As you get started you can choose to run the curriculum in a [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces/) (_a browser-based, no installs needed environment_), or locally on your computer using a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon).

#### Create your repository
For you to easily save your work, it is recommended that you create your own copy of this repository. You can do this by clicking the **Use this template** button at the top of the page. This will create a new repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the curriculum.

Follow these steps:
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the &quot;Fork&quot; button at the top-right corner of this page.
2. **Clone the Repository**:   `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners.git`

#### Running the curriculum in a Codespace

In your copy of this repository that you created, click the **Code** button and select **Open with Codespaces**. This will create a new Codespace for you to work in.

&lt;img src=&quot;./images/createcodespace.png&quot; alt=&quot;Create codespace&quot; style=&quot;width:270px;&quot;/&gt;

#### Running the curriculum locally on your computer

To run this curriculum locally on your computer, you will need a text editor, a browser and a command line tool. Our first lesson, [Introduction to Programming Languages and Tools of the Trade](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-getting-started-lessons/1-intro-to-programming-languages), will walk you through various options for each of these tools for you to select what works best for you.

Our recommendation is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) as your editor, which also has a built-in [Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon). You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon).


1. Clone your repository to your computer. You can do this by clicking the **Code** button and copying the URL:

    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/createcodespace.png&quot; alt=&quot;Copy your repository URL&quot; style=&quot;width:270px;&quot;/&gt;

    Then, open [Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) and run the following command, replacing `&lt;your-repository-url&gt;` with the URL you just copied:

    ```bash 
    git clone &lt;your-repository-url&gt;
    ```

2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by clicking **File** &gt; **Open Folder** and selecting the folder you just cloned.


&gt;  Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions:
&gt;
&gt; * [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&amp;WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) - to preview HTML pages within Visual Studio Code
&gt; * [Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot&amp;WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) - to help you write code faster

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Hiring Without Whiteboards

A list of companies (or teams) that don&#039;t do &quot;whiteboard&quot; interviews. &quot;Whiteboards&quot; is used as a metaphor, and is a _symbol_ for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad – CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category.

The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) [our recommendations](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for ways to conduct better interviews.

### tl;dr

- Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is 👍
- Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is 👎

Please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to be added.

### Duds

If you&#039;ve been through an interview with one of these companies recently, and your experience suggests otherwise from their description, please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to remove them from this list.

### I want to search/sort/filter/group by X!

Check out our [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shr3eGPDm3wGjT2gA)!

Additions to this document that are properly formatted will automatically be pushed and added to Airtable. Keywords from the description will also be extracted. You can see (and contribute!) to the [API here](https://github.com/poteto/hww-api).

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

Look at the [Local Development Guide](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/advanced-topics/development) for instructions on setting up a local development environment.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/foliate.svg)](https://repology.org/project/foliate/versions)

#### Optional dependencies

`iso-codes (&gt;= 3.67)` is needed for displaying language and region names.

For Mobipocket (.mobi) and Kindle File Format (.azw, .azw3) support, you would need Python (2.7 or &gt;= 3.4).

Auto-hyphenation is done using CSS hyphenation. To enable CSS hyphenation in WebKitGTK, you will need to install the hyphenation rules, e.g., `hyphen-en` for English, `hyphen-fr` for French, etc.

For offline dictionary support, install `dictd` or `sdcv`.

For text-to-speech support, install `espeak-ng`, or `festival`, and packages for the individual voices.

To enable spellchecking for notes, `gspell` (`gir1.2-gspell-1` for Debian based distributions) is required.

`libhandy` (`gir1.2-handy-0.0`) is recommended to make the interface work better on larger as well as smaller screens.

If `tracker3` (`gir1.2-tracker-3.0`) is installed, it can be used to track the locations of files.

### Building manually from source

The following dependencies are required for building:

- `meson (&gt;= 0.40)`
- `gettext`

The following are runtime requirements:

- `gjs (&gt;= 1.52)`
- `webkit2gtk` (`gir1.2-webkit2-4.0` for Debian based distributions)

To install, run the following commands:

```bash
meson build --prefix=/usr
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
```

To uninstall, run

```bash
sudo ninja -C build uninstall
```

#### Build and run from source without installing

The following commands will build Foliate and install it inside a directory:

```bash
meson build --prefix=$PWD/run
ninja -C build
ninja -C build install
```

To run the application, you&#039;ll need to set the schema directory for GSettings:

```bash
GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=$PWD/run/share/glib-2.0/schemas ./run/bin/com.github.johnfactotum.Foliate
```

#### Building a Debian/Ubuntu Package

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential debhelper meson gettext
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc
```

&gt; Version 5 – the iconic SVG, font, and CSS framework

The internet&#039;s most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from
scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.

### Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?

Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don&#039;t plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.

Documentation is still available but it&#039;s moved to
[https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0) and
[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

## Introduction
[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

## General
**👉🏼 Want to score an easy open-source contribution?** Check out our [Good first issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) label.

**🕰️ Looking for the older version of Swagger UI?** Refer to the [*2.x* branch](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x).


This repository publishes three different NPM modules:

* [swagger-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc.).
* [swagger-ui-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that can&#039;t resolve npm module dependencies.
* [swagger-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-react) is Swagger UI packaged as a React component for use in React applications.

We strongly suggest that you use `swagger-ui` instead of `swagger-ui-dist` if you&#039;re building a single-page application, since `swagger-ui-dist` is significantly larger.

If you are looking for plain ol&#039; HTML/JS/CSS, [download the latest release](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest) and copy the contents of the `/dist` folder to your server.


## Compatibility
The OpenAPI Specification has undergone 5 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  Compatibility between Swagger UI and the OpenAPI Specification is as follows:

| Swagger UI Version | Release Date | OpenAPI Spec compatibility                           | Notes                                                                 |

## Anonymized analytics

SwaggerUI uses [Scarf](https://scarf.sh/) to collect [anonymized installation analytics](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-what-information-does-scarf-js-send-about-me). These analytics help support the maintainers of this library and ONLY run during installation. To [opt out](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-how-can-i-opt-out-of-analytics), you can set the `scarfSettings.enabled` field to `false` in your project&#039;s `package.json`:

```
// package.json
{
  // ...
  &quot;scarfSettings&quot;: {
    &quot;enabled&quot;: false
  }
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `SCARF_ANALYTICS` to `false` as part of the environment that installs your npm packages, e.g., `SCARF_ANALYTICS=false npm install`.

## Installing

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install axios
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add axios
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
$ pnpm add axios
```

Using jsDelivr CDN:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Using unpkg CDN:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Example

### note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with `require()` use the following approach:

```js
const axios = require(&#039;axios&#039;).default;

// axios.&lt;method&gt; will now provide autocomplete and parameter typings
```

Performing a `GET` request

```js
const axios = require(&#039;axios&#039;).default;

// Make a request for a user with a given ID
axios.get(&#039;/user?ID=12345&#039;)
  .then(function (response) {
    // handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    // handle error
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios.get(&#039;/user&#039;, {
    params: {
      ID: 12345
    }
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });  

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(&#039;/user?ID=12345&#039;);
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

&gt; **NOTE:** `async/await` is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
&gt; Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.

Performing a `POST` request

```js
axios.post(&#039;/user&#039;, {
    firstName: &#039;Fred&#039;,
    lastName: &#039;Flintstone&#039;
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

Performing multiple concurrent requests

```js
function getUserAccount() {
  return axios.get(&#039;/user/12345&#039;);
}

function getUserPermissions() {
  return axios.get(&#039;/user/12345/permissions&#039;);
}

Promise.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()])
  .then(function (results) {
    const acct = results[0];
    const perm = results[1];
  });
```

## axios API

Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to `axios`.

##### axios(config)

```js
// Send a POST request
axios({
  method: &#039;post&#039;,
  url: &#039;/user/12345&#039;,
  data: {
    firstName: &#039;Fred&#039;,
    lastName: &#039;Flintstone&#039;
  }
});
```

```js
// GET request for remote image in node.js
axios({
  method: &#039;get&#039;,
  url: &#039;https://bit.ly/2mTM3nY&#039;,
  responseType: &#039;stream&#039;
})
  .then(function (response) {
    response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(&#039;ada_lovelace.jpg&#039;))
  });
```

##### axios(url[, config])

```js
// Send a GET request (default method)
axios(&#039;/user/12345&#039;);
```

### Request method aliases

For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.

##### axios.request(config)
##### axios.get(url[, config])
##### axios.delete(url[, config])
##### axios.head(url[, config])
##### axios.options(url[, config])
##### axios.post(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios.put(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios.patch(url[, data[, config]])

###### NOTE
When using the alias methods `url`, `method`, and `data` properties don&#039;t need to be specified in config.

### Concurrency (Deprecated)
Please use `Promise.all` to replace the below functions.

Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.

axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)

### Creating an instance

You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.

##### axios.create([config])

```js
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: &#039;https://some-domain.com/api/&#039;,
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: {&#039;X-Custom-Header&#039;: &#039;foobar&#039;}
});
```

### Instance methods

The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.

##### axios#request(config)
##### axios#get(url[, config])
##### axios#delete(url[, config])
##### axios#head(url[, config])
##### axios#options(url[, config])
##### axios#post(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#put(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#patch(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#getUri([config])

## Request Config

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the `url` is required. Requests will default to `GET` if `method` is not specified.

```js
{
  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: &#039;/user&#039;,

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: &#039;get&#039;, // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` unless `url` is absolute.
  // It can be convenient to set `baseURL` for an instance of axios to pass relative URLs
  // to methods of that instance.
  baseURL: &#039;https://some-domain.com/api/&#039;,

  // `transformRequest` allows changes to the request data before it is sent to the server
  // This is only applicable for request methods &#039;PUT&#039;, &#039;POST&#039;, &#039;PATCH&#039; and &#039;DELETE&#039;
  // The last function in the array must return a string or an instance of Buffer, ArrayBuffer,
  // FormData or Stream
  // You may modify the headers object.
  transformRequest: [function (data, headers) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `transformResponse` allows changes to the response data to be made before
  // it is passed to then/catch
  transformResponse: [function (data) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `headers` are custom headers to be sent
  headers: {&#039;X-Requested-With&#039;: &#039;XMLHttpRequest&#039;},

  // `params` are the URL parameters to be sent with the request
  // Must be a plain object or a URLSearchParams object
  params: {
    ID: 12345
  },

  // `paramsSerializer` is an optional config in charge of serializing `params`
  paramsSerializer: {
    indexes: null // array indexes format (null - no brackets, false - empty brackets, true - brackets with indexes)
  },

  // `data` is the data to be sent as the request body
  // Only applicable for request methods &#039;PUT&#039;, &#039;POST&#039;, &#039;DELETE , and &#039;PATCH&#039;
  // When no `transformRequest` is set, must be of one of the following types:
  // - string, plain object, ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, URLSearchParams
  // - Browser only: FormData, File, Blob
  // - Node only: Stream, Buffer
  data: {
    firstName: &#039;Fred&#039;
  },
  
  // syntax alternative to send data into the body
  // method post
  // only the value is sent, not the key
  data: &#039;Country=Brasil&amp;City=Belo Horizonte&#039;,

  // `timeout` specifies the number of milliseconds before the request times out.
  // If the request takes longer than `timeout`, the request will be aborted.
  timeout: 1000, // default is `0` (no timeout)

  // `withCredentials` indicates whether or not cross-site Access-Control requests
  // should be made using credentials
  withCredentials: false, // default

  // `adapter` allows custom handling of requests which makes testing easier.
  // Return a promise and supply a valid response (see lib/adapters/README.md).
  adapter: function (config) {
    /* ... */
  },

  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used, and supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  // Please note that only HTTP Basic auth is configurable through this parameter.
  // For Bearer tokens and such, use `Authorization` custom headers instead.
  auth: {
    username: &#039;janedoe&#039;,
    password: &#039;s00pers3cret&#039;
  },

  // `responseType` indicates the type of data that the server will respond with
  // options are: &#039;arraybuffer&#039;, &#039;document&#039;, &#039;json&#039;, &#039;text&#039;, &#039;stream&#039;
  //   browser only: &#039;blob&#039;
  responseType: &#039;json&#039;, // default

  // `responseEncoding` indicates encoding to use for decoding responses (Node.js only)
  // Note: Ignored for `responseType` of &#039;stream&#039; or client-side requests
  responseEncoding: &#039;utf8&#039;, // default

  // `xsrfCookieName` is the name of the cookie to use as a value for xsrf token
  xsrfCookieName: &#039;XSRF-TOKEN&#039;, // default

  // `xsrfHeaderName` is the name of the http header that carries the xsrf token value
  xsrfHeaderName: &#039;X-XSRF-TOKEN&#039;, // default

  // `onUploadProgress` allows handling of progress events for uploads
  // browser only
  onUploadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // Do whatever you want with the native progress event
  },

  // `onDownloadProgress` allows handling of progress events for downloads
  // browser only
  onDownloadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // Do whatever you want with the native progress event
  },

  // `maxContentLength` defines the max size of the http response content in bytes allowed in node.js
  maxContentLength: 2000,

  // `maxBodyLength` (Node only option) defines the max size of the http request content in bytes allowed
  maxBodyLength: 2000,

  // `validateStatus` defines whether to resolve or reject the promise for a given
  // HTTP response status code. If `validateStatus` returns `true` (or is set to `null`
  // or `undefined`), the promise will be resolved; otherwise, the promise will be
  // rejected.
  validateStatus: function (status) {
    return status &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; status &lt; 300; // default
  },

  // `maxRedirects` defines the maximum number of redirects to follow in node.js.
  // If set to 0, no redirects will be followed.
  maxRedirects: 21, // default

  // `beforeRedirect` defines a function that will be called before redirect.
  // Use this to adjust the request options upon redirecting,
  // to inspect the latest response headers,
  // or to cancel the request by throwing an error
  // If maxRedirects is set to 0, `beforeRedirect` is not used.
  beforeRedirect: (options, { headers }) =&gt; {
    if (options.hostname === &quot;example.com&quot;) {
      options.auth = &quot;user:password&quot;;
    }
  },

  // `socketPath` defines a UNIX Socket to be used in node.js.
  // e.g. &#039;/var/run/docker.sock&#039; to send requests to the docker daemon.
  // Only either `socketPath` or `proxy` can be specified.
  // If both are specified, `socketPath` is used.
  socketPath: null, // default

  // `httpAgent` and `httpsAgent` define a custom agent to be used when performing http
  // and https requests, respectively, in node.js. This allows options to be added like
  // `keepAlive` that are not enabled by default.
  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),
  httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),

  // `proxy` defines the hostname, port, and protocol of the proxy server.
  // You can also define your proxy using the conventional `http_proxy` and
  // `https_proxy` environment variables. If you are using environment variables
  // for your proxy configuration, you can also define a `no_proxy` environment
  // variable as a comma-separated list of domains that should not be proxied.
  // Use `false` to disable proxies, ignoring environment variables.
  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used to connect to the proxy, and
  // supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Proxy-Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Proxy-Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  // If the proxy server uses HTTPS, then you must set the protocol to `https`. 
  proxy: {
    protocol: &#039;https&#039;,
    host: &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;,
    port: 9000,
    auth: {

  cancelToken: new CancelToken(function (cancel) {
  }),

  // an alternative way to cancel Axios requests using AbortController
  signal: new AbortController().signal,

  // `decompress` indicates whether or not the response body should be decompressed

  // Using the insecure parser should be avoided.
  // see options https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/http.html#http_http_request_url_options_callback

## Response Schema

The response for a request contains the following information.

```js
{
  // `data` is the response that was provided by the server
  data: {},

  // `status` is the HTTP status code from the server response
  status: 200,

  // `statusText` is the HTTP status message from the server response
  statusText: &#039;OK&#039;,

  // `headers` the HTTP headers that the server responded with
  // All header names are lowercase and can be accessed using the bracket notation.
  // Example: `response.headers[&#039;content-type&#039;]`
  headers: {},

  // `config` is the config that was provided to `axios` for the request
  config: {},

  // `request` is the request that generated this response
  // It is the last ClientRequest instance in node.js (in redirects)
  // and an XMLHttpRequest instance in the browser
  request: {}

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

This project comes as a pre-built docker image that enables you to easily forward to your websites
running at home or otherwise, including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx or Letsencrypt.

- [Quick Setup](#quick-setup)
- [Full Setup](https://nginxproxymanager.com/setup/)
- [Screenshots](https://nginxproxymanager.com/screenshots/)

## Project Goal

I created this project to fill a personal need to provide users with an easy way to accomplish reverse
proxying hosts with SSL termination and it had to be so easy that a monkey could do it. This goal hasn&#039;t changed.
While there might be advanced options they are optional and the project should be as simple as possible
so that the barrier for entry here is low.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jc21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://public.jc21.com/github/by-me-a-coffee.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buy Me A Coffee&quot; style=&quot;height: 51px !important;width: 217px !important;&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;


## Features

- Beautiful and Secure Admin Interface based on [Tabler](https://tabler.github.io/)
- Easily create forwarding domains, redirections, streams and 404 hosts without knowing anything about Nginx
- Free SSL using Let&#039;s Encrypt or provide your own custom SSL certificates
- Access Lists and basic HTTP Authentication for your hosts
- Advanced Nginx configuration available for super users
- User management, permissions and audit log


## Hosting your home network

I won&#039;t go in to too much detail here but here are the basics for someone new to this self-hosted world.

1. Your home router will have a Port Forwarding section somewhere. Log in and find it
2. Add port forwarding for port 80 and 443 to the server hosting this project
3. Configure your domain name details to point to your home, either with a static ip or a service like DuckDNS or [Amazon Route53](https://github.com/jc21/route53-ddns)
4. Use the Nginx Proxy Manager as your gateway to forward to your other web based services

## Quick Setup

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose

- [Docker Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker-Compose Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file similar to this:

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: &#039;docker.io/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest&#039;
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - &#039;80:80&#039;
      - &#039;81:81&#039;
      - &#039;443:443&#039;
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

This is the bare minimum configuration required. See the [documentation](https://nginxproxymanager.com/setup/) for more.

3. Bring up your stack by running

```bash
docker-compose up -d

# If using docker-compose-plugin
docker compose up -d

```

4. Log in to the Admin UI

When your docker container is running, connect to it on port `81` for the admin interface.
Sometimes this can take a little bit because of the entropy of keys.

[http://127.0.0.1:81](http://127.0.0.1:81)

Default Admin User:
```
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme
```

Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify your details and change your password.
