Meetings are currently held on the [matrix.org platform](https://matrix.to/#/#jquery_meeting:gitter.im).

Meeting minutes can be found at [meetings.jquery.org](https://meetings.jquery.org/category/core/).

The latest version of jQuery is available at [https://jquery.com/download/](https://jquery.com/download/).

## Version support

| Version | Branch     | Status   |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 4.x     | main       | Beta     |
| 3.x     | 3.x-stable | Active   |
| 2.x     | 2.x-stable | Inactive |
| 1.x     | 1.x-stable | Inactive |

Once 4.0.0 final is released, the 3.x branch will continue to receive updates for a limited time. The 2.x and 1.x branches are no longer supported.

Commercial support for inactive versions is available from [HeroDevs](https://herodevs.com/support/jquery-nes).

Learn more about our [version support](https://jquery.com/support/).

## Contribution Guides

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)

### References to issues/PRs

GitHub issues/PRs are usually referenced via `gh-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue/PR. You can find such an issue/PR under `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/NUMBER`.

jQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under [bugs.jquery.com](https://bugs.jquery.com/). It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern `trac-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under `https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/NUMBER`.

## Environments in which to use jQuery

- [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/)
- jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.

## What you need to build your own jQuery

To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

For Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.

## How to build your own jQuery

First, [clone the jQuery git repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Then, enter the jquery directory, install dependencies, and run the build script:

```bash
cd jquery
npm install
npm run build
```

The built version of jQuery will be placed in the `dist/` directory, along with a minified copy and associated map file.

## Build all jQuery release files

To build all variants of jQuery, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build:all
```

This will create all of the variants that jQuery includes in a release, including `jquery.js`, `jquery.slim.js`, `jquery.module.js`, and `jquery.slim.module.js` along their associated minified files and sourcemaps.

`jquery.module.js` and `jquery.slim.module.js` are [ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that export `jQuery` and `$` as named exports are placed in the `dist-module/` directory rather than the `dist/` directory.

## Building a Custom jQuery

The build script can be used to create a custom version of jQuery that includes only the modules you need.

Any module may be excluded except for `core`. When excluding `selector`, it is not removed but replaced with a small wrapper around native `querySelectorAll` (see below for more information).

### Build Script Help

To see the full list of available options for the build script, run the following:

```bash
npm run build -- --help
```

### Modules

To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the `src` folder (without the `.js` extension) to the `--exclude` option. When using the `--include` option, the default includes are dropped and a build is created with only those modules.

Some example modules that can be excluded or included are:

- **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.
- **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.
- **ajax/script**: The `&lt;script&gt;` AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.
- **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.
- **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).
- **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.
- **deprecated**: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.
- **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.
- **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(&quot;slow&quot;)`.
- **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.
- **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.
- **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.
- **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.
- **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(&quot;ready&quot;, ...)` or similar will not be triggered.
- **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.
- **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.
- **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.

- **selector**: The full jQuery selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced with a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser&#039;s `querySelectorAll` method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the [selector-native.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/src/selector-native.js) file for details.

*Note*: Excluding the full `selector` module will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as `effects/animatedSelector` and `css/hiddenVisibleSelectors`).

##### AMD name

You can set the module name for jQuery&#039;s AMD definition. By default, it is set to &quot;jquery&quot;, which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you&#039;d like to change this. Pass it to the `--amd` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --amd=&quot;custom-name&quot;
```

Or, to define anonymously, leave the name blank.

```bash
npm run build -- --amd
```

##### File name and directory

The default name for the built jQuery file is `jquery.js`; it is placed under the `dist/` directory. It&#039;s possible to change the file name using `--filename` and the directory using `--dir`. `--dir` is relative to the project root.

```bash
npm run build -- --slim --filename=&quot;jquery.slim.js&quot; --dir=&quot;/tmp&quot;
```

This would create a slim version of jQuery and place it under `tmp/jquery.slim.js`.

##### ECMAScript Module (ESM) mode

By default, jQuery generates a regular script JavaScript file. You can also generate an ECMAScript module exporting `jQuery` as the default export using the `--esm` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.module.js --esm
```

##### Factory mode

By default, jQuery depends on a global `window`. For environments that don&#039;t have one, you can generate a factory build that exposes a function accepting `window` as a parameter that you can provide externally (see [`README` of the published package](build/fixtures/README.md) for usage instructions). You can generate such a factory using the `--factory` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.js --factory
```

This option can be mixed with others like `--esm` or `--slim`:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.slim.module.js --factory --esm --slim --dir=&quot;/dist-module&quot;
```

#### Custom Build Examples

Create a custom build using `npm run build`, listing the modules to be excluded. Excluding a top-level module also excludes its corresponding directory of modules.

Exclude all **ajax** functionality:

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=ajax
```

Excluding **css** removes modules depending on CSS: **effects**, **offset**, **dimensions**.

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=css
```

Exclude a bunch of modules (`-e` is an alias for `--exclude`):

```bash
npm run build -- -e ajax/jsonp -e css -e deprecated -e dimensions -e effects -e offset -e wrap
```

There is a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.js --slim
```

Or, to create the slim build as an esm module:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.module.js --slim --esm
```

*Non-official custom builds are not regularly tested. Use them at your own risk.*

## Running the Unit Tests

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start `npm start` to auto-build jQuery as you work:

```bash
npm start
```

Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the &quot;test&quot; directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:

- Windows: [WAMP download](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
- Mac: [MAMP download](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
- Linux: [Setting up LAMP](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/easy-lamp-server-installation/)
- [Mongoose (most platforms)](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)

## Essential Git

As the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it&#039;s useful to know some features used.

### Cleaning

If you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you&#039;ve worked on is gone after these):

```bash
git reset --hard upstream/main
git clean -fdx
```

### Rebasing

For feature/topic branches, you should always use the `--rebase` flag to `git pull`, or if you are usually handling many temporary &quot;to be in a github pull request&quot; branches, run the following to automate this:

```bash
git config branch.autosetuprebase local
```

(see `man git-config` for more information)

### Handling merge conflicts

If you&#039;re getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature
`git mergetool`. Even though the default tool `xxdiff` looks awful/old, it&#039;s rather useful.

The following are some commands that can be used there:

- `Ctrl + Alt + M` - automerge as much as possible
- `b` - jump to next merge conflict
- `s` - change the order of the conflicted lines
- `u` - undo a merge
- `left mouse button` - mark a block to be the winner
- `middle mouse button` - mark a line to be the winner
- `Ctrl + S` - save
- `Ctrl + Q` - quit

## [QUnit](https://api.qunitjs.com) Reference

### Test methods

```js
expect( numAssertions );
stop();
start();
```

*Note*: QUnit&#039;s eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.

### Test assertions

```js
ok( value, [message] );
equal( actual, expected, [message] );
notEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
deepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
strictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
throws( block, [expected], [message] );
```

## Test Suite Convenience Methods Reference

See [test/data/testinit.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/test/data/testinit.js).

### Returns an array of elements with the given IDs

```js
q( ... );
```

Example:

```js
q( &quot;main&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; );

=&gt; [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]
```

### Asserts that a selection matches the given IDs

```js
t( testName, selector, [ &quot;array&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;ids&quot; ] );
```

Example:

```js
t(&quot;Check for something&quot;, &quot;//[a]&quot;, [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]);
```

### Fires a native DOM event without going through jQuery

```js
fireNative( node, eventType );
```

Example:

```js
fireNative( jQuery( &quot;#elem&quot; )[ 0 ], &quot;click&quot; );
```

### Add random number to url to stop caching

```js
url( &quot;some/url&quot; );
```

Example:

```js
url( &quot;index.html&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/index.html?10538358428943&quot;


url( &quot;mock.php?foo=bar&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/mock.php?foo=bar&amp;10538358345554&quot;
```

### Run tests in an iframe

Some tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and
these can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions
remain in jQuery&#039;s main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup
and setup code should be placed in the iframe file.

```js
testIframe( testName, fileName,
  function testCallback(
      assert, jQuery, window, document,
	  [ additional args ] ) {
	...
  } );
```

This loads a page, constructing a url with fileName `&quot;./data/&quot; + fileName`.
The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by
including the &quot;/test/data/iframeTest.js&quot; script and calling
`startIframeTest( [ additional args ] )` when appropriate. Often this
will be after either document ready or `window.onload` fires.

The `testCallback` receives the QUnit `assert` object created by `testIframe`
for this test, followed by the global `jQuery`, `window`, and `document` from
the iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to `startIframeTest`,
they follow the `document` argument.

### ⚠️ While these extensions work for the most part, i&#039;m very busy at the moment and so unable to keep on top of everything here, thanks for your patience!

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts.git`  
to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory

   The script will then automatically install all custom scripts and nodes.  
   It will attempt to use symlinks and junctions to prevent having to copy files and keep them up to date.

- For uninstallation:
  - Delete the cloned repo in `custom_nodes`
  - Ensure `web/extensions/pysssss/CustomScripts` has also been removed

# Update
1. Navigate to the cloned repo e.g. `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts`
2. `git pull`

# Features

Node allows you to either create a list of N repeats of the input node, or create N outputs from the input node.  
You can optionally decide if you want to reuse the input node, or create a new instance each time (e.g. a Checkpoint Loader would want to be re-used, but a random number would want to be unique)
TODO: Type safety on the wildcard outputs to require match with input

## Show Text
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125205205/230174888-c004fd48-da78-4de9-81c2-93a866fcfcd1.png)

### Multiple Kubernetes Clusters and Multiple Clouds

&lt;img src =&quot;https://meshery.io/assets/images/screens/multi-cluster-management.gif&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Meshery provides a single pane of glass to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure, including various cloud providers. Meshery enables consistent configuration, operation, and observability across your entire Kubernetes landscape.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dry-run your deployments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Meshery leverages Kubernetes&#039; built-in dry-run capabilities to allow you to simulate deployments without actually applying the changes to your cluster. This enables you to:

- Validate configurations: Ensure your deployment specifications (e.g., YAML manifests, Helm charts, Meshery Designs) are syntactically correct and will be accepted by the Kubernetes API server.   
- Identify potential issues: Detect errors in your configurations, such as invalid resource definitions, missing fields, or API version mismatches, before they impact your live environment.
- Preview changes: Understand the objects that Kubernetes would create or modify during a real deployment.
- Integrate with CI/CD: Incorporate dry-run as a step in your continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to automate pre-deployment checks and prevent faulty deployments.

By providing this dry-run functionality, Meshery helps you increase the reliability and stability of your Kubernetes deployments by catching potential problems early in the development and deployment process.
&lt;!-- 
Assess your cloud native infrastructure configuration against deployment and operational best practices with Meshery&#039;s configuration validator. Manage your workloads with confidence. Check your Kubernetes configuration for anti-patterns and avoid common pitfalls. --&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

### Visually and collaboratively manage your infrastructure

Using a GitOps-centric approach, visually and collaboratively design and manage your infrastructure and microservices. Meshery intelligently infers the manner in which each resource [interrelates](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/relationships) with each other. Meshery supports a broad variety of built-in relationships between components, which you can use to create your own custom relationships.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;See changes to your infra before you merge&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-snapshot.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;

- **Multiple Load Generators:** Meshery supports various load generators, including Fortio, Wrk2, and Nighthawk, allowing users to choose the tool that best suits your needs.
- **Configurable Performance Profiles:** Meshery provides a highly configurable set of load profiles with tunable facets, enabling users to generate TCP, gRPC, and HTTP load. You can customize parameters such as duration, concurrent threads, concurrent generators, and load generator type. 
- **Statistical Analysis:** Meshery performs statistical analysis on the results of performance tests, presenting data in the form of histograms with latency buckets. Understand the distribution of response times and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Comparison of Test Results:** Meshery enables you to compare the difference in request performance (latency and throughput) between independent performance tests. Save your load test configurations as Performance Profiles, making it easy to rerun tests with the same settings and track performance variations over time.
- **Kubernetes Cluster and Workload Metrics:** - Meshery connects to one or more Prometheus servers to gather both cluster and application metrics. Meshery also integrates with Grafana, allowing you to import your existing dashboards and visualize performance data.

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to produce infrastructure agnostic tooling, Meshery uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Performance&lt;/a&gt; specification as a common format to capture and measure your infrastructure&#039;s performance against a universal cloud native performance index. Meshery participates in advancing cloud native infrastructure adoption through the standardization of APIs. Meshery enables you to measure the value provided by Docker, Kubernetes, or other cloud native infrastructure in the context of the overhead incurred.&lt;/p&gt;

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the Godot game engine.

## Introduction

Godot MCP enables AI assistants to launch the Godot editor, run projects, capture debug output, and control project execution - all through a standardized interface.

This direct feedback loop helps AI assistants like Claude understand what works and what doesn&#039;t in real Godot projects, leading to better code generation and debugging assistance.

## Features

- **Launch Godot Editor**: Open the Godot editor for a specific project
- **Run Godot Projects**: Execute Godot projects in debug mode
- **Capture Debug Output**: Retrieve console output and error messages
- **Control Execution**: Start and stop Godot projects programmatically
- **Get Godot Version**: Retrieve the installed Godot version
- **List Godot Projects**: Find Godot projects in a specified directory
- **Project Analysis**: Get detailed information about project structure
- **Scene Management**:
  - Create new scenes with specified root node types
  - Add nodes to existing scenes with customizable properties
  - Load sprites and textures into Sprite2D nodes
  - Export 3D scenes as MeshLibrary resources for GridMap
  - Save scenes with options for creating variants
- **UID Management** (for Godot 4.4+):
  - Get UID for specific files
  - Update UID references by resaving resources

## Requirements

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download) installed on your system
- Node.js and npm
- An AI assistant that supports MCP (Cline, Cursor, etc.)

## Installation and Configuration

### Step 1: Install and Build

First, clone the repository and build the MCP server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp.git
cd godot-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Configure with Your AI Assistant

#### Option A: Configure with Cline

Add to your Cline MCP settings file (`~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`):

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;godot&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/absolute/path/to/godot-mcp/build/index.js&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;DEBUG&quot;: &quot;true&quot;                  // Optional: Enable detailed logging
      },
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;autoApprove&quot;: [
        &quot;launch_editor&quot;,
        &quot;run_project&quot;,
        &quot;get_debug_output&quot;,
        &quot;stop_project&quot;,
        &quot;get_godot_version&quot;,
        &quot;list_projects&quot;,
        &quot;get_project_info&quot;,
        &quot;create_scene&quot;,
        &quot;add_node&quot;,
        &quot;load_sprite&quot;,
        &quot;export_mesh_library&quot;,
        &quot;save_scene&quot;,
        &quot;get_uid&quot;,
        &quot;update_project_uids&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Configure with Cursor

**Using the Cursor UI:**

1. Go to **Cursor Settings** &gt; **Features** &gt; **MCP**
2. Click on the **+ Add New MCP Server** button
3. Fill out the form:
   - Name: `godot` (or any name you prefer)
   - Type: `command`
   - Command: `node /absolute/path/to/godot-mcp/build/index.js`
4. Click &quot;Add&quot;
5. You may need to press the refresh button in the top right corner of the MCP server card to populate the tool list

**Using Project-Specific Configuration:**

Create a file at `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project directory with the following content:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;godot&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/absolute/path/to/godot-mcp/build/index.js&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;DEBUG&quot;: &quot;true&quot;                  // Enable detailed logging
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Optional Environment Variables

You can customize the server behavior with these environment variables:

- `GODOT_PATH`: Path to the Godot executable (overrides automatic detection)
- `DEBUG`: Set to &quot;true&quot; to enable detailed server-side debug logging

## Example Prompts

Once configured, your AI assistant will automatically run the MCP server when needed. You can use prompts like:

```text
&quot;Launch the Godot editor for my project at /path/to/project&quot;

&quot;Run my Godot project and show me any errors&quot;

&quot;Get information about my Godot project structure&quot;

&quot;Analyze my Godot project structure and suggest improvements&quot;

&quot;Help me debug this error in my Godot project: [paste error]&quot;

&quot;Write a GDScript for a character controller with double jump and wall sliding&quot;

&quot;Create a new scene with a Player node in my Godot project&quot;

&quot;Add a Sprite2D node to my player scene and load the character texture&quot;

&quot;Export my 3D models as a MeshLibrary for use with GridMap&quot;

&quot;Create a UI scene with buttons and labels for my game&#039;s main menu&quot;

&quot;Get the UID for a specific script file in my Godot 4.4 project&quot;

&quot;Update UID references in my Godot project after upgrading to 4.4&quot;
```

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The Godot MCP server uses a bundled GDScript approach for complex operations:

1. **Direct Commands**: Simple operations like launching the editor or getting project info use Godot&#039;s built-in CLI commands directly.
2. **Bundled Operations Script**: Complex operations like creating scenes or adding nodes use a single, comprehensive GDScript file (`godot_operations.gd`) that handles all operations.

This architecture provides several benefits:

- **No Temporary Files**: Eliminates the need for temporary script files, keeping your system clean
- **Simplified Codebase**: Centralizes all Godot operations in one (somewhat) organized file
- **Better Maintainability**: Makes it easier to add new operations or modify existing ones
- **Improved Error Handling**: Provides consistent error reporting across all operations
- **Reduced Overhead**: Minimizes file I/O operations for better performance

The bundled script accepts operation type and parameters as JSON, allowing for flexible and dynamic operation execution without generating temporary files for each operation.

## Troubleshooting

- **Godot Not Found**: Set the GODOT_PATH environment variable to your Godot executable
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure the server is running and restart your AI assistant
- **Invalid Project Path**: Ensure the path points to a directory containing a project.godot file
- **Build Issues**: Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`
- **For Cursor Specifically**:
-   Ensure the MCP server shows up and is enabled in Cursor settings (Settings &gt; MCP)
-   MCP tools can only be run using the Agent chat profile (Cursor Pro or Business subscription)
-   Use &quot;Yolo Mode&quot; to automatically run MCP tool requests
