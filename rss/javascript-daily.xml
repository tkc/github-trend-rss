ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

- ESLint uses [Espree](https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/espree) for JavaScript parsing.
- ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
- ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`^18.18.0`, `^20.9.0`, or `&gt;=21.1.0`) built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)

You can install and configure ESLint using this command:

```shell
npm init @eslint/config@latest
```

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:

```shell
npx eslint yourfile.js
```

### pnpm Installation

To use ESLint with pnpm, we recommend setting up a `.npmrc` file with at least the following settings:

```text
auto-install-peers=true
node-linker=hoisted
```

This ensures that pnpm installs dependencies in a way that is more compatible with npm and is less likely to produce errors.

## Configuration

You can configure rules in your `eslint.config.js` files as in this example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from &quot;eslint/config&quot;;

export default defineConfig([
	{
		files: [&quot;**/*.js&quot;, &quot;**/*.cjs&quot;, &quot;**/*.mjs&quot;],
		rules: {
			&quot;prefer-const&quot;: &quot;warn&quot;,
			&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
		},
	},
]);
```

The names `&quot;prefer-const&quot;` and `&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;` are the names of [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules) in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:

- `&quot;off&quot;` or `0` - turn the rule off
- `&quot;warn&quot;` or `1` - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn&#039;t affect exit code)
- `&quot;error&quot;` or `2` - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the [configuration docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)).

## Version Support

The ESLint team provides ongoing support for the current version and six months of limited support for the previous version. Limited support includes critical bug fixes, security issues, and compatibility issues only.

ESLint offers commercial support for both current and previous versions through our partners, [Tidelift][tidelift] and [HeroDevs][herodevs].

See [Version Support](https://eslint.org/version-support) for more details.

## Code of Conduct

ESLint adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://eslint.org/conduct).

## Filing Issues

Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you&#039;re reporting:

- [Bug Report](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/report-bugs)
- [Propose a New Rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-new-rule)
- [Proposing a Rule Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-rule-change)
- [Request a Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/request-change)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does ESLint support JSX?

Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)). Please note that supporting JSX syntax _is not_ the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn&#039;t recognize. We recommend using [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react) if you are using React and want React semantics.

### Does Prettier replace ESLint?

No, ESLint and Prettier have different jobs: ESLint is a linter (looking for problematic patterns) and Prettier is a code formatter. Using both tools is common, refer to [Prettier&#039;s documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install#eslint-and-other-linters) to learn how to configure them to work well with each other.

### What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?

ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5, and every year from 2015 up until the most recent stage 4 specification (the default). You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax and other settings (like global variables) through [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure).

### What about experimental features?

ESLint&#039;s parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.

In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use [@babel/eslint-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser) and [@babel/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-plugin) to use any option available in Babel.

Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the [TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/)), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our [contributing guidelines](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute). Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.

### Which Node.js versions does ESLint support?

ESLint updates the supported Node.js versions with each major release of ESLint. At that time, ESLint&#039;s supported Node.js versions are updated to be:

1. The most recent maintenance release of Node.js
1. The lowest minor version of the Node.js LTS release that includes the features the ESLint team wants to use.
1. The Node.js Current release

ESLint is also expected to work with Node.js versions released after the Node.js Current release.

Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#prerequisites) for the officially supported Node.js versions for a given ESLint release.

### Where to ask for help?

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions) or stop by our [Discord server](https://eslint.org/chat).

### Why doesn&#039;t ESLint lock dependency versions?

Lock files like `package-lock.json` are helpful for deployed applications. They ensure that dependencies are consistent between environments and across deployments.

Packages like `eslint` that get published to the npm registry do not include lock files. `npm install eslint` as a user will respect version constraints in ESLint&#039;s `package.json`. ESLint and its dependencies will be included in the user&#039;s lock file if one exists, but ESLint&#039;s own lock file would not be used.

We intentionally don&#039;t lock dependency versions so that we have the latest compatible dependency versions in development and CI that our users get when installing ESLint in a project.

The Twilio blog has a [deeper dive](https://www.twilio.com/blog/lockfiles-nodejs) to learn more.

## Releases

We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a [release issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arelease) for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.

## Security Policy

ESLint takes security seriously. We work hard to ensure that ESLint is safe for everyone and that security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly. Read the full [security policy](https://github.com/eslint/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Semantic Versioning Policy

ESLint follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it&#039;s not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we&#039;ve defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint:

- Patch release (intended to not break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer linting errors.
    - A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).
    - Improvements to documentation.
    - Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.
    - Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn&#039;t work for anyone).
- Minor release (might break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors.
    - A new rule is created.
    - A new option to an existing rule that does not result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - A new addition to an existing rule to support a newly-added language feature (within the last 12 months) that will result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing rule is deprecated.
    - A new CLI capability is created.
    - New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).
    - A new formatter is created.
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and will result in strictly fewer linting errors (e.g., rule removals).
- Major release (likely to break your lint build)
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and may result in new linting errors (e.g., rule additions, most rule option updates).
    - A new option to an existing rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing formatter is removed.
    - Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. The public API includes:
        - Rule schemas
        - Configuration schema
        - Command-line options
        - Node.js API
        - Rule, formatter, parser, plugin APIs

According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` e.g. `&quot;eslint&quot;: &quot;~3.1.0&quot;` to guarantee the results of your builds.

至于为什么仓库名要叫CookLikeHOC，因为直接写Laoxiangji大概不方便阅读，而Home Original Chicken是china daily报道中所使用的老乡鸡的英文名，故简写成HOC。

An efficient server implies a lower cost of the infrastructure, better
responsiveness under load, and happy users. How can you efficiently handle the
resources of your server, knowing that you are serving the highest number of
requests possible, without sacrificing security validations and handy
development?

Enter Fastify. Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best
developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.
It is inspired by Hapi and Express and as far as we know, it is one of the
fastest web frameworks in town.

The `main` branch refers to the Fastify `v5` release.
Check out the [`4.x` branch](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/tree/4.x) for `v4`.

### Quick start

Create a folder and make it your current working directory:

```sh
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
```

Generate a fastify project with `npm init`:

```sh
npm init fastify
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

To start the app in dev mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

For production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Under the hood `npm init` downloads and runs [Fastify
Create](https://github.com/fastify/create-fastify), which in turn uses the
generate functionality of [Fastify CLI](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cli).


### Install

To install Fastify in an existing project as a dependency:

```sh
npm i fastify
```

### Example

```js
// Require the framework and instantiate it

// ESM
import Fastify from &#039;fastify&#039;

const fastify = Fastify({
  logger: true
})
// CommonJs
const fastify = require(&#039;fastify&#039;)({
  logger: true
})

// Declare a route
fastify.get(&#039;/&#039;, (request, reply) =&gt; {
  reply.send({ hello: &#039;world&#039; })
})

// Run the server!
fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err
  // Server is now listening on ${address}
})
```

With async-await:

```js
// ESM
import Fastify from &#039;fastify&#039;

const fastify = Fastify({
  logger: true
})
// CommonJs
const fastify = require(&#039;fastify&#039;)({
  logger: true
})

fastify.get(&#039;/&#039;, async (request, reply) =&gt; {
  reply.type(&#039;application/json&#039;).code(200)
  return { hello: &#039;world&#039; }
})

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err
  // Server is now listening on ${address}
})
```

Do you want to know more? Head to the &lt;a
href=&quot;./docs/Guides/Getting-Started.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
If you learn best by reading code, explore the official [demo](https://github.com/fastify/demo).

&gt; ## Note
&gt; `.listen` binds to the local host, `localhost`, interface by default
&gt; (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`, depending on the operating system configuration). If
&gt; you are running Fastify in a container (Docker,
&gt; [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), etc.), you may need to bind to `0.0.0.0`. Be
&gt; careful when listening on all interfaces; it comes with inherent
&gt; [security
&gt; risks](https://web.archive.org/web/20170711105010/https://snyk.io/blog/mongodb-hack-and-secure-defaults/).
&gt; See [the documentation](./docs/Reference/Server.md#listen) for more
&gt; information.

### Core features

- **Highly performant:** as far as we know, Fastify is one of the fastest web
  frameworks in town, depending on the code complexity we can serve up to 76+
  thousand requests per second.
- **Extensible:** Fastify is fully extensible via its hooks, plugins, and
  decorators.
- **Schema-based:** even if it is not mandatory we recommend using [JSON
  Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to validate your routes and serialize your
  outputs. Internally Fastify compiles the schema in a highly performant
  function.
- **Logging:** logs are extremely important but are costly; we chose the best
  logger to almost remove this cost, [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)!
- **Developer friendly:** the framework is built to be very expressive and help
  developers in their daily use without sacrificing performance and
  security.

### Benchmarks

__Machine:__ EX41S-SSD, Intel Core i7, 4Ghz, 64GB RAM, 4C/8T, SSD.

__Method:__: `autocannon -c 100 -d 40 -p 10 localhost:3000` * 2, taking the

These benchmarks taken using https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks. This is a
synthetic &quot;hello world&quot; benchmark that aims to evaluate the framework overhead.
The overhead that each framework has on your application depends on your
application. You should __always__ benchmark if performance matters to you.

# Introduction

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) designed to teach web
application security lessons.

This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The
exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and
penetration testing techniques.

**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
this program.*  WebGoat&#039;s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
the exposure.

**WARNING 2:** *This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
first thing that all hackers claim.*

# Installation instructions:

For more details check [the Contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 1. Run using Docker

Already have a browser and ZAP and/or Burp installed on your machine in this case you can run the WebGoat image directly using Docker.

Every release is also published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/webgoat/webgoat).

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 webgoat/webgoat
```

For some lessons you need the container run in the same timezone. For this you can set the TZ environment variable.
E.g.

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

If you want to use OWASP ZAP or another proxy, you can no longer use 127.0.0.1 or localhost. but
you can use custom host entries. For example:

```shell
127.0.0.1 www.webgoat.local www.webwolf.local
```

Then you can run the container with:

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e WEBGOAT_HOST=www.webgoat.local -e WEBWOLF_HOST=www.webwolf.local -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

Then visit http://www.webgoat.local:8080/WebGoat/ and http://www.webwolf.local:9090/WebWolf/

## 2. Run using Docker with complete Linux Desktop

Instead of installing tools locally we have a complete Docker image based on running a desktop in your browser. This way you only have to run a Docker image which will give you the best user experience.

```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 webgoat/webgoat-desktop
```

## 3. Standalone

Download the latest WebGoat release from [https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases)

```shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar
```

Click the link in the log to start WebGoat.

### 3.1 Running on a different port

If for some reason you want to run WebGoat on a different port, you can do so by adding the following parameter:

```shell
java -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar --webgoat.port=8001 --webwolf.port=8002
```

For a full overview of all the parameters you can use, please check the [WebGoat properties file](webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application-{webgoat, webwolf}.properties).

## 4. Run from the sources

### Prerequisites:

* Java 23
* Your favorite IDE
* Git, or Git support in your IDE

Open a command shell/window:

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:WebGoat/WebGoat.git
```

Now let&#039;s start by compiling the project.

```Shell
cd WebGoat
git checkout &lt;&lt;branch_name&gt;&gt;
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw clean install

# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd clean install

# Using docker or podman, you can than build the container locally
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t webgoat/webgoat
```

Now we are ready to run the project. WebGoat is using Spring Boot.

```Shell
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

```

... you should be running WebGoat on http://localhost:8080/WebGoat momentarily.

Note: The above link will redirect you to login page if you are not logged in. LogIn/Create account to proceed.

To change the IP address add the following variable to the `WebGoat/webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

```
server.address=x.x.x.x
```

## 4. Run with custom menu

For specialist only. There is a way to set up WebGoat with a personalized menu. You can leave out some menu categories or individual lessons by setting certain environment variables.

For instance running as a jar on a Linux/macOS it will look like this:

```Shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
export EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot;
export EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot;
java -jar target/webgoat-2023.8-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Or in a docker run it would (once this version is pushed into docker hub) look like this:

```Shell
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot; -e EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot; webgoat/webgoat
```

Crafting minds for Minecraft with LLMs and [Mineflayer!](https://prismarinejs.github.io/mineflayer/#/)

[FAQ](https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft/blob/main/FAQ.md) | [Discord Support](https://discord.gg/mp73p35dzC) | [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRotoL8P8D8) | [Blog Post](https://kolbynottingham.com/mindcraft/) | [Contributor TODO](https://github.com/users/kolbytn/projects/1) | [Paper Website](https://mindcraft-minecollab.github.io/index.html) | [MineCollab](https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft/blob/main/minecollab.md) 


&gt; [!Caution]
Do not connect this bot to public servers with coding enabled. This project allows an LLM to write/execute code on your computer. The code is sandboxed, but still vulnerable to injection attacks. Code writing is disabled by default, you can enable it by setting `allow_insecure_coding` to `true` in `settings.js`. Ye be warned.

## Requirements

- [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc) (up to v1.21.6, recommend v1.21.1)
- [Node.js Installed](https://nodejs.org/) (at least v18)
- One of these: [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) | [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) | [Anthropic API Key](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/getting-access-to-claude) | [Replicate API Key](https://replicate.com/) | [Hugging Face API Key](https://huggingface.co/) | [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com/keys) | [Ollama Installed](https://ollama.com/download). | [Mistral API Key](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/) | [Qwen API Key [Intl.]](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/developer-reference/get-api-key)/[[cn]](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/first-api-call-to-qwen?) | [Novita AI API Key](https://novita.ai/settings?utm_source=github_mindcraft&amp;utm_medium=github_readme&amp;utm_campaign=link#key-management) | [Cerebras API Key](https://cloud.cerebras.ai) | [Mercury API](https://platform.inceptionlabs.ai/docs)

## Install and Run

1. Make sure you have the requirements above.

2. Clone or download this repository (big green button) &#039;git clone https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft.git&#039;

3. Rename `keys.example.json` to `keys.json` and fill in your API keys (you only need one). The desired model is set in `andy.json` or other profiles. For other models refer to the table below.

4. In terminal/command prompt, run `npm install` from the installed directory

5. Start a minecraft world and open it to LAN on localhost port `55916`

6. Run `node main.js` from the installed directory

If you encounter issues, check the [FAQ](https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft/blob/main/FAQ.md) or find support on [discord](https://discord.gg/mp73p35dzC). We are currently not very responsive to github issues. To run tasks please refer to [Minecollab Instructions](minecollab.md#installation)

## Tasks

Bot performance can be roughly evaluated with Tasks. Tasks automatically intialize bots with a goal to aquire specific items or construct predefined buildings, and remove the bot once the goal is achieved.

To run tasks, you need python, pip, and optionally conda. You can then install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Tasks are defined in json files in the `tasks` folder, and can be run with: `python tasks/run_task_file.py --task_path=tasks/example_tasks.json`

For full evaluations, you will need to [download and install the task suite. Full instructions.](minecollab.md#installation)

## Model Customization

You can configure project details in `settings.js`. [See file.](settings.js)

You can configure the agent&#039;s name, model, and prompts in their profile like `andy.json` with the `model` field. For comprehensive details, see [Model Specifications](#model-specifications).

If you use Ollama, to install the models used by default (generation and embedding), execute the following terminal command:
`ollama pull sweaterdog/andy-4:micro-q8_0 &amp;&amp; ollama pull embeddinggemma`

To use Azure, you can reuse the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get the key from the Azure portal. See [azure.json](profiles/azure.json) for an example.

### Online Servers
To connect to online servers your bot will need an official Microsoft/Minecraft account. You can use your own personal one, but will need another account if you want to connect too and play with it. To connect, change these lines in `settings.js`:
```javascript
&quot;host&quot;: &quot;111.222.333.444&quot;,
&quot;port&quot;: 55920,
&quot;auth&quot;: &quot;microsoft&quot;,

// rest is same...
```
&gt; [!Important]
&gt; The bot&#039;s name in the profile.json must exactly match the Minecraft profile name! Otherwise the bot will spam talk to itself.

To use different accounts, Mindcraft will connect with the account that the Minecraft launcher is currently using. You can switch accounts in the launcer, then run `node main.js`, then switch to your main account after the bot has connected.

### Docker Container

If you intend to `allow_insecure_coding`, it is a good idea to run the app in a docker container to reduce risks of running unknown code. This is strongly recommended before connecting to remote servers.

```bash
docker run -i -t --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app -p 3000-3003:3000-3003 node:latest node main.js
```
or simply
```bash
docker-compose up
```

When running in docker, if you want the bot to join your local minecraft server, you have to use a special host address `host.docker.internal` to call your localhost from inside your docker container. Put this into your [settings.js](settings.js):

```javascript
&quot;host&quot;: &quot;host.docker.internal&quot;, // instead of &quot;localhost&quot;, to join your local minecraft from inside the docker container
```

To connect to an unsupported minecraft version, you can try to use [viaproxy](services/viaproxy/README.md)

# Bot Profiles

Bot profiles are json files (such as `andy.json`) that define:

1. Bot backend LLMs to use for talking, coding, and embedding.
2. Prompts used to influence the bot&#039;s behavior.
3. Examples help the bot perform tasks.

## Model Specifications

LLM models can be specified simply as `&quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;`. However, you can use different models for chat, coding, and embeddings. 
You can pass a string or an object for these fields. A model object must specify an `api`, and optionally a `model`, `url`, and additional `params`.

```json
&quot;model&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;,
  &quot;params&quot;: {
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 1000,
    &quot;temperature&quot;: 1
  }
},
&quot;code_model&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;
},
&quot;vision_model&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;
},
&quot;embedding&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;text-embedding-ada-002&quot;
},
&quot;speak_model&quot;: {
  &quot;api&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/&quot;,
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;tts-1&quot;,
  &quot;voice&quot;: &quot;echo&quot;
}

```

`model` is used for chat, `code_model` is used for newAction coding, `vision_model` is used for image interpretation, and `embedding` is used to embed text for example selection. If `code_model` or `vision_model` is not specified, `model` will be used by default. Not all APIs support embeddings or vision.

All apis have default models and urls, so those fields are optional. The `params` field is optional and can be used to specify additional parameters for the model. It accepts any key-value pairs supported by the api. Is not supported for embedding models.

## Embedding Models

Embedding models are used to embed and efficiently select relevant examples for conversation and coding.

Supported Embedding APIs: `openai`, `google`, `replicate`, `huggingface`, `novita`

If you try to use an unsupported model, then it will default to a simple word-overlap method. Expect reduced performance, recommend mixing APIs to ensure embedding support.

## Specifying Profiles via Command Line

By default, the program will use the profiles specified in `settings.js`. You can specify one or more agent profiles using the `--profiles` argument: `node main.js --profiles ./profiles/andy.json ./profiles/jill.json`

## Patches

Some of the node modules that we depend on have bugs in them. To add a patch, change your local node module file and run `npx patch-package [package-name]`

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Hiring Without Whiteboards

A list of companies (or teams) that don&#039;t do &quot;whiteboard&quot; interviews. &quot;Whiteboards&quot; is used as a metaphor, and is a _symbol_ for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad – CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category.

The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) [our recommendations](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for ways to conduct better interviews.

### tl;dr

- Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is 👍
- Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is 👎

Please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to be added.

### Duds

If you&#039;ve been through an interview with one of these companies recently, and your experience suggests otherwise from their description, please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to remove them from this list.

### I want to search/sort/filter/group by X!

[![Discord server](https://img.shields.io/discord/988743885121548329?color=%235865F2&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=%23fff)](https://discord.gg/yWRr2YnD9c)
[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/leaningtech/webvm)](https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/issues)

This repository hosts the source code for [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io), a Linux virtual machine that runs in your browser.

Try out the new Alpine / Xorg / i3 graphical environment: [https://webvm.io/alpine.html](https://webvm.io/alpine.html)

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/welcome_to_WebVM_alpine_2024.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

WebVM is a server-less virtual environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. It&#039;s designed to be Linux ABI-compatible. It runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.

WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser. CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator. 

# Enable networking

Modern browsers do not provide APIs to directly use TCP or UDP. WebVM provides networking support by integrating with Tailscale, a VPN network that supports WebSockets as a transport layer.

- Open the &quot;Networking&quot; panel from the side-bar
- Click &quot;Connect to Tailscale&quot; from the panel
- Log in to Tailscale (create an account if you don&#039;t have one)
- Click &quot;Connect&quot; when prompted by Tailscale
- If you are unfamiliar with Tailscale or would like additional information see [WebVM and Tailscale](/docs/Tailscale.md).

# Fork, deploy, customize

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fork_deploy_instructions.gif&quot; alt=&quot;deploy_instructions_gif&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

- Fork the repository.
- Enable Github pages in settings.
	- Click on `Settings`.
	- Go to the `Pages` section.
	- Select `Github Actions` as the source.
        - If you are using a custom domain, ensure `Enforce HTTPS` is enabled. 
- Run the workflow.
	- Click on `Actions`.
	- Accept the prompt. This is required only once to enable Actions for your fork.
	- Click on the workflow named `Deploy`.
	- Click `Run workflow` and then once more `Run workflow` in the menu.
- After a few seconds a new `Deploy` workflow will start, click on it to see details.
- After the workflow completes, which takes a few minutes, it will show the URL below the `deploy_to_github_pages` job.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/result.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; &gt;

You can now customize `dockerfiles/debian_mini` to suit your needs, or make a new Dockerfile from scratch. Use the `Path to Dockerfile` workflow parameter to select it.

# Run WebVM locally with a custom Debian mini disk image

1. Clone the WebVM Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm.git
cd webvm
```

2. Download the Debian mini Ext2 image

	Run the following command to download the Debian mini Ext2 image:

	```sh
	wget &quot;https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/releases/download/ext2_image/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2&quot;
	```

	(*You can also build your own disk image by selecting the **&quot;Upload GitHub release&quot;** workflow option*)

3. Update the configuration file

	Edit `config_public_terminal.js` to reference your local disk image:

- Replace: 
	
	`&quot;wss://disks.webvm.io/debian_large_20230522_5044875331.ext2&quot;`
	
	With:
	
	`&quot;/disk-images/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2&quot;`

	(*Use an absolute or relative URL pointing to the disk image location.*)


- Replace `&quot;cloud&quot;` with the correct disk image type: `&quot;bytes&quot;`
	
4. Build WebVM

	Run the following commands to install dependencies and build WebVM:

	```sh
	npm install
	npm run build
	```

	The output will be placed in the `build` directory.

5. Configure Nginx

- Create a directory for the disk image:

	```sh
	mkdir disk-images
	mv debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2 disk-images/
	```

- Modify your `nginx.conf` file to serve the disk image. Add the following location block:

	```nginx
	location /disk-images/ {
        root .;
        autoindex on;
	}
	```

6. Start Nginx

	Run the following command to start Nginx:

	```sh
	nginx -p . -c nginx.conf
	```

	*Nginx will automatically serve the build directory.*

7. Access WebVM

	Open a browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.

	Enjoy your local WebVM!

# Example customization: Python3 REPL

The `Deploy` workflow takes into account the `CMD` specified in the Dockerfile. To build a REPL you can simply apply this patch and deploy.

```diff
diff --git a/dockerfiles/debian_mini b/dockerfiles/debian_mini
index 2878332..1f3103a 100644

# How to use Claude AI

To access Claude AI, you need an API key. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Create an account
- Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/login) and sign up with your e-mail. You&#039;ll receive a sign in link to the Anthropic Console. 

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/anthropic_signup.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

2. Get your API key
- Once logged in, navigate to **Get API keys**.
- Purchase the amount of credits you need. After completing the purchase, you&#039;ll be able to generate the key through the API console.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/anthropic_api_payment.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

3. Log in with your API key
- Navigate to your WebVM and hover over the robot icon. This will show the Claude AI Integration tab. For added convenience, you can click the pin button in the top right corner to keep the tab in place.
- You&#039;ll see a prompt where you can insert your Claude API key.
- Insert your key and press enter.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/insert_key.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

4. Start using Claude AI
- Once your API key is entered, you can begin interacting with Claude AI by asking questions such as:

 __&quot;Solve the CTF challenge at `/home/user/chall1.bin.` Note that the binary reads from stdin.&quot;__

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/webvm_claude_ctf.gif&quot; alt=&quot;deploy_instructions_gif&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

**Important:** Your API key is private and should never be shared. We do not have access to your key, which is not only stored locally in your browser.

# Contributions

Contributions are very welcome! It helps me know what features are desired or what bugs are causing the most pain.

I have just one request; If you submit a pull request for a bugfix, please add a unit-test or integration-test (in the spec folder) that catches the problem.
 Even a PR that just has a failing test is fine - I can analyse what the test is doing and fix the code from that.

Note: Please try to avoid modifying the package version in a PR.
Versions are updated on release and any change will most likely result in merge collisions.

To be clear, all contributions added to this library will be included in the library&#039;s MIT licence.

# Importing[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

```javascript
const ExcelJS = require(&#039;exceljs&#039;);
```

## ES5 Imports[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

To use the ES5 transpiled code, for example for node.js versions older than 10, use the dist/es5 path.

```javascript
const ExcelJS = require(&#039;exceljs/dist/es5&#039;);
```

**Note:** The ES5 build has an implicit dependency on a number of polyfills which are no longer
 explicitly added by exceljs.
 You will need to add &quot;core-js&quot; and &quot;regenerator-runtime&quot; to your dependencies and
 include the following requires in your code before the exceljs import:

```javascript
// polyfills required by exceljs
require(&#039;core-js/modules/es.promise&#039;);
require(&#039;core-js/modules/es.string.includes&#039;);
require(&#039;core-js/modules/es.object.assign&#039;);
require(&#039;core-js/modules/es.object.keys&#039;);
require(&#039;core-js/modules/es.symbol&#039;);
require(&#039;core-js/modules/es.symbol.async-iterator&#039;);
require(&#039;regenerator-runtime/runtime&#039;);

const ExcelJS = require(&#039;exceljs/dist/es5&#039;);
```

For IE 11, you&#039;ll also need a polyfill to support unicode regex patterns. For example,

```js
const rewritePattern = require(&#039;regexpu-core&#039;);
const {generateRegexpuOptions} = require(&#039;@babel/helper-create-regexp-features-plugin/lib/util&#039;);

const {RegExp} = global;
try {
  new RegExp(&#039;a&#039;, &#039;u&#039;);
} catch (err) {
  global.RegExp = function(pattern, flags) {
    if (flags &amp;&amp; flags.includes(&#039;u&#039;)) {
      return new RegExp(rewritePattern(pattern, flags, generateRegexpuOptions({flags, pattern})));
    }
    return new RegExp(pattern, flags);
  };
  global.RegExp.prototype = RegExp.prototype;
}
```

## Browserify[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

ExcelJS publishes two browserified bundles inside the dist/ folder:

One with implicit dependencies on core-js polyfills...
```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-polyfill/6.26.0/polyfill.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;exceljs.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

And one without...
```html
&lt;script src=&quot;--your-project&#039;s-pollyfills-here--&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;exceljs.bare.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

workbook.calcProperties.fullCalcOnLoad = true;
```

## Workbook Views[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

The Workbook views controls how many separate windows Excel will open when viewing the workbook.

```javascript
workbook.views = [
  {
    x: 0, y: 0, width: 10000, height: 20000,
    firstSheet: 0, activeTab: 1, visibility: &#039;visible&#039;
  }
]
```

## Add a Worksheet[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

```javascript
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet(&#039;My Sheet&#039;);
```

Use the second parameter of the addWorksheet function to specify options for the worksheet.

For Example:

```javascript
// create a sheet with red tab colour
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet(&#039;My Sheet&#039;, {properties:{tabColor:{argb:&#039;FFC0000&#039;}}});

// create a sheet where the grid lines are hidden
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet(&#039;My Sheet&#039;, {views: [{showGridLines: false}]});

// create a sheet with the first row and column frozen
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet(&#039;My Sheet&#039;, {views:[{state: &#039;frozen&#039;, xSplit: 1, ySplit:1}]});

// Create worksheets with headers and footers
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet(&#039;My Sheet&#039;, {
  headerFooter:{firstHeader: &quot;Hello Exceljs&quot;, firstFooter: &quot;Hello World&quot;}
});

// create new sheet with pageSetup settings for A4 - landscape
const worksheet =  workbook.addWorksheet(&#039;My Sheet&#039;, {
  pageSetup:{paperSize: 9, orientation:&#039;landscape&#039;}
});
```

## Remove a Worksheet[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

Use the worksheet `id` to remove the sheet from workbook.

For Example:

```javascript
// Create a worksheet
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet(&#039;My Sheet&#039;);

// Remove the worksheet using worksheet id
workbook.removeWorksheet(sheet.id)
```

## Access Worksheets[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;
```javascript
// Iterate over all sheets
// Note: workbook.worksheets.forEach will still work but this is better
workbook.eachSheet(function(worksheet, sheetId) {
  // ...
});

// fetch sheet by name
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet(&#039;My Sheet&#039;);

// fetch sheet by id
// INFO: Be careful when using it!
// It tries to access to `worksheet.id` field. Sometimes (really very often) workbook has worksheets with id not starting from 1.
// For instance It happens when any worksheet has been deleted.
// It&#039;s much more safety when you assume that ids are random. And stop to use this function.
// If you need to access all worksheets in a loop please look to the next example.
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet(1);

// access by `worksheets` array:
workbook.worksheets[0]; //the first one;

```

It&#039;s important to know that `workbook.getWorksheet(1) != Workbook.worksheets[0]` and `workbook.getWorksheet(1) != Workbook.worksheets[1]`,
because `workbook.worksheets[0].id` may have any value.

## Worksheet State[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

```javascript
// make worksheet visible
worksheet.state = &#039;visible&#039;;

// make worksheet hidden
worksheet.state = &#039;hidden&#039;;

// make worksheet hidden from &#039;hide/unhide&#039; dialog
worksheet.state = &#039;veryHidden&#039;;
```

## Worksheet Properties[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

Worksheets support a property bucket to allow control over some features of the worksheet.

```javascript
// create new sheet with properties
const worksheet = workbook.addWorksheet(&#039;sheet&#039;, {properties:{tabColor:{argb:&#039;FF00FF00&#039;}}});

// create a new sheet writer with properties
const worksheetWriter = workbookWriter.addWorksheet(&#039;sheet&#039;, {properties:{outlineLevelCol:1}});

// adjust properties afterwards (not supported by worksheet-writer)
worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol = 2;
worksheet.properties.defaultRowHeight = 15;
```

**Supported Properties**

| Name             | Default    | Description |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| tabColor         | undefined  | Color of the tabs |
| outlineLevelCol  | 0          | The worksheet column outline level |
| outlineLevelRow  | 0          | The worksheet row outline level |
| defaultRowHeight | 15         | Default row height |
| defaultColWidth  | (optional) | Default column width |
| dyDescent        | 55         | TBD |

### Worksheet Metrics[⬆](#contents)&lt;!-- Link generated with jump2header --&gt;

Some new metrics have been added to Worksheet...

| Name              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| rowCount          | The total row size of the document. Equal to the row number of the last row that has values. |
| actualRowCount    | A count of the number of rows that have values. If a mid-document row is empty, it will not be included in the count. |
| columnCount       | The total column size of the document. Equal to the maximum cell count f

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

Look at the [Local Development Guide](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/advanced-topics/development) for instructions on setting up a local development environment.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Rollup&lt;/h1&gt;

## Overview

Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the standardized ES module format for code, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. ES modules let you freely and seamlessly combine the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. Rollup can optimize ES modules for faster native loading in modern browsers, or output a legacy module format allowing ES module workflows today.

## Quick Start Guide

Install with `npm install --global rollup`. Rollup can be used either through a [command line interface](https://rollupjs.org/command-line-interface/) with an optional configuration file or else through its [JavaScript API](https://rollupjs.org/javascript-api/). Run `rollup --help` to see the available options and parameters. The starter project templates, [rollup-starter-lib](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-lib) and [rollup-starter-app](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-app), demonstrate common configuration options, and more detailed instructions are available throughout the [user guide](https://rollupjs.org/introduction/).

### Commands

These commands assume the entry point to your application is named main.js, and that you&#039;d like all imports compiled into a single file named bundle.js.

For browsers:

```bash
# compile to a &lt;script&gt; containing a self-executing function
rollup main.js --format iife --name &quot;myBundle&quot; --file bundle.js
```

For Node.js:

```bash
# compile to a CommonJS module
rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js
```

For both browsers and Node.js:

```bash
# UMD format requires a bundle name
rollup main.js --format umd --name &quot;myBundle&quot; --file bundle.js
```

## Why

Developing software is usually easier if you break your project into smaller separate pieces, since that often removes unexpected interactions and dramatically reduces the complexity of the problems you&#039;ll need to solve, and simply writing smaller projects in the first place [isn&#039;t necessarily the answer](https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/small-modules-it-s-not-quite-that-simple-3ca532d65de4). Unfortunately, JavaScript has not historically included this capability as a core feature in the language.

This finally changed with ES modules support in JavaScript, which provides a syntax for importing and exporting functions and data so they can be shared between separate scripts. Most browsers and Node.js support ES modules. However, Node.js releases before 12.17 support ES modules only behind the `--experimental-modules` flag, and older browsers like Internet Explorer do not support ES modules at all. Rollup allows you to write your code using ES modules, and run your application even in environments that do not support ES modules natively. For environments that support them, Rollup can output optimized ES modules; for environments that don&#039;t, Rollup can compile your code to other formats such as CommonJS modules, AMD modules, and IIFE-style scripts. This means that you get to _write future-proof code_, and you also get the tremendous benefits of...

## Tree Shaking

In addition to enabling the use of ES modules, Rollup also statically analyzes and optimizes the code you are importing, and will exclude anything that isn&#039;t actually used. This allows you to build on top of existing tools and modules without adding extra dependencies or bloating the size of your project.

For example, with CommonJS, the _entire tool or library must be imported_.

```js
// import the entire utils object with CommonJS
var utils = require(&#039;node:utils&#039;);
var query = &#039;Rollup&#039;;
// use the ajax method of the utils object
utils.ajax(&#039;https://api.example.com?search=&#039; + query).then(handleResponse);
```

But with ES modules, instead of importing the whole `utils` object, we can just import the one `ajax` function we need:

```js
// import the ajax function with an ES import statement
import { ajax } from &#039;node:utils&#039;;

var query = &#039;Rollup&#039;;
// call the ajax function
ajax(&#039;https://api.example.com?search=&#039; + query).then(handleResponse);
```

Because Rollup includes the bare minimum, it results in lighter, faster, and less complicated libraries and applications. Since this approach is based on explicit `import` and `export` statements, it is vastly more effective than simply running an automated minifier to detect unused variables in the compiled output code.

## Compatibility

### Importing CommonJS

Rollup can import existing CommonJS modules [through a plugin](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs).

### Publishing ES Modules

To make sure your ES modules are immediately usable by tools that work with CommonJS such as Node.js and webpack, you can use Rollup to compile to UMD or CommonJS format, and then point to that compiled version with the `main` property in your `package.json` file. If your `package.json` file also has a `module` field, ES-module-aware tools like Rollup and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) will [import the ES module version](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module) directly.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>About
----- 

**drawio-desktop** is a diagramming desktop app based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that wraps the [core draw.io editor](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).

Download built binaries from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).

**Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don&#039;t change the code and accept it is provided &quot;as-is&quot;, you can use it for any purpose.

Security
--------

draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.

No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. There is a Content Security Policy in place on the web part of the interface to ensure external transmission cannot happen, even by accident.

Security and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no.

Support
-------

Support is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support for non-paying users.

Purchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop.

Developing
----------

**draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.git`

To run this:
1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo)
2. [internal use only] export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode.
3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`.

Note: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also.

To release:
1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin.
2. Wait for the builds to complete (https://travis-ci.org/jgraph/drawio-desktop and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidjgraph/drawio-desktop)
3. Go to https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases, edit the preview release.
4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr http://rfc3161timestamp.globalsign.com/advanced /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe`
5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe`
6. Add release notes
7. Publish release

*Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them.

Local Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io`
- Windows: `C:\Users\&lt;USER-NAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\draw.io\`

Not open-contribution
---------------------

draw.io is closed to contributions (unless a maintainer permits it, which is extremely rare).

The level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes 
can break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required 
is far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we&#039;d have 
to basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented.

We are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, &amp; feature requests. We do
not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we&#039;ve
made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for 
the long term viability of the project.

## What is Label Studio?

&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python &gt;=3.7 &lt;=3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you&#039;ve made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you&#039;re using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you&#039;re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

#### Run test suite
```bash
pip install -r deploy/requirements-test.txt
cd label_studio

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass)

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto
```


## What you get from Label Studio

![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it&#039;s tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/templates-categories.jpg&quot; /&gt;

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).

  Gatsby
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    The future of web development is here.
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  Gatsby is a free and open-source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. &lt;br /&gt; It combines the control and scalability of dynamically rendered sites with the speed of static-site generation, creating a whole new web of possibilities.

Gatsby helps professional developers efficiently create maintainable, highly-performant, content-rich websites.

- **Load Data From Anywhere.** Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.

- **Go Beyond Static Websites.** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.

- **Choose your Rendering Options.** You can choose alternative [rendering options](https://gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/rendering-options/), namely Deferred Static Generation (DSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), in addition to Static Site Generation (SSG) — on a per-page basis. This type of granular control allows you to optimize for performance and productivity without sacrificing one for the other.

- **Performance Is Baked In.** Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources, and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.

- **Use a Modern Stack for Every Site.** No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of whether the data is coming from the same backend.

- **Host at Scale for Pennies.** Gatsby sites don’t require servers, so you can host your entire site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be hosted entirely free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and other similar services.

- **Use Gatsby&#039;s Centralized Data Layer Everywhere.** With Gatsby&#039;s [Valhalla Content Hub](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/valhalla-content-hub/) you can bring Gatsby&#039;s data layer to any project. Making it accessible via a unified GraphQL API for building content sites, eCommerce platforms, and both native and web applications.

## 🚀 Ship your first Gatsby site in 5 Minutes

Click the link below to quickly try the workflow of developing, building, and deploying websites with Gatsby and Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&amp;utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=onboarding&amp;utm_content=oss)

At the end of this process, you&#039;ll have

1. a site working on Netlify
2. a new repository that is linked to that new site
3. as you push changes to your new repository, Netlify will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site!

## 💻 Get started with Gatsby locally in 5 Minutes

You can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

1. **Initialize a new project.**

   ```shell
   npm init gatsby
   ```

   Give it the name &quot;My Gatsby Site&quot;.

2. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your new site’s directory and start it up:

   ```shell
   cd my-gatsby-site/
   npm run develop
   ```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `my-gatsby-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.com/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/).

# Vision &amp; Philosophy

Our goal is simple: **to build the best web based file manager ever made. Period.** But &quot;best&quot; means different things to different people, and making Filestash modular is the only sane model to accomplish that. Anything that isn&#039;t a fundamental truth of the universe and might spark a debate belongs in a plugin.

This modularity is made possible by the magic of programming interfaces. For example, if you want a [Dropbox-like frontend for FTP](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9224), you will find out the [FTP plugin](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash/tree/master/server/plugin/plg_backend_ftp) simply implements this interface:
```go
type IBackend interface {
	Ls(path string) ([]os.FileInfo, error)           // list files in a folder
	Cat(path string) (io.ReadCloser, error)          // download a file
	Mkdir(path string) error                         // create a folder
	Rm(path string) error                            // remove something
	Mv(from string, to string) error                 // rename something
	Save(path string, file io.Reader) error          // save a file
	Touch(path string) error                         // create a file

	// I have omitted 2 other methods, a first one to enable connections reuse and
	// another one to declare what should the login form be like.
}
```

There are interfaces you can implement for every key component of Filestash: from storage, to authentication, authorisation, custom apps, search, thumbnailing, frontend patches, middleware, endpoint creation and a [few others](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash/blob/master/server/common/plugin.go).

To see what&#039;s currently installed in your instance, head over to [/about](https://demo.filestash.app/about). The inventory of plugins is [documented here](https://www.filestash.app/docs/plugin/).

# Roadmap

There are 2 major pieces of work currently underway:

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Making Filestash able to open virtually anything. Thanks to plugin, we&#039;re adding support for files your browser has never heard of, from astrophysics to embroidery patterns. Concretly we have added support for:
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://demo.filestash.app/assets/plugin/application_photography.zip&quot;&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt;: heif, nef, raf, tiff, raw, arw, sr2, srf, nrw, cr2, crw, x3f, pef, rw2, orf, mrw, mdc, mef, mos, dcr, kdc, 3fr, erf and srw&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Getting to v1.0. Filestash is already rock solid, it has been in active development for over 8 years. But the bar for v1.0 will be reached when Filestash is objectively better than Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box by every single measurable metric we care about. That&#039;s the mission.&lt;/li&gt;

## Demos

You can try Plyr in Codepen using our minimal templates: [HTML5 video](https://codepen.io/pen?template=bKeqpr), [HTML5 audio](https://codepen.io/pen?template=rKLywR), [YouTube](https://codepen.io/pen?template=GGqbbJ), [Vimeo](https://codepen.io/pen?template=bKeXNq). For Streaming we also have example integrations with: [Dash.js](https://codepen.io/pen?template=GRoogML), [Hls.js](https://codepen.io/pen?template=oyLKQb) and [Shaka Player](https://codepen.io/pen?template=ZRpzZO)

# Quick setup

## HTML

Plyr extends upon the standard [HTML5 media element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) markup so that&#039;s all you need for those types.

### HTML5 Video

```html
&lt;video id=&quot;player&quot; playsinline controls data-poster=&quot;/path/to/poster.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/video.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/video.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;!-- Captions are optional --&gt;
  &lt;track kind=&quot;captions&quot; label=&quot;English captions&quot; src=&quot;/path/to/captions.vtt&quot; srclang=&quot;en&quot; default /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
```

**Note**: The poster image should be specified using `data-poster`. This is to prevent it [being downloaded twice](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1531). If you&#039;re sure the image will be cached, you can still use the `poster` attribute for true progressive enhancement.

### HTML5 Audio

```html
&lt;audio id=&quot;player&quot; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/audio.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mp3&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/audio.ogg&quot; type=&quot;audio/ogg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
```

For YouTube and Vimeo players, Plyr uses progressive enhancement to enhance the default `&lt;iframe&gt;` embeds. Below are some examples. The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the embed responsive. You can add the `autoplay`, `loop`, `hl` (YouTube only) and `playsinline` (YouTube only) query parameters to the URL and they will be set as config options automatically. For YouTube, the `origin` should be updated to reflect the domain you&#039;re hosting the embed on, or you can opt to omit it.

### YouTube

We recommend [progressive enhancement](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) with the embedded players. You can elect to use an `&lt;iframe&gt;` as the source element (which Plyr will progressively enhance) or a bog standard `&lt;div&gt;` with two essential data attributes - `data-plyr-provider` and `data-plyr-embed-id`.

```html
&lt;div class=&quot;plyr__video-embed&quot; id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe
    src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTqVqk7FSmY?origin=https://plyr.io&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;playsinline=1&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot;
    allowfullscreen
    allowtransparency
    allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

_Note_: The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the player a responsive 16:9 (most common) iframe embed. When plyr itself kicks in, your custom `ratio` config option will be used.

Or the `&lt;div&gt;` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot; data-plyr-provider=&quot;youtube&quot; data-plyr-embed-id=&quot;bTqVqk7FSmY&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

_Note_: The `data-plyr-embed-id` can either be the video ID or URL for the media.

### Vimeo

Much the same as YouTube above.

```html
&lt;div class=&quot;plyr__video-embed&quot; id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe
    src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?loop=false&amp;amp;byline=false&amp;amp;portrait=false&amp;amp;title=false&amp;amp;speed=true&amp;amp;transparent=0&amp;amp;gesture=media&quot;
    allowfullscreen
    allowtransparency
    allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

Or the `&lt;div&gt;` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot; data-plyr-provider=&quot;vimeo&quot; data-plyr-embed-id=&quot;76979871&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

## JavaScript

You can use Plyr as an ES6 module as follows:

```js
import Plyr from &#039;plyr&#039;;

const player = new Plyr(&#039;#player&#039;);
```

Alternatively you can include the `plyr.js` script before the closing `&lt;/body&gt;` tag and then in your JS create a new instance of Plyr as below.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/plyr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const player = new Plyr(&#039;#player&#039;);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

See [initialising](#initializing) for more information on advanced setups.

You can use our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) for the JavaScript. There&#039;s 2 versions; one with and one without [polyfills](#polyfills). My recommendation would be to manage polyfills separately as part of your application but to make life easier you can use the polyfilled build.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.8.3/plyr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

...or...

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.8.3/plyr.polyfilled.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## CSS

Include the `plyr.css` stylesheet into your `&lt;head&gt;`.

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;path/to/plyr.css&quot; /&gt;
```

If you want to use our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) for the default CSS, you can use the following:

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.8.3/plyr.css&quot; /&gt;
```

## SVG Sprite

The SVG sprite is loaded automatically from our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)). To change this, see the [options](#options) below. For
reference, the CDN hosted SVG sprite can be found at `https://cdn.plyr.io/3.8.3/plyr.svg`.

### Self hosting

If you don&#039;t want to create a build system to include Plyr as an npm module, you can use the pre-built files. You have a few options:

- Download the files from the CDN links above, they&#039;re already minified.
- Download the files from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/plyr/dist/) or similar services.
- Build the project yourself using `npm i &amp;&amp; npm run build`, which installs the dependencies and spits out a build to `dist`.

# Ads

Plyr has partnered up with [vi.ai](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio) to offer monetization options for your videos. Getting setup is easy:

- [Sign up for a vi.ai account](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio)
- Grab your publisher ID from the code snippet
- Enable ads in the [config options](#options) and enter your publisher ID

Any questions regarding the ads can be sent straight to vi.ai and any issues with rendering raised through GitHub issues.

If you do not wish to use Vi, you can set your own `ads.tagUrl` [option](#options).

# Advanced

## Customizing the CSS

If you want to change any design tokens used for the rendering of the player, you can do so using [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

Here&#039;s a list of the properties and what they are used for:

| Name                                           | Description                                                                                             | Default / Fallback                                                    |

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

For information on using Node.js, see the [Node.js website][].

The Node.js project uses an [open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md). The
[OpenJS Foundation][] provides support for the project.

Contributors are expected to act in a collaborative manner to move
the project forward. We encourage the constructive exchange of contrary
opinions and compromise. The [TSC](./GOVERNANCE.md#technical-steering-committee)
reserves the right to limit or block contributors who repeatedly act in ways
that discourage, exhaust, or otherwise negatively affect other participants.

**This project has a [Code of Conduct][].**

## Support

Looking for help? Check out the
[instructions for getting support](.github/SUPPORT.md).

## Release types

* **Current**: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
  branch for its major version number (for example,
  [v22.x](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v22.x)). Node.js releases a new
  major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
  April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
  life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
  each October.
* **LTS**: Releases that receive Long Term Support, with a focus on stability
  and security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.
  LTS releases receive 12 months of _Active LTS_ support and a further 18 months
  of _Maintenance_. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered code names,
  beginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,
  except in some special circumstances.
* **Nightly**: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are
  changes. Use with caution.

Current and LTS releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). A
member of the Release Team [signs](#release-keys) each Current and LTS release.
For more information, see the
[Release README](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#readme).

### Download

Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
&lt;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&gt;.

#### Current and LTS releases

&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/release/&gt;

The [latest](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest/) directory is an
alias for the latest Current release. The latest-_codename_ directory is an
alias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the
[latest-hydrogen](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-hydrogen/)
directory contains the latest Hydrogen (Node.js 18) release.

#### Nightly releases

&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/&gt;

Each directory and filename includes the version (e.g., `v22.0.0`),
followed by the UTC date (e.g., `20240424` for April 24, 2024),
and the short commit SHA of the HEAD of the release (e.g., `ddd0a9e494`).
For instance, a full directory name might look like `v22.0.0-nightly20240424ddd0a9e494`.

#### API documentation

Documentation for the latest Current release is at &lt;https://nodejs.org/api/&gt;.
Version-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the
_docs_ subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at
&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/docs/&gt;.

### Verifying binaries

Download directories contain a `SHASUMS256.txt.asc` file with SHA checksums for the
files and the releaser PGP signature.

You can get a trusted keyring from nodejs/release-keys, e.g. using `curl`:

```bash
curl -fsLo &quot;/path/to/nodejs-keyring.kbx&quot; &quot;https://github.com/nodejs/release-keys/raw/HEAD/gpg/pubring.kbx&quot;
```

Alternatively, you can import the releaser keys in your default keyring, see
[Release keys](#release-keys) for commands to how to do that.

Then, you can verify the files you&#039;ve downloaded locally
(if you&#039;re using your default keyring, pass `--keyring=&quot;${GNUPGHOME:-~/.gnupg}/pubring.kbx&quot;`):

```bash
curl -fsO &quot;https://nodejs.org/dist/${VERSION}/SHASUMS256.txt.asc&quot; \
&amp;&amp; gpgv --keyring=&quot;/path/to/nodejs-keyring.kbx&quot; --output SHASUMS256.txt &lt; SHASUMS256.txt.asc \
&amp;&amp; shasum --check SHASUMS256.txt --ignore-missing
```

## Self-hosting Screenity

You can run Screenity locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here&#039;s how:

1. Download the latest Build.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/releases)
2. Load the extension by pasting `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it&#039;s a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the &quot;Load unpacked&quot; button and locate the folder.
4. That&#039;s it, you should now be able to use Screenity locally. [Follow these instructions](#enabling-save-to-google-drive) to set up the Google Drive integration.

## Creating a development version

&gt; ❗️ Note that the license has changed to [GPLv3](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/blob/master/LICENSE) for the current MV3 version (Screenity version 3.0.0 and higher). Make sure to read the license and the [Terms of Service](https://screenity.io/en/terms/) regarding intellectual property.

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is &gt;= **14**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Load the extension by going to `chrome://extensions/` , and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
6. Click on `Load unpacked extension`.
7. Select the `build` folder.

### Enabling Save to Google Drive

To enable the Google Drive Upload (authorization consent screen) you must change the client_id in the manifest.json file with your linked extension key.

You can create it accessing [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and selecting Create Credential &gt; OAuth Client ID &gt; Chrome App. To create a persistent extension key, you can follow the steps detailed [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/key).

&lt;/p&gt;

eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.

  &lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Demo on YouTube&quot; src=&quot;media/youtube-demo-teaser.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

Heavily inspired from the [TRON Legacy movie effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671) (especially the [Board Room sequence](https://gmunk.com/TRON-Board-Room)), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be *&quot;[DEX-UI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui) with less « art » and more « distributable software »&quot;*.

While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.

&lt;br&gt;

It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.

## Q&amp;A
#### How do I get it?
Click on the little badges under the eDEX logo at the top of this page, or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases) tab, or download it through [one of the available repositories](https://repology.org/project/edex-ui/versions) (Homebrew, AUR...).

Public release binaries are unsigned ([why](https://gaby.dev/posts/code-signing)). On Linux, you will need to `chmod +x` the AppImage file in order to run it.
#### I have a problem!
Search through the [Issues](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues) to see if yours has already been reported. If you&#039;re confident it hasn&#039;t been reported yet, feel free to open up a new one. If you see your issue and it&#039;s been closed, it probably means that the fix for it will ship in the next version, and you&#039;ll have to wait a bit.
#### Can you disable the keyboard/the filesystem display?
You can&#039;t disable them (yet) but you can hide them. See the `tron-notype` theme.
#### Why is the file browser saying that &quot;Tracking Failed&quot;? (Windows only)
On Linux and macOS, eDEX tracks where you&#039;re going in your terminal tab to display the content of the current folder on-screen.
Sadly, this is technically impossible to do on Windows right now, so the file browser reverts back to a &quot;detached&quot; mode. You can still use it to browse files &amp; directories and click on files to input their path in the terminal.
#### Can this run on a Raspberry Pi / ARM device?
We provide prebuilt arm64 builds. For other platforms, see [this issue comment](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/313#issuecomment-443465345), and the thread on issue [#818](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/818).
#### Is this repo actively maintained?
No, after a 3 years run, this project has been archived. See the [announcement](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases/tag/v2.2.8).
#### How did you make this?
Glad you&#039;re interested! See [#272](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/272).
#### This is so cool.
Thanks! If you feel like it, you can [follow me on Twitter](https://gaby.dev/twitter) to hear about new stuff I&#039;m making.

## Useful commands for the nerds

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the following instructions are meant for running eDEX from the latest unoptimized, unreleased, development version. If you&#039;d like to get stable software instead, refer to [these](#how-do-i-get-it) instructions.

#### Starting from source:
on *nix systems (You&#039;ll need the Xcode command line tools on macOS):
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-linux`
- `npm run start`

on Windows:
- start cmd or powershell **as administrator**
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-windows`
- `npm run start`

#### Building
Note: Due to native modules, you can only build targets for the host OS you are using.

- `npm install` (NOT `install-linux` or `install-windows`)
- `npm run build-linux` or `build-windows` or `build-darwin`

The script will minify the source code, recompile native dependencies and create distributable assets in the `dist` folder.

#### Getting the bleeding edge
If you&#039;re interested in running the latest in-development version but don&#039;t want to compile source code yourself, you can can get pre-built nightly binaries on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/actions): click the latest commits, and download the artifacts bundle for your OS.

## Credits
eDEX-UI&#039;s source code was primarily written by me, [Squared](https://github.com/GitSquared). If you want to get in touch with me or find other projects I&#039;m involved in, check out [my website](https://gaby.dev).

[PixelyIon](https://github.com/PixelyIon) helped me get started with Windows compatibility and offered some precious advice when I started to work on this project seriously.

[IceWolf](https://soundcloud.com/iamicewolf) composed the sound effects on v2.1.x and above. He makes really cool stuff, check out his music!

## Thanks
Of course, eDEX would never have existed if I hadn&#039;t stumbled upon the amazing work of [Seena](https://github.com/seenaburns) on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

This project uses a bunch of open-source libraries, frameworks and tools, see [the full dependency graph](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/network/dependencies).

I want to namely thank the developers behind [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) and [SmoothieCharts](https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie).

Huge thanks to [Rob &quot;Arscan&quot; Scanlon](https://github.com/arscan) for making the fantastic [ENCOM Globe](https://github.com/arscan/encom-globe), also inspired by the TRON: Legacy movie, and distributing it freely. His work really puts the icing on the cake.
