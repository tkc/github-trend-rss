## Mission

**The world is rushing to build AI systems. It is not engineering them.**

That gap is what we mean by AI engineering.

**AI engineering is the discipline of building efficient, reliable, safe, and robust intelligent systems that operate in the real world, not just models in isolation.**

**Our mission:** Establish AI engineering as a foundational discipline, alongside software engineering and computer engineering, by teaching how to design, build, and evaluate end to end intelligent systems. The long term impact of AI will be shaped by engineers who can turn ideas into working, dependable systems.

---

## What’s in this repo

This repository is the open learning stack for AI systems engineering.

It includes the textbook source, TinyTorch, hardware kits, and upcoming co-labs that connect principles to runnable code and real devices.

## What Makes This Different

This is a living textbook. We keep it updated as the field grows, with community input along the way.

AI may feel like it is moving at lightning speed, but the engineering building blocks that make it work do not change as quickly as the headlines. This project is built around those stable foundations.

Think of it like LEGO. New sets arrive all the time, but the bricks themselves stay the same. Once you learn how the bricks fit together, you can build anything. Here, those &quot;AI bricks&quot; are the solid systems principles that make AI work.

Whether you are reading a chapter, running a lab, or sharing feedback, you are helping make these ideas more accessible to the next learner.

### Research to Teaching Loop

We use the same loop for research and teaching: define the system problem, build a reference implementation, benchmark it, then turn it into curriculum and tooling so others can reproduce and extend it.

| Loop Step | Research Artifacts | Teaching Artifacts |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Measure** | Benchmarks, suites, metrics | Benchmarking chapter, assignments |
| **Build** | Reference systems, compilers, runtimes | TinyTorch modules, co-labs |
| **Deploy** | Hardware targets, constraints, reliability | Hardware labs, kits |

## Support This Work

We are working toward **1 million learners by 2030** so that AI engineering becomes a shared, teachable discipline, not a collection of isolated practices. Every star, share, and contribution helps move this effort forward.

### Why GitHub Stars Matter

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

*What gets measured gets improved.*

Each star is a learner, educator, or supporter who believes AI systems should be engineered with rigor and real world constraints in mind.

[![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/harvard-edge/cs249r_book?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;color=gold)](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/stargazers)

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;Date)

1 learner → 10 learners → 100 learners → 1,000 learners → **10,000 learners** → 100,000 learners → **1M learners**

&lt;/div&gt;

Stars are not the goal. They are a signal.

A visible, growing community makes it easier for universities, foundations, and industry partners to adopt this material, donate hardware, and fund workshops. That momentum lowers the barrier for the next institution, the next classroom, and the next cohort of learners.

Support raised through this signal flows into [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook) and funds concrete outcomes such as TinyML4D workshops, hardware kits for underserved classrooms, and the infrastructure required to keep this resource free and open.

One click can unlock the next classroom, the next contributor, and the next generation of AI engineers.

### Fund the Mission

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

All contributions go to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook), a transparent fund that supports educational outreach.

Thus, we recommend homepage be deployed behind a reverse proxy including authentication, SSL etc, and / or behind a VPN.

## With Docker

Using docker compose:

```yaml
services:
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    container_name: homepage
    environment:
      HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS: gethomepage.dev # required, may need port. See gethomepage.dev/installation/#homepage_allowed_hosts
      PUID: 1000 # optional, your user id
      PGID: 1000 # optional, your group id
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/app/config # Make sure your local config directory exists
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # optional, for docker integrations
    restart: unless-stopped
```

or docker run:

```bash
docker run --name homepage \
  -e HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=gethomepage.dev \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \

```bash
# Initialize once per feature
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;Implement authentication&quot; --claude

# Continue same feature (reuse hive)
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query &quot;auth&quot; --recent
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm &quot;Add password reset&quot; --continue-session
```

### **Pattern 2: Multi-Feature Project**
```bash
# Project initialization
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force --project-name &quot;my-app&quot;

# Feature 1: Authentication
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;auth-system&quot; --namespace auth --claude

# Feature 2: User management
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;user-mgmt&quot; --namespace users --claude
```

### **Pattern 3: Research &amp; Analysis**
```bash
# Start research session
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;Research microservices&quot; \
  --agents researcher,analyst --claude

# Check learned knowledge
npx claude-flow@alpha memory stats
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query &quot;microservices patterns&quot; --reasoningbank
```

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

### Introduction

Welcome to OpenSign, the premier open source docusign alternative - document e-signing solution designed to provide a secure, reliable and free alternative to commercial esign platforms like DocuSign, PandaDoc, SignNow, Adobe Sign, Smartwaiver, SignRequest, HelloSign &amp; Zoho sign. Our mission is to democratize the document signing process, making it accessible and straightforward for everyone.

---

### Features

- **Secure PDF E-Signing:** With the help of robust encryption algorithms, OpenSign™ ensures maximum security, privacy &amp; compatibility. Now sign unlimited documents even on the [cloud hosted free version of OpenSign](https://www.opensignlabs.com/).
- **Annotate Documents:** OpenSign™ allows you to annotate PDF documents with an advanced signing pad that allows hand drawn signatures, uploaded images, typed signatures &amp; saved signatures for the simplest open source document signing experience ever.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** OpenSign™ was built while keeping Intuitive design in mind for ease of use. Features like &quot;Sign yourself&quot;, &quot;Templates&quot;, &quot;One click signatures&quot; and &quot;OpenSign™ Drive&quot; makes it stand out of the crowd and even makes it better than a lot of so-called industry leaders. OpenSign intends to provide the best document signing experience in the open source ecosystem.
- **Multi-signer Support:** OpenSign&#039;s ability to invite multiple signers for signing along with the ability to invite by sharing signing links &amp; being able to enforce signing in a sequence makes it the only open source solution that is fully loaded and allows it to compete head-to-head with established players in e-signature space.
- **Email Unique Code(OTP) verification support for guest signers:** With OpenSign™, your documents are fully secure even when being signed by guest users. Guest signers can only sign the document after entering a unique code sent to their email address. 
- **&quot;Expiring Docs&quot; &amp; &quot;Rejection&quot;:** You can set documents to expire after certain number of days after which nobody will be able to sign. Not just this, OpenSign™ also allows signers to reject signing a document with a reason that will be promptly shared with the sender.
- **Beautiful email templates:** All document signing invitations, completion notifications &amp; reminders are formatted using great looking email templates. Not just this, you are even allowed to customise the email templates making your free document signing invitations look the way you always wanted them to be.
- **PDF Template Creation:** OpenSign™ allows you to create and store PDF document templates for repeated use thereby saving you a lot of time &amp; collect e-signatures seamlessly.
- **OpenSign™ Drive:** It is a centralised secure vault for your digital documents that makes storing, signing, organizing, sharing &amp; archieving your docs a breeze.
- **Audit Trails &amp; completion certificate:** Being a security focused solution, OpenSign™ makes it a top priority to save detailed logs for tracking document activities along with time-stamps, IP addresses, email IDs &amp; phone numbers. A completion certificate is generated as soon as document is completed which contains all the document related logs for added safety.
- **API Support:** OpenSign™ API allows seamless integration into existing systems and software. You can generate an API key from the app and refer the [official API docs](https://docs.opensignlabs.com/docs/API-docs/v1.1) to start integrating it in your existing applications.
- **Integrations:** The open source document signing experience becomes even more seamless because of integrations with various Cloud storage systems, CRMs &amp; enterprise platforms. We also have a Zapier integration that allows you to integrate it with virtually any application.

# Install with Docker

A preconfigured Docker image is available, including OCR and media conversion tools, listening on port 8080. If no PostgreSQL config is provided, the database is an embedded H2 database. The H2 embedded database should only be used for testing. For production usage use the provided PostgreSQL configuration (check the Docker Compose example)

**The default admin password is &quot;admin&quot;. Don&#039;t forget to change it before going to production.**

- Master branch, can be unstable. Not recommended for production use: `sismics/docs:latest`
- Latest stable version: `sismics/docs:v1.11`

The data directory is `/data`. Don&#039;t forget to mount a volume on it.

To build external URL, the server is expecting a `DOCS_BASE_URL` environment variable (for example https://teedy.mycompany.com)

## Available environment variables

- General
  - `DOCS_BASE_URL`: The base url used by the application. Generated url&#039;s will be using this as base.
  - `DOCS_GLOBAL_QUOTA`: Defines the default quota applying to all users.
  - `DOCS_BCRYPT_WORK`: Defines the work factor which is used for password hashing. The default is `10`. This value may be `4...31` including `4` and `31`. The specified value will be used for all new users and users changing their password. Be aware that setting this factor to high can heavily impact login and user creation performance.

- Admin
  - `DOCS_ADMIN_EMAIL_INIT`: Defines the e-mail-address the admin user should have upon initialization.
  - `DOCS_ADMIN_PASSWORD_INIT`: Defines the password the admin user should have upon initialization.  Needs to be a bcrypt hash.  **Be aware that `$` within the hash have to be escaped with a second `$`.**

- Database
  - `DATABASE_URL`: The jdbc connection string to be used by `hibernate`.
  - `DATABASE_USER`: The user which should be used for the database connection.
  - `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: The password to be used for the database connection.
  - `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE`: The pool size to be used for the database connection.

- Language
  - `DOCS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`: The language which will be used as default. Currently supported values are:
    - `eng`, `fra`, `ita`, `deu`, `spa`, `por`, `pol`, `rus`, `ukr`, `ara`, `hin`, `chi_sim`, `chi_tra`, `jpn`, `tha`, `kor`, `nld`, `tur`, `heb`, `hun`, `fin`, `swe`, `lav`, `dan`

- E-Mail
  - `DOCS_SMTP_HOSTNAME`: Hostname of the SMTP-Server to be used by Teedy.
  - `DOCS_SMTP_PORT`: The port which should be used.
  - `DOCS_SMTP_USERNAME`: The username to be used.
  - `DOCS_SMTP_PASSWORD`: The password to be used.

## Examples

In the following examples some passwords are exposed in cleartext. This was done in order to keep the examples simple. We strongly encourage you to use variables with an `.env` file or other means to securely store your passwords.


### Default, using PostgreSQL

```yaml
version: &#039;3&#039;
services:
# Teedy Application
  teedy-server:
    image: sismics/docs:v1.11
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      # Map internal port to host
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      # Base url to be used
      DOCS_BASE_URL: &quot;https://docs.example.com&quot;
      # Set the admin email
      DOCS_ADMIN_EMAIL_INIT: &quot;admin@example.com&quot;
      # Set the admin password (in this example: &quot;superSecure&quot;)
      DOCS_ADMIN_PASSWORD_INIT: &quot;$$2a$$05$$PcMNUbJvsk7QHFSfEIDaIOjk1VI9/E7IPjTKx.jkjPxkx2EOKSoPS&quot;
      # Setup the database connection. &quot;teedy-db&quot; is the hostname
      # and &quot;teedy&quot; is the name of the database the application
      # will connect to.
      DATABASE_URL: &quot;jdbc:postgresql://teedy-db:5432/teedy&quot;
      DATABASE_USER: &quot;teedy_db_user&quot;
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: &quot;teedy_db_password&quot;
      DATABASE_POOL_SIZE: &quot;10&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./docs/data:/data
    networks:
      - docker-internal
      - internet
    depends_on:
      - teedy-db

# DB for Teedy
  teedy-db:
    image: postgres:13.1-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - 5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: &quot;teedy_db_user&quot;
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: &quot;teedy_db_password&quot;
      POSTGRES_DB: &quot;teedy&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./docs/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

First off, clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/sismics/docs.git`
or download the sources from GitHub.

### Launch the build

From the root directory:

```console
mvn clean -DskipTests install
```

### Run a stand-alone version

From the `docs-web` directory:

```console
mvn jetty:run
```

### Build a .war to deploy to your servlet container

From the `docs-web` directory:

```console

This repository hosts the source code for [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io), a Linux virtual machine that runs in your browser.

Try out the new Alpine / Xorg / i3 graphical environment: [https://webvm.io/alpine.html](https://webvm.io/alpine.html)

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/welcome_to_WebVM_alpine_2024.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

WebVM is a server-less virtual environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. It&#039;s designed to be Linux ABI-compatible. It runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.

WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser. CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator.

# Enable networking

Modern browsers do not provide APIs to directly use TCP or UDP. WebVM provides networking support by integrating with Tailscale, a VPN network that supports WebSockets as a transport layer.

1.  Open the &quot;Networking&quot; panel from the side-bar
2.  Click &quot;Connect to Tailscale&quot; from the panel
3.  Log in to Tailscale (create an account if you don&#039;t have one)
4. Click &quot;Connect&quot; when prompted by Tailscale

WebVM now has access to machines in your own local Tailscale Network!

## the world wide web

If you would like to access the public internet, you will need an Exit Node. See [Tailscale Exit Nodes](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/) for detailed instructions.
(Depending on your network speed, you may need to wait a few moments for the Tailscale Wasm module to be downloaded.)
Once that is set up:
- Log in with your Tailscale credentials.
- Go back to the WebVM tab.
- The `Connect to Tailscale` button in the Networking side-panel should be replaced by your IP address.


## using authkey

As an alternative to manually logging in, you can add your tailscale auth Key at the end of the webvm URL.

`https://webvm.io/#authKey=&lt;your-key&gt;`

It is recommended to use an ephemeral key.

## Selfhosting your tailscale network

We also support [headscale](https://headscale.net/stable/), a selfhosted open source implementation of the Tailscale control server.

Though as headscale unfortunately doesn&#039;t support adding CORS headers. You will have to set up a proxy server to add them. Headscales instructions on doing so can be found [here](https://headscale.net/stable/ref/integration/reverse-proxy/#nginx). 

Once ready, add the following line to your `location /` block in your nginx config file.

``` Nginx
 if ($http_origin = &quot;https://webvm.io&quot;) {
            add_header &#039;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#039; &quot;$http_origin&quot;;
			add_header &#039;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&#039; &#039;true&#039; always;
        }
```


To log in to your headscale network add `#controlUrl=&lt;your-control-url&gt;` to the webVM url.

**Notes:**

- If self hosting, replace &quot;https://webvm.io&quot; with your own url.
- This is equivelant to the tailscale  `--login-server` command line option.
- If used with authkey, don&#039;t forget to seperate the URL fragments with a `&amp;` inbetween.


# Fork, deploy, customize

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fork_deploy_instructions.gif&quot; alt=&quot;deploy_instructions_gif&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

- Fork the repository.
- Enable Github pages in settings.
	- Click on `Settings`.
	- Go to the `Pages` section.
	- Select `Github Actions` as the source.
        - If you are using a custom domain, ensure `Enforce HTTPS` is enabled. 
- Run the workflow.
	- Click on `Actions`.
	- Accept the prompt. This is required only once to enable Actions for your fork.
	- Click on the workflow named `Deploy`.
	- Click `Run workflow` and then once more `Run workflow` in the menu.
- After a few seconds a new `Deploy` workflow will start, click on it to see details.
- After the workflow completes, which takes a few minutes, it will show the URL below the `deploy_to_github_pages` job.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/result.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; &gt;

You can now customize `dockerfiles/debian_mini` to suit your needs, or make a new Dockerfile from scratch. Use the `Path to Dockerfile` workflow parameter to select it.

- If you would like to use our full desktop Alpine image, you can find it&#039;s dockerfile [**here**](github.com/leaningtech/alpine-image).

- For more information on creating custom images, see our [Custom disk Image documentation](https://cheerpx.io/docs/guides/custom-images).


# Run WebVM locally with a custom Debian mini disk image

### 1. Clone the WebVM Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm.git
cd webvm
```

### 2. Download the Debian mini Ext2 image

Run the following command to download the Debian mini Ext2 image:

```sh
wget &quot;https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/releases/download/ext2_image/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2&quot;
```

(*You can also build your own disk image by selecting the **&quot;Upload GitHub release&quot;** workflow option*)

### 3. Update the configuration file

	Edit `config_public_terminal.js` to reference your local disk image:

- Replace: 
	
	`&quot;wss://disks.webvm.io/debian_large_20230522_5044875331.ext2&quot;`
	
	With:
	
	`&quot;/disk-images/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2&quot;`

	(*Use an absolute or relative URL pointing to the disk image location.*)


- Replace `&quot;cloud&quot;` with the correct disk image type: `&quot;bytes&quot;`

	
### 4. Build WebVM

Run the following commands to install dependencies and build WebVM:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

The output will be placed in the `build` directory.

### 5. Configure Nginx

- Create a directory for the disk image:

```sh
mkdir disk-images
mv debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2 disk-images/
```

- Modify your `nginx.conf` file to serve the disk image. Add the following location block:

```nginx
location /disk-images/ {
	root .;
	autoindex on;
}
```

### 6, Start Nginx

Run the following command to start Nginx:

```sh
nginx -p . -c nginx.conf
```

*Nginx will automatically serve the build directory.*

### 7. Access WebVM

Open a browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.

Enjoy your local WebVM!

# How to use Claude AI

To access Claude AI, you need an API key. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Create an account
- Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/login) and sign up with your e-mail. You&#039;ll receive a sign in link to the Anthropic Console. 

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/anthropic_signup.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

### 2. Get your API key
- Once logged in, navigate to **Get API keys**.
- Purchase the amount of credits you need. After completing the purchase, you&#039;ll be able to generate the key through the API console.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/anthropic_api_payment.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

### 3. Log in with your API key
- Navigate to your WebVM and hover over the robot icon. This will show the Claude AI Integration tab. For added convenience, you can click the pin button in the top right corner to keep the tab in place.
- You&#039;ll see a prompt where you can insert your Claude API key.
- Insert your key and press enter.

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/insert_key.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

### 4. Start using Claude AI
- Once your API key is entered, you can begin interacting with Claude AI by asking questions such as:

 __&quot;Solve the CTF challenge at `/home/user/chall1.bin.` Note that the binary reads from stdin.&quot;__

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/webvm_claude_ctf.gif&quot; alt=&quot;deploy_instructions_gif&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

**Important:** Your API key is private and should never be shared. We do not have access to your key, which is not only stored locally in your browser.

_Works on Windows/macOS/Linux._

Raspberry Pi (3, 4, Zero 2): [requires 64-bit OS](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/3) like Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu (Raspbian won&#039;t work since it&#039;s 32-bit).

## How to run
Easy option: [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (or [podman](https://podman-desktop.io/)) and run this command in a terminal:
```
docker run --rm -it -p 6080:6080 -v fgc:/fgc/data --pull=always ghcr.io/vogler/free-games-claimer
```

_This currently gives you a captcha challenge for epic-games. Until [issue #183](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/183) is fixed, it is recommended to just run `node epic-games` without docker (see below)._

This will run `node epic-games; node prime-gaming; node gog` - if you only want to claim games for one of the stores, you can override the default command by appending e.g. `node epic-games` at the end of the `docker run` command, or if you want several `bash -c &quot;node epic-games.js; node gog.js&quot;`.
Data (including json files with claimed games, codes to redeem, screenshots) is stored in the Docker volume `fgc`.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;I want to run without Docker or develop locally.&lt;/summary&gt;

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Clone/download this repository and `cd` into it in a terminal
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `pip install apprise` (or use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) if you have [problems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75608323/how-do-i-solve-error-externally-managed-environment-every-time-i-use-pip-3)) to install [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) if you want notifications
5. To get updates: `git pull; npm install`
6. Run `node epic-games`, `node prime-gaming`, `node gog`...

During `npm install` Playwright will download its Firefox to a cache in home ([doc](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#managing-browser-binaries)).
If you are missing some dependencies for the browser on your system, you can use `sudo npx playwright install firefox --with-deps`.

If you don&#039;t want to use Docker for quasi-headless mode, you could run inside a virtual machine, on a server, or you wake your PC at night to avoid being interrupted.
&lt;/details&gt;

## Usage
All scripts start an automated Firefox instance, either with the browser GUI shown or hidden (*headless mode*). By default, you won&#039;t see any browser open on your host system.

- When running inside Docker, the browser will be shown only inside the container. You can open http://localhost:6080 to interact with the browser running inside the container via noVNC (or use other VNC clients on port 5900).
- When running the scripts outside of Docker, the browser will be hidden by default; you can use `SHOW=1 ...` to show the UI (see options below).

When running the first time, you have to login for each store you want to claim games on.
You can login indirectly via the terminal or directly in the browser. The scripts will wait until you are successfully logged in.

There will be prompts in the terminal asking you to enter email, password, and afterwards some OTP (one time password / security code) if you have 2FA/MFA (two-/multi-factor authentication) enabled. If you want to login yourself via the browser, you can press escape in the terminal to skip the prompts.

After login, the script will continue claiming the current games. If it still waits after you are already logged in, you can restart it (and open an issue). If you run the scripts regularly, you should not have to login again.

### Configuration / Options
Options are set via [environment variables](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-an-environment-variable/) which allow for flexible configuration.

TODO: ~~On the first run, the script will guide you through configuration and save all settings to `data/config.env`. You can edit this file directly or run `node fgc config` to run the configuration assistant again.~~

Available options/variables and their default values:

See `src/config.js` for all options.

#### How to set options
You can add options directly in the command or put them in a file to load.

##### Docker
You can pass variables using `-e VAR=VAL`, for example `docker run -e EMAIL=foo@bar.baz -e NOTIFY=&#039;tgram://bottoken/ChatID&#039; ...` or using `--env-file fgc.env` where `fgc.env` is a file on your host system (see [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#env)). You can also `docker cp` your configuration file to `/fgc/data/config.env` in the `fgc` volume to store it with the rest of the data instead of on the host ([example](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25245#issuecomment-365980572)).
If you are using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/) (or Portainer etc.), you can put options in the `environment:` section.

##### Without Docker
On Linux/macOS you can prefix the variables you want to set, for example `EMAIL=foo@bar.baz SHOW=1 node epic-games` will show the browser and skip asking you for your login email. On Windows you have to use `set`, [example](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/314).
You can also put options in `data/config.env` which will be loaded by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

### Notifications
The scripts will try to send notifications for successfully claimed games and any errors like needing to log in or encountered captchas (should not happen).

[apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) is used for notifications and offers many services including Pushover, Slack, Telegram, SMS, Email, desktop and custom notifications.
You just need to set `NOTIFY` to the notification services you want to use, e.g. `NOTIFY=&#039;mailto://myemail:mypass@gmail.com&#039; &#039;pbul://o.gn5kj6nfhv736I7jC3cj3QLRiyhgl98b&#039;` - refer to their list of services and [examples](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#command-line-usage).

### Automatic login, two-factor authentication
If you set the options for email, password and OTP key, there will be no prompts and logins should happen automatically. This is optional since all stores should stay logged in since cookies are refreshed.
To get the OTP key, it is easiest to follow the store&#039;s guide for adding an authenticator app. You should also scan the shown QR code with your favorite app to have an alternative method for 2FA.

- **Epic Games**: visit [password &amp; security](https://www.epicgames.com/account/password), enable &#039;third-party authenticator app&#039;, copy the &#039;Manual Entry Key&#039; and use it to set `EG_OTPKEY`.
- **Prime Gaming**: visit Amazon &#039;Your Account › Login &amp; security&#039;, 2-step verification › Manage › Add new app › Can&#039;t scan the barcode, copy the bold key and use it to set `PG_OTPKEY`
- **GOG**: only offers OTP via email
&lt;!-- - **Xbox**: visit [additional security](https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional) &gt; Add a new way to sign in or verify &gt; Use an app &gt; Set up a different Authenticator app &gt; I can&#039;t scan the bar code &gt; copy the bold key and use it to set `XBOX_OTPKEY` --&gt;

Beware that storing passwords and OTP keys as clear text may be a security risk. Use a unique/generated password! TODO: maybe at least offer to base64 encode for storage.

### Epic Games Store
Run `node epic-games` (locally or in Docker).

### Amazon Prime Gaming
Run `node prime-gaming` (locally or in Docker).

Claiming the Amazon Games works out-of-the-box, however, for games on external stores you need to either link your account or redeem a key.

- Stores that require account linking: Epic Games, Battle.net, Origin.
- Stores that require redeeming a key: GOG.com, Microsoft Games, Legacy Games.
  
  Keys and URLs are printed to the console, included in notifications and saved in `data/prime-gaming.json`. A screenshot of the page with the key is also saved to `data/screenshots`.
  [TODO](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/5): ~~redeem keys on external stores.~~

&lt;!-- ### Xbox Games With Gold --&gt;
&lt;!-- Run `node xbox` (locally or in docker). --&gt;

### Run periodically
#### How often?
Epic Games usually has two free games *every week*, before Christmas every day.
Prime Gaming has new games *every month* or more often during Prime days.
GOG usually has one new game every couples of weeks.
Unreal Engine has new assets to claim *every first Tuesday of a month*.
&lt;!-- Xbox usually has two games *every month*. --&gt;

It is safe to run the scripts every day.

#### How to schedule?
The container/scripts will claim currently available games and then exit.
If you want it to run regularly, you have to schedule the runs yourself:

- Linux/macOS: `crontab -e` ([example](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/discussions/56))
- macOS: [launchd](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132955/how-do-i-set-a-task-to-run-every-so-often)
- Windows: [task scheduler](https://active-directory-wp.com/docs/Usage/How_to_add_a_cron_job_on_Windows/Scheduled_tasks_and_cron_jobs_on_Windows/index.html) ([example](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/wiki/%5BHowTo%5D-Schedule-runs-on-Windows)), [other options](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132971/what-is-the-windows-version-of-cron), or just put the command in a `.bat` file in Autostart if you restart often...
- any OS: use a process manager like [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/restart-strategies/)
- Docker Compose `command: bash -c &quot;node epic-games; node prime-gaming; node gog; echo sleeping; sleep 1d&quot;` additionally add `restart: unless-stopped` to it.

TODO: ~~add some server-mode where the script just keeps running and claims games e.g. every day.~~

### Problems?

Check the open [issues](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues) and comment there or open a new issue.

If you&#039;re a developer, you can use `PWDEBUG=1 ...` to [inspect](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector) which opens a debugger where you can step through the script.


## History/DevLog
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

Tried [epicgames-freebies-claimer](https://github.com/Revadike/epicgames-freebies-claimer), but had problems since epicgames introduced hcaptcha (see [issue](https://github.com/Revadike/epicgames-freebies-claimer/issues/172)).

Played around with puppeteer before, now trying newer https://playwright.dev which is pretty similar.
Playwright Inspector and `codegen` to generate scripts are nice, but failed to generate the right code for clicking a button in an iframe.

Added [main.spec.ts](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/e5ce7916ab6329cfc7134677c4d89c2b3fa3ba97#diff-d18d03e9c407a20e05fbf03cbd6f9299857740544fb6b50d6a70b9c6fbc35831) which was the test script generated by `npx playwright codegen` with manual fix for clicking buttons in the created iframe. Can be executed by `npx playwright test`. The test runner has options `--debug` and `--timeout` and can execute typescript which is nice. However, this only worked up to the button &#039;I Agree&#039;, and then showed an hcaptcha.

Added [main.captcha.js](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/e5ce7916ab6329cfc7134677c4d89c2b3fa3ba97#diff-d18d03e9c407a20e05fbf03cbd6f9299857740544fb6b50d6a70b9c6fbc35831) which uses beta of `playwright-extra@next` and `@extra/recaptcha@next` (from [comment on puppeteer-extra](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/pull/303#issuecomment-775277480)).
However, `playwright-extra` seems to be old and missing `:has-text` selector (fixed [here](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/ba97a0e840b65f4476cca18e28d8461b0c703420)) and `page.frameLocator`, so the script did not run without adjustments.
Also, solving via [2captcha](https://2captcha.com?from=13225256) is a paid service which takes time and may be unreliable.
&lt;!-- Alternative: https://anti-captcha.com --&gt;

Added [main.stealth.js](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/64d0ba8ce71baec3947d1b64acd567befcb39340#diff-f70d3bd29df4a343f11062a97063953173491ce30fe34f69a0fc52517adbf342) which uses the stealth plugin without `playwright-extra` wrapper but up-to-date `playwright` (from [comment](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/issues/454#issuecomment-917437212)).
The listed evasions are enough to not show an hcaptcha. Script claimed game successfully in non-headless mode.

Removed `main.captcha.js`.
Using Playwright Test (`main.spec.ts`) instead of Library (`main.stealth.js`) has the advantage of free CLI like `--debug` and `--timeout`.
&lt;!-- TODO: check if stealth plugin can be setup with `contextOptions` ([doc](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#more-browser-and-context-options)). --&gt;

Button selectors should preferably use text in order to be more stable against changes in the DOM.

Renamed repository from epicgames-claimer to free-games-claimer since a script for Amazon Prime Gaming was also added. Removed all old scripts in favor of just `epic-games.js` and `prime-gaming.js`.

epic games: `headless` mode gets hcaptcha challenge. More details/references in [issue](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/2).

https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/pull/11 introduced a Dockerfile for running non-headless inside the container via xvfb which makes it headless for the host running the container.

v1.0 Standalone scripts node epic-games and node prime-gaming using Chromium.

Changed to Firefox for all scripts since Chromium led to captchas. Claiming then also worked in headless mode without Docker.

Added options via env vars, configurable in `data/config.env`.

Added OTP generation via otplib for automatic login, even with 2FA.

Added notifications via [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise).
&lt;/details&gt;

1. token.json格式说明：

模板文件json/tokentemplate.json

特别警告：据传阿里要求使用者不得使用多线程加速方式使用阿里云盘资源，若并发连接数超过10有可能导致被限制访问或封禁帐号的处理，所以下方线程限制设置超过10所需承担的风险请使用者自行斟酌。

特别警告2：迅雷云盘限制极为严格，不要尝试单token多用户异地使用，或多线程使用，随时可能封号。

可以透过配置中的“网盘及弹幕配置”的视频源来实现快捷方便的获取32位token及opentoken的功能。在“网盘及弹幕配置”中扫过任何一个OpenToken后，会自动激活“转存原画”功能

提示：如果遇到极速GO原画反复快速报错，不一定是被封号，可尝试杀掉播放器重启，或重启整个播放设备解决。

提示2：如果遇到“转存原画”速度被限制在2M左右，那麽请尝试在阿里云盘APP里退出登录，然后重新登录，然后删除播放设备SD卡的TV目

Templates are the core of the [nuclei scanner](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) which powers the actual scanning engine.
This repository stores and houses various templates for the scanner provided by our team, as well as contributed by the community.
We hope that you also contribute by sending templates via **pull requests** or [Github issues](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=submit-template.md&amp;title=%5Bnuclei-template%5D+) to grow the list.


## Nuclei Templates overview


An overview of the nuclei template project, including statistics on unique tags, author, directory, severity, and type of templates. The table below contains the top ten statistics for each matrix; an expanded version of this is [available here](TEMPLATES-STATS.md), and also available in [JSON](TEMPLATES-STATS.json) format for integration.
