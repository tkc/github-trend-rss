## Architecture
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75decf47-3a37-446a-a672-d497d155f464)

The image depicts the **Pixels Reference Solution Architecture**, which outlines a data processing and analytics framework designed for healthcare or imaging applications. Here&#039;s a breakdown of its components:

### **Key Functional Areas**
1. **AI/BI Analytics**: Supports cohort building and natural language-based analysis.
   
2. **Lakehouse Apps**: Includes an OHIF Viewer for labeling and customer-specific applications.

3. **Deep Learning**: Facilitates active learning and customer model training.

4. **Realtime Inferencing**: Implements MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) for segmentation integration with the OHIF viewer. Customer provided proprietary models can be easily plugged in.

### **Data Flow: Batch, Incremental, Streaming Lakeflow**
The architecture processes data in stages:
1. **Acquire**: from data in ADLS, S3, GCS cloud storage as governed by Unity Catalog (UC) Volumes.  Based on customer demand, due to the composible nature of the solution accelerator, sources VNA, PACS, CIFS, AWS HealthImaging can be added as needed.
   
2. **Ingest**:  Ultimately all the DICOM files are ingested. Ingesting and producing Nifti file formats are currently on the roadmap.

3. **Extract &amp; Index**: Unzips files, storing the extracted DICOM files into a UC volume. All of the DICOM metadata tags are extracted and stored in Databricks Data Intelligence Platform tables.

4. **Protect – Metadata**: Applies PHI (Protected Health Information) redaction via format preserving encryption to all necessary tags.

5. **Protect – Image**: Ensures PHI redaction for pixel-level data. This is under active integration based on work Databricks has done in previous solution accelerators.

6. **Inferencing**: Utilizes industry-standard models pre-trained MONAI open source models sponsored by NVIDIA. Similarly, customers can fine tune the MONAI models or bring their own segmentation or featurization models.

### **Supporting Layers**
- **Governance Layer**: Unity Catalog provides data access controls, automatic capture of data lineage (including models)
  
- **Customer’s Cloud Storage**: Stores object indexes, folders, and ML models in open formats in customer&#039;s account.
  
- **Open Access**: Provides APIs, SQL connections, Spark integration, and credential vending via Delta Sharing.

This architecture is designed to handle healthcare imaging data securely while enabling advanced analytics and AI-driven insights.

## Getting started

1. To run this accelerator, [clone](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/repos/git-operations-with-repos) this repo into a Databricks workspace. 

2. Attach a notebook to Serverless Compute or a cluster (&gt;=DBR 14.3 LTS)
3. Run [`config/setup.py`]($./config/setup) from the notebook. This will install the pixels package onto your workspace


## Run pipeline as a job
1. Attach the [`RUNME`]($./RUNME) notebook to Serverless Compute or a cluster (&gt;=DBR 14.3 LTS). 2. Execute the notebook via Run-All. You can configure the notebook tasks run by the job in `job_json`
A multi-step-job describing the accelerator pipeline will be created, and the link will be provided. The cost associated with running the accelerator is the user&#039;s responsibility.

## Incremental processing
Pixels allows you to ingest DICOM files in a streaming fashion using [autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/en/ingestion/auto-loader/unity-catalog.html) capability.
To enable incremental processing you need to set `streaming` and `streamCheckpointBasePath` as follows:
```python
catalog_df = catalog.catalog(path, streaming=True, streamCheckpointBasePath=&lt;checkpointPath&gt;)
```

## Built-in unzip
Automatically extracts zip files in the defined volume path.
If extractZip is not enabled then zip files will be ignored.
To enable unzip capability you need to set `extractZip`. The parameter `extractZipBasePath` is optional and the default path will be volume + /unzipped/
```python
catalog_df = catalog.catalog(path, extractZip=True, extractZipBasePath=&lt;unzipPath&gt;)
```

## Metadata Anonymization
Pixels provides a feature to anonymize DICOM metadata to ensure patient privacy and compliance with regulations. This feature can be enabled during the cataloging process. An example can be explored in the [03-Metadata-DeIdentification](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/03-Metadata-DeIdentification.py) notebook.

To enable metadata anonymization, you can use the following extractor:
```python
metadata_df = DicomMetaAnonymizerExtractor(
   catalog,
   anonym_mode=&quot;METADATA&quot;,
   fp_key=&lt;fp_key&gt;, #ONLY HEX STRING ALLOWED - 128, 192 or 256 bits
   fp_tweak=&lt;fp_tweak&gt;,   #ONLY HEX STRING ALLOWED - 64 bits
   anonymization_base_path=&lt;anonym_path&gt;
).transform(catalog_df)
```
`fp_key` is the format preserving encryption key used to ensure that the anonymization process is consistent across different runs. This key is used to generate pseudonyms for sensitive data fields, ensuring that the same input value always maps to the same pseudonym. This is useful for maintaining the ability to link records across datasets without revealing the original sensitive information.

`fp_tweak` is an optional parameter that can be used to add an additional layer of randomness to the pseudonymization process. This can be useful for further enhancing privacy.

By setting the `anonym_mode` parameter to `&quot;METADATA&quot;`, the DICOM metadata will be anonymized during the ingestion process. This ensures that sensitive patient information is not stored in the catalog.
The default configuration will save the anonymized DICOM files under `anonymization_base_path` property&#039;s path.

## OHIF Viewer
Inside `dbx.pixels` resources folder, a pre-built version of [OHIF Viewer](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers) with Databricks and [Unity Catalog Volumes](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-volumes.html) extension is provided. 

All the catalog entries will be available in an easy to use study list.
![Catalog](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/images/ohif_catalog_view.png?raw=true)
Fast and multiple-layer visualization capability.
![CT_View](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/images/ohif_mr_view.png?raw=true)

To start the OHIF Viewer web app you need to:
 - Execute the [06-OHIF-Viewer](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/06-OHIF-Viewer.py) inside a Databricks workspace.
 - Set the `table` parameter to the full name of your Pixels catalog table. Ex: `main.pixels_solacc.object_catalog`
 - Set the `sqlWarehouseID`parameter to execute the queries required to collect the records. It&#039;s the final section of the `HTTP path` in the `Connection details` tab. Use [Serverless](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/sql/warehouse-types.html#sql-warehouse-types) for best performance.

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/images/sqlWarehouseID.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;sqlWarehouseID&quot;/&gt;

 - Use the link generated in the last notebook to access the OHIF viewer page.

## Save measurements and segmentations
The OHIF Viewer allows you to save back to Databricks the measurements and the segmentations created in the viewer.
The metadata will be stored in the object_catalog, and the generated dicom files in the volume under the path `/ohif/exports/`.

## MONAILabel Integration

[MONAILabel](https://monai.io/label.html) is an open-source tool designed for interactive medical image labeling. It supports various annotation tasks such as segmentation and classification, providing a seamless experience when integrated with viewers like OHIF that is already available in this solution accelerator.

![MONAI_BTN](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/images/monailabel_result.png?raw=true)
Once the server is running, you can use the OHIF Viewer to interact with your medical images. This integration allows you to leverage advanced annotation capabilities directly within your Databricks environment.

### Key Features
 - Interactive Annotation: Use AI-assisted tools for efficient labeling.
 - Seamless Integration: Work directly within Databricks using a web-based viewer.
 - Customizable Workflows: Tailor the annotation process to fit specific research needs.

### MONAILabel Setup Instructions
To execute the MONAILabel server it is mandatory to use a cluster with Databricks Runtime Version of `14.3 LTS ML`. For the best performance use a [GPU-Enabled compute](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/gpu.html#gpu-enabled-compute).
#### Start the MONAILabel server
 - Execute the [05-MONAILabel](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/05-MONAILabel.py) inside a Databricks workspace.
 - Set the `table` parameter to the full name of your Pixels catalog table. Ex: `main.pixels_solacc.object_catalog`
 - Set the `sqlWarehouseID`parameter to the DBSQL Warehouse ID, needed to run queries required to collect the records. Use [Serverless](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/sql/warehouse-types.html#sql-warehouse-types) for best performance.
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/images/sqlWarehouseID.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;sqlWarehouseID&quot;&gt;
#### Open the OHIF Viewer
 - Execute the notebook [06-OHIF-Viewer](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/06-OHIF-Viewer.py) to start the OHIF Viewer with the MONAILabel extension and open the generated link.
 - Select the preferred CT scan study and press the `MONAI Label` button.

#### Connect, execute and save
 - Connect the MONAILabel server using the refresh button.

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/images/monailabel_server.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;MONAI_SERVER&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
 - Execute an auto-segmentation task using the Run button and wait for the results to be displayed.

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/images/monailabel_autosegm.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;MONAI_AUTOSEG&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;/&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
 - Save the final result metadata in the catalog and the generated dicom file in the volume under the path `/ohif/exports/` using the button `Export DICOM SEG`.

This setup enhances your medical image analysis workflow by combining Databricks&#039; computing power with MONAILabel&#039;s sophisticated annotation tools.

### Model Serving Instructions

To deploy the MONAILabel server in a Model Serving endpoint we prepared [ModelServing](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/pixels/blob/main/monailabel_model/ModelServing.py), a Databricks notebook designed to initialize the Databricks customized version of the **MONAILabel server** that wraps the server in an **MLflow Python custom model** and registers it for use in a **serving endpoint**.

#### Key Features

- **Model Creation**: Utilizes the MONAILabel auto segmentation model on CT AXIAL images.
- **Unity Catalog Integration**: Adds the model to the Unity Catalog for organized management.
- **Serving Endpoint Deployment**: Deploys the model in a serving endpoint for real-time inference.

#### Auto Segmentation with Lakehouse App and Serving Endpoint

## Working with Unity Catalog
Unity Catalog (UC) [volumes](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/create-volumes.html) are the recommended approach for providing access to and governing non-tabular data assets in a cloud object storage locations, including DICOM files. Volumes are accessed by using the following format for the path that is passed to the pixels `Catalog` object - 
```
/Volumes/&lt;catalog&gt;/&lt;schema&gt;/&lt;volume&gt;/&lt;path-level-1&gt;/...
```
where `&lt;catalog&gt;`, `&lt;schema&gt;` and `&lt;volume&gt;` reflect the three-level namespace of Unity Catalog. The path field returned by the `Catalog` object reflects the volume file path listed above and subsequent metadata and thumbnail extraction operations will use volumes for accessing files.

DICOM file Ingestion works with Shared, Dedicated and Serverless Compute types.

## About DICOM
![DICOM Image processing](https://dicom.offis.uni-oldenburg.de/images/dicomlogo.gif)
[Per OFFIS computer science institute](https://dicom.offis.uni-oldenburg.de/en/general/dicom-introduction/) 

DICOM® — Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine — is the international standard for medical images and related information. It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use.

DICOM® is implemented in almost every radiology, cardiology imaging, and radiotherapy device (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), and increasingly in devices in other medical domains such as ophthalmology and dentistry. With hundreds of thousands of medical imaging devices in use, DICOM® is one of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging Standards in the world. There are literally billions of DICOM® images currently in use for clinical care.

Since its first publication in 1993, DICOM® has revolutionized the practice of radiology, allowing the replacement of X-ray film with a fully digital workflow. Much as the Internet has become the platform for new consumer information applications, DICOM® has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that have “changed the face of clinical medicine”. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM® is the standard that makes medical imaging work — for doctors and for patients.

DICOM® is recognized by the International Organization for Standardization as the ISO 12052 standard.

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.

  &lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Demo on YouTube&quot; src=&quot;media/youtube-demo-teaser.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

Heavily inspired from the [TRON Legacy movie effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671) (especially the [Board Room sequence](https://gmunk.com/TRON-Board-Room)), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be *&quot;[DEX-UI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui) with less « art » and more « distributable software »&quot;*.

While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.

&lt;br&gt;

It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.

## Q&amp;A
#### How do I get it?
Click on the little badges under the eDEX logo at the top of this page, or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases) tab, or download it through [one of the available repositories](https://repology.org/project/edex-ui/versions) (Homebrew, AUR...).

Public release binaries are unsigned ([why](https://gaby.dev/posts/code-signing)). On Linux, you will need to `chmod +x` the AppImage file in order to run it.
#### I have a problem!
Search through the [Issues](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues) to see if yours has already been reported. If you&#039;re confident it hasn&#039;t been reported yet, feel free to open up a new one. If you see your issue and it&#039;s been closed, it probably means that the fix for it will ship in the next version, and you&#039;ll have to wait a bit.
#### Can you disable the keyboard/the filesystem display?
You can&#039;t disable them (yet) but you can hide them. See the `tron-notype` theme.
#### Why is the file browser saying that &quot;Tracking Failed&quot;? (Windows only)
On Linux and macOS, eDEX tracks where you&#039;re going in your terminal tab to display the content of the current folder on-screen.
Sadly, this is technically impossible to do on Windows right now, so the file browser reverts back to a &quot;detached&quot; mode. You can still use it to browse files &amp; directories and click on files to input their path in the terminal.
#### Can this run on a Raspberry Pi / ARM device?
We provide prebuilt arm64 builds. For other platforms, see [this issue comment](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/313#issuecomment-443465345), and the thread on issue [#818](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/818).
#### Is this repo actively maintained?
No, after a 3 years run, this project has been archived. See the [announcement](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases/tag/v2.2.8).
#### How did you make this?
Glad you&#039;re interested! See [#272](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/272).
#### This is so cool.
Thanks! If you feel like it, you can [follow me on Twitter](https://gaby.dev/twitter) to hear about new stuff I&#039;m making.

## Useful commands for the nerds

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the following instructions are meant for running eDEX from the latest unoptimized, unreleased, development version. If you&#039;d like to get stable software instead, refer to [these](#how-do-i-get-it) instructions.

#### Starting from source:
on *nix systems (You&#039;ll need the Xcode command line tools on macOS):
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-linux`
- `npm run start`

on Windows:
- start cmd or powershell **as administrator**
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-windows`
- `npm run start`

#### Building
Note: Due to native modules, you can only build targets for the host OS you are using.

- `npm install` (NOT `install-linux` or `install-windows`)
- `npm run build-linux` or `build-windows` or `build-darwin`

The script will minify the source code, recompile native dependencies and create distributable assets in the `dist` folder.

#### Getting the bleeding edge
If you&#039;re interested in running the latest in-development version but don&#039;t want to compile source code yourself, you can can get pre-built nightly binaries on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/actions): click the latest commits, and download the artifacts bundle for your OS.

## Credits
eDEX-UI&#039;s source code was primarily written by me, [Squared](https://github.com/GitSquared). If you want to get in touch with me or find other projects I&#039;m involved in, check out [my website](https://gaby.dev).

[PixelyIon](https://github.com/PixelyIon) helped me get started with Windows compatibility and offered some precious advice when I started to work on this project seriously.

[IceWolf](https://soundcloud.com/iamicewolf) composed the sound effects on v2.1.x and above. He makes really cool stuff, check out his music!

## Thanks
Of course, eDEX would never have existed if I hadn&#039;t stumbled upon the amazing work of [Seena](https://github.com/seenaburns) on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

This project uses a bunch of open-source libraries, frameworks and tools, see [the full dependency graph](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/network/dependencies).

I want to namely thank the developers behind [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) and [SmoothieCharts](https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie).

Huge thanks to [Rob &quot;Arscan&quot; Scanlon](https://github.com/arscan) for making the fantastic [ENCOM Globe](https://github.com/arscan/encom-globe), also inspired by the TRON: Legacy movie, and distributing it freely. His work really puts the icing on the cake.

## Example cases

- **Universities, schools, education.** Administrators and editors keep what content will be published, students are not distracted with advertisements and irrelevant content, plus they have the ability to select either to stream or download content.
- **Organization sensitive content.** In cases where content is sensitive and cannot be uploaded to external sites.
- **Build a great community.** MediaCMS can be customized (URLs, logos, fonts, aesthetics) so that you create a highly customized video portal for your community!
- **Personal portal.** Organize, categorize and host your content the way you prefer.


## Philosophy

We believe there&#039;s a need for quality open source web applications that can be used to build community portals and support collaboration.
We have three goals for MediaCMS: a) deliver all functionality one would expect from a modern system, b) allow for easy installation and maintenance, c) allow easy customization and addition of features.


## License

[![Deploy on Elestio](https://elest.io/images/logos/deploy-to-elestio-btn.png)](https://elest.io/open-source/mediacms)

## Hardware considerations

For a small to medium installation, with a few hours of video uploaded daily, and a few hundreds of active daily users viewing content, 4GB Ram / 2-4 CPUs as minimum is ok. For a larger installation with many hours of video uploaded daily, consider adding more CPUs and more Ram.

In terms of disk space, think of what the needs will be. A general rule is to multiply by three the size of the expected uploaded videos (since the system keeps original versions, encoded versions plus HLS), so if you receive 1G of videos daily and maintain all of them, you should consider a 1T disk across a year (1G * 3 * 365).

In order to support automatic transcriptions through Whisper, consider more CPUs.

## Installation / Maintanance

There are two ways to run MediaCMS, through Docker Compose and through installing it on a server via an automation script that installs and configures all needed services. Find the related pages:

- [Single Server](docs/admins_docs.md#2-server-installation) page

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Core`        | Core classes, describing the structure of a game and tools to implement the IDE and work with GDevelop games.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `GDJS`        | The game engine, written in TypeScript, using PixiJS and Three.js for 2D and 3D rendering (WebGL), powering all GDevelop games.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `GDevelop.js` | Bindings of `Core`, `GDJS` and `Extensions` to JavaScript (with WebAssembly), used by the IDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `newIDE`      | The game editor, written in JavaScript with React, Electron, PixiJS and Three.js.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Extensions`  | Built-in extensions for the game engine, providing objects, behaviors and new features. For example, this includes the physics engines running in WebAssembly (Box2D or Jolt Physics for 3D). All the [official and experimental extensions are on this repository](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-extensions). [Community extensions are available here](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-community-list). |

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]\
&gt; We ask that all users read our [legal disclaimer](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/DISCLAIMER.md) before using icons from Simple Icons.

### General Usage

Icons can be downloaded as SVGs directly from [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org) - simply click the download button of the icon you want, and the download will start automatically.

### CDN Usage

Icons can be served from a CDN such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/simple-icons) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/simple-icons/). Simply use the `simple-icons` npm package and specify a version in the URL like the following:

```html
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v16/icons/[ICON SLUG].svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/simple-icons@v16/icons/[ICON SLUG].svg&quot; /&gt;
```

Where `[ICON SLUG]` is replaced by the [slug] of the icon you want to use, for example:

```html
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v16/icons/simpleicons.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/simple-icons@v16/icons/simpleicons.svg&quot; /&gt;
```

These examples use the latest major version. This means you won&#039;t receive any updates following the next major release. You can use `@latest` instead to receive updates indefinitely. However, this will result in a `404` error if the icon is removed.

#### CDN with colors

We also provide a CDN service which allows you to use colors.

```html
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/[ICON SLUG]&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/[ICON SLUG]/[COLOR]&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/[ICON SLUG]/[COLOR]/[DARK_MODE_COLOR]&quot; /&gt;
```

Where `[COLOR]` is optional, and can be replaced by the [hex colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color) or [CSS keywords](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords) of the icon you want to use. The color is defaulted to the HEX color of the icon shown in [simpleicons.org website](https://simpleicons.org). `[DARK_MODE_COLOR]` is used for dark mode. The [CSS prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) will be used when a value is specified. For example:

```html
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/gray&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/hotpink&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/0cf&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/0cf9&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/00ccff&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/00ccff99&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/orange/pink&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/_/eee&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons/eee/_&quot; /&gt;
```

You can use a `viewbox=auto` parameter to get an auto-sized viewbox. This is useful if you want all icons rendered with consistent size:

```html
&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/github?viewbox=auto&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/simpleicons?viewbox=auto&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/awesomelists?viewbox=auto&quot; /&gt;
```

### Node Usage &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/nodedotjs/000/fff&quot; alt=&quot;Node&quot; align=left width=24&gt;

The icons are also available through our npm package. To install, simply run:

```shell
npm install simple-icons
```

All icons are imported from a single file, where `[ICON SLUG]` is replaced by a capitalized [slug]. We highly recommend using a bundler that can tree shake such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to remove the unused icon code:

```javascript
// Import a specific icon by its slug as:
// import { si[ICON SLUG] } from &#039;simple-icons&#039;

// For example:
// use import/esm to allow tree shaking
import {siSimpleicons} from &#039;simple-icons&#039;;
// or with require/cjs
const {siSimpleicons} = require(&#039;simple-icons&#039;);
```

It will return an icon object:

```javascript
console.log(siSimpleicons);

/*
{
    title: &#039;Simple Icons&#039;,
    slug: &#039;simpleicons&#039;,
    hex: &#039;111111&#039;,
    source: &#039;https://simpleicons.org/&#039;,
    svg: &#039;&lt;svg role=&quot;img&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;...&lt;/svg&gt;&#039;,
    path: &#039;M12 12v-1.5c-2.484 ...&#039;,
    guidelines: &#039;https://simpleicons.org/styleguide&#039;,
    license: {
        type: &#039;...&#039;,
        url: &#039;https://example.com/&#039;
    }
}

NOTE: the `guidelines` entry will be `undefined` if we do not yet have guidelines for the icon.
NOTE: the `license` entry will be `undefined` if we do not yet have license data for the icon.
*/
```

If you need to iterate over all icons, use:

```javascript
import * as icons from &#039;simple-icons&#039;;
```

#### TypeScript Usage &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/typescript/000/fff&quot; alt=&quot;TypeScript&quot; align=left width=19 height=19&gt;

Type definitions are bundled with the package.

```typescript
import type {SimpleIcon} from &#039;simple-icons&#039;;
```

### PHP Usage &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.simpleicons.org/php/000/fff&quot; alt=&quot;Php&quot; align=left width=24 height=24&gt;

The icons are also available through [our Packagist package](https://packagist.org/packages/simple-icons/simple-icons). To install, simply run:

```shell
composer require simple-icons/simple-icons
```

The package can then be used as follows, where `[ICON SLUG]` is replaced by a [slug]:

```php
&lt;?php
// Import a specific icon by its slug as:
echo file_get_contents(&#039;path/to/package/icons/[ICON SLUG].svg&#039;);

// For example:
echo file_get_contents(&#039;path/to/package/icons/simpleicons.svg&#039;);

// &lt;svg role=&quot;img&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;...&lt;/svg&gt;
?&gt;
```

uBlock Origin (uBO) is a CPU and memory-efficient [wide-spectrum content blocker][Blocking] for Chromium and Firefox. It blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, annoying anti-blockers, malware sites, etc., by default using [EasyList][EasyList], [EasyPrivacy][EasyPrivacy], [Peter Lowe&#039;s Blocklist][Peter Lowe&#039;s Blocklist], [Online Malicious URL Blocklist][Malicious Blocklist], and uBO [filter lists][uBO Filters]. There are many other lists available to block even more. Hosts files are also supported. uBO uses the EasyList filter syntax and [extends][Extended Syntax] the syntax to work with custom rules and filters.

You may easily unselect any preselected filter lists if you think uBO blocks too much. For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only EasyList, ABP filters, and Acceptable Ads enabled by default.

It is important to note that using a blocker is **NOT** [theft]. Do not fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of `blocking = theft` is the criminalization of the inalienable right to privacy.

Ads, &quot;unintrusive&quot; or not, are just the visible portion of the privacy-invading means entering your browser when you visit most sites. **uBO&#039;s primary goal is to help users neutralize these privacy-invading methods** in a way that welcomes those users who do not wish to use more technical means.

[![Greasy Fork Downloads](https://img.shields.io/greasyfork/dt/446342-telegram-media-downloader)](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/446342-telegram-media-downloader)

&lt;/div&gt;

## Overview
This user script unlocks and enables download of images, GIFs, audios, and videos in Telegram webapps from chats, stories, and even private channels where downloading is disabled or restricted.

(Note: some features are only available for specific Telegram webapp version. e.g. Audio message download is only available for the K webapp version.)

### What are user scripts?
User scripts put you in control of your  browsing experience. Once installed, they automatically make the sites you visit better by adding features, making them easier to use, or taking out the annoying bits. The user scripts on Greasy Fork were written by other users and posted to share with the world. They&#039;re free to install and easy to use.

## Installation
### Greasy Fork
1. install a user script manager

    To use user scripts you need to first install a user script manager. Which user script manager you can use depends on which browser you use.

    - Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violent-monkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)

## How to Use
This script only works on Telegram Webapp.

For channels and chats that allow saving content, this script will have no effect. Please just use the official download button provided by the telegram webapp instead.

For channels and chats that disable downloading and restrict saving content, this script will add the download button back for images, GIFs and videos.

For videos, a progress bar will show on the bottom-right corder after you started downloading. For images and audios, there won&#039;t be a progress bar.

### Supported Webapp Versions
There are 2 different versions of telegram webapps:
- https://webk.telegram.org / https://web.telegram.org/k/ (**Recommended**)
- https://webz.telegram.org / https://web.telegram.org/a/

This script should work on both versions of webapp, but some features are only available in the /k/ version (such as voice message downloads). If certain features are not working, switching to the /k/ version is recommended.

### Check Downloading Progress
A progress bar will show on the bottom-right of the screen for videos. You can also check [DevTools console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) for logs.
