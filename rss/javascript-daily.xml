## Mission

**The world is rushing to build AI systems. It is not engineering them.**

That gap is what we mean by AI engineering.

**AI engineering is the discipline of building efficient, reliable, safe, and robust intelligent systems that operate in the real world, not just models in isolation.**

**Our mission:** Establish AI engineering as a foundational discipline, alongside software engineering and computer engineering, by teaching how to design, build, and evaluate end to end intelligent systems. The long term impact of AI will be shaped by engineers who can turn ideas into working, dependable systems.

---

## What’s in this repo

This repository is the open learning stack for AI systems engineering.

It includes the textbook source, TinyTorch, hardware kits, and upcoming co-labs that connect principles to runnable code and real devices.

## What Makes This Different

This is a living textbook. We keep it updated as the field grows, with community input along the way.

AI may feel like it is moving at lightning speed, but the engineering building blocks that make it work do not change as quickly as the headlines. This project is built around those stable foundations.

Think of it like LEGO. New sets arrive all the time, but the bricks themselves stay the same. Once you learn how the bricks fit together, you can build anything. Here, those &quot;AI bricks&quot; are the solid systems principles that make AI work.

Whether you are reading a chapter, running a lab, or sharing feedback, you are helping make these ideas more accessible to the next learner.

### Research to Teaching Loop

We use the same loop for research and teaching: define the system problem, build a reference implementation, benchmark it, then turn it into curriculum and tooling so others can reproduce and extend it.

| Loop Step | Research Artifacts | Teaching Artifacts |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Measure** | Benchmarks, suites, metrics | Benchmarking chapter, assignments |
| **Build** | Reference systems, compilers, runtimes | TinyTorch modules, co-labs |
| **Deploy** | Hardware targets, constraints, reliability | Hardware labs, kits |

## Support This Work

We are working toward **1 million learners by 2030** so that AI engineering becomes a shared, teachable discipline, not a collection of isolated practices. Every star, share, and contribution helps move this effort forward.

### Why GitHub Stars Matter

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

*What gets measured gets improved.*

Each star is a learner, educator, or supporter who believes AI systems should be engineered with rigor and real world constraints in mind.

[![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/harvard-edge/cs249r_book?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;color=gold)](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/stargazers)

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;Date)

1 learner → 10 learners → 100 learners → 1,000 learners → **10,000 learners** → 100,000 learners → **1M learners**

&lt;/div&gt;

Stars are not the goal. They are a signal.

A visible, growing community makes it easier for universities, foundations, and industry partners to adopt this material, donate hardware, and fund workshops. That momentum lowers the barrier for the next institution, the next classroom, and the next cohort of learners.

Support raised through this signal flows into [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook) and funds concrete outcomes such as TinyML4D workshops, hardware kits for underserved classrooms, and the infrastructure required to keep this resource free and open.

One click can unlock the next classroom, the next contributor, and the next generation of AI engineers.

### Fund the Mission

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

All contributions go to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook), a transparent fund that supports educational outreach.

## Why I Built This

I&#039;m a solo developer. I don&#039;t write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you&#039;re building. I&#039;m not a 50-person software company. I don&#039;t want to play enterprise theater. I&#039;m just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work *and* verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That&#039;s what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.

— **TÂCHES**

---

Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It&#039;s the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.

---

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they&#039;re running a 50-person engineering org.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

The installer prompts you to choose:
1. **Runtime** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, or all
2. **Location** — Global (all projects) or local (current project only)

Verify with `/gsd:help` inside your chosen runtime.

### Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# Claude Code
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --global   # Install to ~/.claude/
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local    # Install to ./.claude/

# OpenCode (open source, free models)
npx get-shit-done-cc --opencode --global # Install to ~/.config/opencode/

# Gemini CLI
npx get-shit-done-cc --gemini --global   # Install to ~/.gemini/

# All runtimes
npx get-shit-done-cc --all --global      # Install to all directories
```

Use `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the location prompt.
Use `--claude`, `--opencode`, `--gemini`, or `--all` to skip the runtime prompt.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Clone the repository and run the installer locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done.git
cd get-shit-done
node bin/install.js --claude --local
```

Installs to `./.claude/` for testing modifications before contributing.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Recommended: Skip Permissions Mode

GSD is designed for frictionless automation. Run Claude Code with:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; This is how GSD is intended to be used — stopping to approve `date` and `git commit` 50 times defeats the purpose.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative: Granular Permissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

If you prefer not to use that flag, add this to your project&#039;s `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allow&quot;: [
      &quot;Bash(date:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(echo:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(cat:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(ls:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(mkdir:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(wc:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(head:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(tail:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(sort:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(grep:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(tr:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git add:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git commit:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git status:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git log:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git diff:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git tag:*)&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## How It Works

&gt; **Already have code?** Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first. It spawns parallel agents to analyze your stack, architecture, conventions, and concerns. Then `/gsd:new-project` knows your codebase — questions focus on what you&#039;re adding, and planning automatically loads your patterns.

### 1. Initialize Project

```
/gsd:new-project
```

One command, one flow. The system:

1. **Questions** — Asks until it understands your idea completely (goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases)
2. **Research** — Spawns parallel agents to investigate the domain (optional but recommended)
3. **Requirements** — Extracts what&#039;s v1, v2, and out of scope
4. **Roadmap** — Creates phases mapped to requirements

You approve the roadmap. Now you&#039;re ready to build.

**Creates:** `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, `.planning/research/`

---

### 2. Discuss Phase

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 1
```

**This is where you shape the implementation.**

Your roadmap has a sentence or two per phase. That&#039;s not enough context to build something the way *you* imagine it. This step captures your preferences before anything gets researched or planned.

The system analyzes the phase and identifies gray areas based on what&#039;s being built:

- **Visual features** → Layout, density, interactions, empty states
- **APIs/CLIs** → Response format, flags, error handling, verbosity
- **Content systems** → Structure, tone, depth, flow
- **Organization tasks** → Grouping criteria, naming, duplicates, exceptions

For each area you select, it asks until you&#039;re satisfied. The output — `CONTEXT.md` — feeds directly into the next two steps:

1. **Researcher reads it** — Knows what patterns to investigate (&quot;user wants card layout&quot; → research card component libraries)
2. **Planner reads it** — Knows what decisions are locked (&quot;infinite scroll decided&quot; → plan includes scroll handling)

The deeper you go here, the more the system builds what you actually want. Skip it and you get reasonable defaults. Use it and you get *your* vision.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md`

---

### 3. Plan Phase

```
/gsd:plan-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Researches** — Investigates how to implement this phase, guided by your CONTEXT.md decisions
2. **Plans** — Creates 2-3 atomic task plans with XML structure
3. **Verifies** — Checks plans against requirements, loops until they pass

Each plan is small enough to execute in a fresh context window. No degradation, no &quot;I&#039;ll be more concise now.&quot;

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-RESEARCH.md`, `{phase_num}-{N}-PLAN.md`

---

### 4. Execute Phase

```
/gsd:execute-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Runs plans in waves** — Parallel where possible, sequential when dependent
2. **Fresh context per plan** — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage
3. **Commits per task** — Every task gets its own atomic commit
4. **Verifies against goals** — Checks the codebase delivers what the phase promised

Walk away, come back to completed work with clean git history.

**How Wave Execution Works:**

Plans are grouped into &quot;waves&quot; based on dependencies. Within each wave, plans run in parallel. Waves run sequentially.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE EXECUTION                                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                      │
│  WAVE 1 (parallel)          WAVE 2 (parallel)          WAVE 3       │
│  ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ │
│  │ Plan 01 │ │ Plan 02 │ →  │ Plan 03 │ │ Plan 04 │ →  │ Plan 05 │ │
│  │         │ │         │    │         │ │         │    │         │ │
│  │ User    │ │ Product │    │ Orders  │ │ Cart    │    │ Checkout│ │
│  │ Model   │ │ Model   │    │ API     │ │ API     │    │ UI      │ │
│  └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ │
│       │           │              ↑           ↑              ↑       │
│       └───────────┴──────────────┴───────────┘              │       │
│              Dependencies: Plan 03 needs Plan 01            │       │
│                          Plan 04 needs Plan 02              │       │
│                          Plan 05 needs Plans 03 + 04        │       │
│                                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why waves matter:**
- Independent plans → Same wave → Run in parallel
- Dependent plans → Later wave → Wait for dependencies
- File conflicts → Sequential plans or same plan

This is why &quot;vertical slices&quot; (Plan 01: User feature end-to-end) parallelize better than &quot;horizontal layers&quot; (Plan 01: All models, Plan 02: All APIs).

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-{N}-SUMMARY.md`, `{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md`

---

### 5. Verify Work

```
/gsd:verify-work 1
```

**This is where you confirm it actually works.**

Automated verification checks that code exists and tests pass. But does the feature *work* the way you expected? This is your chance to use it.

The system:

1. **Extracts testable deliverables** — What you should be able to do now
2. **Walks you through one at a time** — &quot;Can you log in with email?&quot; Yes/no, or describe what&#039;s wrong
3. **Diagnoses failures automatically** — Spawns debug agents to find root causes
4. **Creates verified fix plans** — Ready for immediate re-execution

If everything passes, you move on. If something&#039;s broken, you don&#039;t manually debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again with the fix plans it created.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-UAT.md`, fix plans if issues found

---

### 6. Repeat → Complete → Next Milestone

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 2
/gsd:plan-phase 2
/gsd:execute-phase 2
/gsd:verify-work 2
...
/gsd:complete-milestone
/gsd:new-milestone
```

Loop **discuss → plan → execute → verify** until milestone complete.

Each phase gets your input (discuss), proper research (plan), clean execution (execute), and human verification (verify). Context stays fresh. Quality stays high.

When all phases are done, `/gsd:complete-milestone` archives the milestone and tags the release.

Then `/gsd:new-milestone` starts the next version — same flow as `new-project` but for your existing codebase. You describe what you want to build next, the system researches the domain, you scope requirements, and it creates a fresh roadmap. Each milestone is a clean cycle: define → build → ship.

---

### Quick Mode

```
/gsd:quick
```

**For ad-hoc tasks that don&#039;t need full planning.**

Quick mode gives you GSD guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) with a faster path:

- **Same agents** — Planner + executor, same quality
- **Skips optional steps** — No research, no plan checker, no verifier
- **Separate tracking** — Lives in `.planning/quick/`, not phases

Use for: bug fixes, small features, config changes, one-off tasks.

```
/gsd:quick
&gt; What do you want to do? &quot;Add dark mode toggle to settings&quot;
```

**Creates:** `.planning/quick/001-add-dark-mode-toggle/PLAN.md`, `SUMMARY.md`

---

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

Claude Code is incredibly powerful *if* you give it the context it needs. Most people don&#039;t.

GSD handles it for you:

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded |
| `research/` | Ecosystem knowledge (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Scoped v1/v2 requirements with phase traceability |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you&#039;re going, what&#039;s done |
| `STATE.md` | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |
| `PLAN.md` | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps |
| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history |
| `todos/` | Captured ideas and tasks for later work |

Size limits based on where Claude&#039;s quality degrades. Stay under, get consistent excellence.

### XML Prompt Formatting

Every plan is structured XML optimized for Claude:

```xml
&lt;task type=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Create login endpoint&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;files&gt;src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts&lt;/files&gt;
  &lt;action&gt;
    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).
    Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  &lt;/action&gt;
  &lt;verify&gt;curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie&lt;/verify&gt;
  &lt;done&gt;Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401&lt;/done&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;
```

Precise instructions. No guessing. Verification built in.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Every stage uses the same pattern: a thin orchestrator spawns specialized agents, collects results, and routes to the next step.

| Stage | Orchestrator does | Agents do |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Research | Coordinates, presents findings | 4 parallel researchers investigate stack, features, architecture, pitfalls |
| Planning | Validates, manages iteration | Planner creates plans, checker verifies, loop until pass |
| Execution | Groups into waves, tracks progress | Executors implement in parallel, each with fresh 200k context |
| Verification | Presents results, routes next | Verifier checks codebase against goals, debuggers diagnose failures |

The orchestrator never does heavy lifting. It spawns agents, waits, integrates results.

**The result:** You can run an entire phase — deep research, multiple plans created and verified, thousands of lines of code written across parallel executors, automated verification against goals — and your main context window stays at 30-40%. The work happens in fresh subagent contexts. Your session stays fast and responsive.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

```bash
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing
lmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **Benefits:** Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task independently revertable. Clear history for Claude in future sessions. Better observability in AI-automated workflow.

Every commit is surgical, traceable, and meaningful.

### Modular by Design

- Add phases to current milestone
- Insert urgent work between phases
- Complete milestones and start fresh
- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything

You&#039;re never locked in. The system adapts.

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

- ESLint uses [Espree](https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/espree) for JavaScript parsing.
- ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
- ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`^20.19.0`, `^22.13.0`, or `&gt;=24`) built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)

You can install and configure ESLint using this command:

```shell
npm init @eslint/config@latest
```

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:

```shell
npx eslint yourfile.js
```

### pnpm Installation

To use ESLint with pnpm, we recommend setting up a `.npmrc` file with at least the following settings:

```text
auto-install-peers=true
node-linker=hoisted
```

This ensures that pnpm installs dependencies in a way that is more compatible with npm and is less likely to produce errors.

## Configuration

You can configure rules in your `eslint.config.js` files as in this example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from &quot;eslint/config&quot;;

export default defineConfig([
	{
		files: [&quot;**/*.js&quot;, &quot;**/*.cjs&quot;, &quot;**/*.mjs&quot;],
		rules: {
			&quot;prefer-const&quot;: &quot;warn&quot;,
			&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
		},
	},
]);
```

The names `&quot;prefer-const&quot;` and `&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;` are the names of [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules) in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:

- `&quot;off&quot;` or `0` - turn the rule off
- `&quot;warn&quot;` or `1` - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn&#039;t affect exit code)
- `&quot;error&quot;` or `2` - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the [configuration docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)).

## Version Support

The ESLint team provides ongoing support for the current version and six months of limited support for the previous version. Limited support includes critical bug fixes, security issues, and compatibility issues only.

ESLint offers commercial support for both current and previous versions through our partners, [Tidelift][tidelift] and [HeroDevs][herodevs].

See [Version Support](https://eslint.org/version-support) for more details.

## Code of Conduct

ESLint adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://eslint.org/conduct).

## Filing Issues

Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you&#039;re reporting:

- [Bug Report](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/report-bugs)
- [Propose a New Rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-new-rule)
- [Proposing a Rule Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-rule-change)
- [Request a Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/request-change)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does ESLint support JSX?

Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)). Please note that supporting JSX syntax _is not_ the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn&#039;t recognize. We recommend using [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react) if you are using React and want React semantics.

### Does Prettier replace ESLint?

No, ESLint and Prettier have different jobs: ESLint is a linter (looking for problematic patterns) and Prettier is a code formatter. Using both tools is common, refer to [Prettier&#039;s documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install#eslint-and-other-linters) to learn how to configure them to work well with each other.

### What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?

ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5, and every year from 2015 up until the most recent stage 4 specification (the default). You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax and other settings (like global variables) through [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure).

### What about experimental features?

ESLint&#039;s parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.

In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use [@babel/eslint-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser) and [@babel/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-plugin) to use any option available in Babel.

Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the [TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/)), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our [contributing guidelines](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute). Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.

### Which Node.js versions does ESLint support?

ESLint updates the supported Node.js versions with each major release of ESLint. At that time, ESLint&#039;s supported Node.js versions are updated to be:

1. The most recent maintenance release of Node.js
1. The lowest minor version of the Node.js LTS release that includes the features the ESLint team wants to use.
1. The Node.js Current release

ESLint is also expected to work with Node.js versions released after the Node.js Current release.

Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#prerequisites) for the officially supported Node.js versions for a given ESLint release.

### Where to ask for help?

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions) or stop by our [Discord server](https://eslint.org/chat).

### Why doesn&#039;t ESLint lock dependency versions?

Lock files like `package-lock.json` are helpful for deployed applications. They ensure that dependencies are consistent between environments and across deployments.

Packages like `eslint` that get published to the npm registry do not include lock files. `npm install eslint` as a user will respect version constraints in ESLint&#039;s `package.json`. ESLint and its dependencies will be included in the user&#039;s lock file if one exists, but ESLint&#039;s own lock file would not be used.

We intentionally don&#039;t lock dependency versions so that we have the latest compatible dependency versions in development and CI that our users get when installing ESLint in a project.

The Twilio blog has a [deeper dive](https://www.twilio.com/blog/lockfiles-nodejs) to learn more.

## Releases

We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a [release issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arelease) for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.

## Security Policy

ESLint takes security seriously. We work hard to ensure that ESLint is safe for everyone and that security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly. Read the full [security policy](https://github.com/eslint/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Semantic Versioning Policy

ESLint follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it&#039;s not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we&#039;ve defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint:

- Patch release (intended to not break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer linting errors.
    - A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).
    - Improvements to documentation.
    - Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.
    - Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn&#039;t work for anyone).
- Minor release (might break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors.
    - A new rule is created.
    - A new option to an existing rule that does not result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - A new addition to an existing rule to support a newly-added language feature (within the last 12 months) that will result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing rule is deprecated.
    - A new CLI capability is created.
    - New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).
    - A new formatter is created.
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and will result in strictly fewer linting errors (e.g., rule removals).
- Major release (likely to break your lint build)
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and may result in new linting errors (e.g., rule additions, most rule option updates).
    - A new option to an existing rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing formatter is removed.
    - Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. The public API includes:
        - Rule schemas
        - Configuration schema
        - Command-line options
        - Node.js API
        - Rule, formatter, parser, plugin APIs

According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` e.g. `&quot;eslint&quot;: &quot;~3.1.0&quot;` to guarantee the results of your builds.

## ESM Dependencies

Since ESLint is a CommonJS package, there are restrictions on which ESM-only packages can be used as dependencies.

Packages that are controlled by the ESLint team and have no external dependencies can be safely loaded synchronously using [`require(esm)`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-ecmascript-modules-using-require) and therefore used in any contexts.

For external packages, we don&#039;t use `require(esm)` because a package could add a top-level `await` and thus break ESLint. We can use an external ESM-only package only in case it is needed only in asynchronous code, in which case it can be loaded using dynamic `import()`.

### AGPL Components (Pre-configured via CDN)

BentoPDF does **not** bundle AGPL-licensed processing libraries in its source code, but **pre-configures CDN URLs** so all features work out of the box with zero setup:

| Component              | License  | Features Enabled                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PyMuPDF**            | AGPL-3.0 | PDF to Text/Markdown/SVG/DOCX, Extract Images/Tables, EPUB/MOBI/XPS conversion, Compression, Deskew |
| **Ghostscript**        | AGPL-3.0 | PDF/A Conversion, Font to Outline                                                                   |
| **CoherentPDF (CPDF)** | AGPL-3.0 | Merge, Split by Bookmarks, Table of Contents, PDF to/from JSON, Attachments                         |

### Usage

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
import * as THREE from &#039;three&#039;;

const width = window.innerWidth, height = window.innerHeight;

// init

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, width / height, 0.01, 10 );
camera.position.z = 1;

const scene = new THREE.Scene();

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
renderer.setSize( width, height );
renderer.setAnimationLoop( animate );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

// animation

function animate( time ) {

	mesh.rotation.x = time / 2000;
	mesh.rotation.y = time / 1000;

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}
```

If everything goes well, you should see [this](https://jsfiddle.net/w43x5Lgh/).

### Cloning this repository

Cloning the repo with all its history results in a ~2 GB download. If you don&#039;t need the whole history you can use the `depth` parameter to significantly reduce download size.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git
```

## About

draw.io is a configurable diagramming and whiteboarding application, jointly owned and developed by draw.io Ltd (previously named JGraph) and draw.io AG. We also run a production deployment at https://app.diagrams.net.

## License

The source code in this repository is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

The icon sets, stencil libraries, and diagram templates are provided under the following terms:

&gt; The icon sets and stencil libraries included in this software, and any derivatives thereof (including conversions to other formats, traced reproductions, substantially similar visual representations, or AI-generated images created using these icons as reference or training input), may not be used as software assets in, distributed for use with, or incorporated into Atlassian products or products distributed through the Atlassian marketplace or plugin ecosystem, without explicit written permission.
&gt;
&gt; This restriction does not apply to end-user diagram output (such as exported images or documents) created using this software.

Some icons are originally defined by third-party copyright holders; we have verified that all original licenses permit use in this project. Additional third-party JavaScript libraries are included, all with licenses compatible with Apache 2.0 (no GPL or AGPL).

We make no copyright claim on diagrams you create with this software.

## Contributions

We do not accept pull requests. The project is developed entirely by the core team. The entire draw.io editor is human written by the core, full-time development team, no AI generation. 

## Scope

draw.io is a diagramming and whiteboarding application. It is not an SVG editor. SVG export is intended for embedding in web pages, not for editing in other tools.

Note that draw.io does not support real-time collaborative editing in this version, currently.

For issues or questions about the editor in any draw.io product, the issue tracker and discussions here are a good starting point.

## Running

Options for running draw.io:

- Fork this repository and [publish to GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) for a [fully functional editor](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) (without integrations)
- Use the [official Docker image](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio)
- Download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net)

Packaged .war files are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).

## Supported Browsers

Chrome 123+, Firefox 120+, Safari 17.5+, Opera 109+, Edge 123+, WebView Android 137+, Safari iOS 18.5+.

## Installing

### Package manager

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install axios
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add axios
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
$ pnpm add axios
```

Using bun:

```bash
$ bun add axios
```

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using `import` or `require` approach:

```js
import axios, { isCancel, AxiosError } from &quot;axios&quot;;
```

You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:

```js
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;

console.log(axios.isCancel(&quot;something&quot;));
```

If you use `require` for importing, **only the default export is available**:

```js
const axios = require(&quot;axios&quot;);

console.log(axios.isCancel(&quot;something&quot;));
```

For some bundlers and some ES6 linters you may need to do the following:

```js
import { default as axios } from &quot;axios&quot;;
```

For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:

```js
const axios = require(&quot;axios/dist/browser/axios.cjs&quot;); // browser commonJS bundle (ES2017)
// const axios = require(&#039;axios/dist/node/axios.cjs&#039;); // node commonJS bundle (ES2017)
```

### CDN

Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.13.2/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Using unpkg CDN:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/axios@1.13.2/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Example

```js
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;
//const axios = require(&#039;axios&#039;); // legacy way

try {
  const response = await axios.get(&quot;/user?ID=12345&quot;);
  console.log(response);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios
  .get(&quot;/user&quot;, {
    params: {
      ID: 12345,
    },
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .finally(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(&quot;/user?ID=12345&quot;);
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

&gt; **Note**: `async/await` is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
&gt; Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.

Performing a `POST` request

```js
const response = await axios.post(&quot;/user&quot;, {
  firstName: &quot;Fred&quot;,
  lastName: &quot;Flintstone&quot;,
});
console.log(response);
```

Performing multiple concurrent requests

```js
function getUserAccount() {
  return axios.get(&quot;/user/12345&quot;);
}

function getUserPermissions() {
  return axios.get(&quot;/user/12345/permissions&quot;);
}

Promise.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()]).then(function (results) {
  const acct = results[0];
  const perm = results[1];
});
```

## axios API

Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to `axios`.

##### axios(config)

```js
// Send a POST request
axios({
  method: &quot;post&quot;,
  url: &quot;/user/12345&quot;,
  data: {
    firstName: &quot;Fred&quot;,
    lastName: &quot;Flintstone&quot;,
  },
});
```

```js
// GET request for remote image in node.js
const response = await axios({
  method: &quot;get&quot;,
  url: &quot;https://bit.ly/2mTM3nY&quot;,
  responseType: &quot;stream&quot;,
});
response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(&quot;ada_lovelace.jpg&quot;));
```

##### axios(url[, config])

```js
// Send a GET request (default method)
axios(&quot;/user/12345&quot;);
```

### Request method aliases

For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.

##### axios.request(config)

##### axios.get(url[, config])

##### axios.delete(url[, config])

##### axios.head(url[, config])

##### axios.options(url[, config])

##### axios.post(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios.put(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios.patch(url[, data[, config]])

###### NOTE

When using the alias methods `url`, `method`, and `data` properties don&#039;t need to be specified in config.

### Concurrency (Deprecated)

Please use `Promise.all` to replace the below functions.

Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.

axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)

### Creating an instance

You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.

##### axios.create([config])

```js
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: &quot;https://some-domain.com/api/&quot;,
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: { &quot;X-Custom-Header&quot;: &quot;foobar&quot; },
});
```

### Instance methods

The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.

##### axios#request(config)

##### axios#get(url[, config])

##### axios#delete(url[, config])

##### axios#head(url[, config])

##### axios#options(url[, config])

##### axios#post(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#put(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#patch(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#getUri([config])

## Request Config

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the `url` is required. Requests will default to `GET` if `method` is not specified.

```js
{
  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: &#039;/user&#039;,

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: &#039;get&#039;, // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` u

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

Remember that each data has its own trade-offs. And you need to pay attention more to why you&#039;re choosing a certain data structure than to how to implement it.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

### Algorithms by Paradigm

An algorithmic paradigm is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class
of algorithms. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an
algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program.

* **Backtracking** - similarly to brute force, try to generate all possible solutions, but each time you generate the next solution, you test
if it satisfies all conditions and only then continue generating subsequent solutions. Otherwise, backtrack and go on a
different path to finding a solution. Normally the DFS traversal of state-space is being used.
  * `B` [Jump Game](src/algorithms/uncategorized/jump-game)

  * `A` [Combination Sum](src/algorithms/sets/combination-sum) - find all combinations that form specific sum
* **Branch &amp; Bound** - remember the lowest-cost solution found at each stage of the backtracking
search, and use the cost of the lowest-cost solution found so far as a lower bound on the cost of
a least-cost solution to the problem in order to discard partial solutions with costs larger than the
lowest-cost solution found so far. Normally, BFS traversal in combination with DFS traversal of state-space
tree is being used.

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Defillama Adapters

Follow [this guide](https://docs.llama.fi/submit-a-project) to create an adapter and submit a PR with it.

Also, don&#039;t hesitate to send a message on [our discord](https://discord.defillama.com/) if we&#039;re late to merge your PR.

&gt; If you would like to add a `volume` adapter please submit the PR [here](https://github.com/DefiLlama/adapters)
&gt; - If you would like to add a `liquidations` adapter, please refer to [this readme document](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/tree/main/liquidations) for details.

1. PLEASE PLEASE **enable &quot;Allow edits by maintainers&quot; while putting up the PR.**
2. Once your adapter has been merged, it takes time to show on the UI. No need to notify us on Discord.
3. TVL must be computed from blockchain data (reason: https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/discussions/432), if you have trouble with creating the adapter, please hop onto our discord, we are happy to assist you.
4. **For updating listing info** It is a different repo, you can find your listing in this file: https://github.com/DefiLlama/defillama-server/blob/master/defi/src/protocols/data2.ts, you can  edit it there and put up a PR
5. Do not edit/push `package-lock.json` file as part of your changes, we use lockfileVersion 2, and most use v1 and using that messes up our CI
6. No need to go to our discord and announce that you&#039;ve created a PR, we monitor all PRs and will review it asap

## Getting listed

Please send answers to questions there https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/blob/main/pull_request_template.md when creating a PR.

## Work in progress

This is a work in progress. DefiLlama aims to be transparent, accurate, and open source.

If you have any suggestions, want to contribute or want to chat, please join [our discord](https://discord.defillama.com/) and drop a message.

## Testing adapters
```bash
node test.js projects/pangolin/index.js
# Add a timestamp at the end to run the adapter at a historical timestamp
node test.js projects/aave/v3.js 1729080692
# or using YYYY-MM-DD
node test.js projects/aave/v3.js 2024-10-16
```

## Changing RPC providers
If you want to change RPC providers because you need archive node access or because the default ones don&#039;t work well enough you can do so by creating an `.env` file and filling it with the env variables to overwrite:
```
ETHEREUM_RPC=&quot;...&quot;
BSC_RPC=&quot;...&quot;
POLYGON_RPC=&quot;...&quot;
```

The name of each rpc is `{CHAIN-NAME}_RPC`, and the name we use for each chain can be found [here](https://unpkg.com/@defillama/sdk@latest/build/providers.json). If you run into issues with a chain make sure to update the sdk with `npm update @defillama/sdk`.

## Adapter rules
- Never add extra npm packages, if you need a chain-level package for your chain, ask us, and we&#039;ll consider it, but we can&#039;t accept any npm package that is project-specific

Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting `5t` will open 5 tabs in rapid
succession. `&lt;Esc&gt;` (or `&lt;c-[&gt;`) will clear any partial commands in the queue and will also exit
insert and find modes.

There are additional commands which aren&#039;t included in this README; refer to the help dialog (type
`?`) for a full list.

## Custom Key Mappings

You may remap or unmap any of the default key bindings in the &quot;Custom key mappings&quot; on the options
page.

Enter one of the following key mapping statements per line:

- `map key command`: Maps a key to a Vimium command. Overrides Chrome&#039;s default behavior for that
  key, if any.
- `unmap key`: Unmaps a key and restores Chrome&#039;s default behavior (if any).
- `unmapAll`: Unmaps all bindings. This is useful if you want to completely wipe Vimium&#039;s defaults
  and start from scratch with your own setup.

Examples:

- `map &lt;c-d&gt; scrollPageDown` maps ctrl+d to scrolling the page down. Chrome&#039;s default behavior of
  showing a bookmark dialog is suppressed.
- `map r reload hard` maps the r key to reloading the page, and also includes the &quot;hard&quot; option to
  hard-reload the page.
- `unmap &lt;c-d&gt;` removes any mapping for ctrl+d and restores Chrome&#039;s default behavior.
- `unmap r` removes any mapping for the r key.

See the [docs](https://vimium.github.io/commands/) for every Vimium command and its options.

You can add comments to key mappings by starting a line with `&quot;` or `#`.

The following special keys are available for mapping:

- `&lt;c-*&gt;`, `&lt;a-*&gt;`, `&lt;s-*&gt;`, `&lt;m-*&gt;` for ctrl, alt, shift, and meta (command on Mac) respectively
  with any key. Replace `*` with the key of choice.
- `&lt;left&gt;`, `&lt;right&gt;`, `&lt;up&gt;`, `&lt;down&gt;` for the arrow keys.
- `&lt;f1&gt;` through `&lt;f12&gt;` for the function keys.
- `&lt;space&gt;` for the space key.
- `&lt;tab&gt;`, `&lt;enter&gt;`, `&lt;delete&gt;`, `&lt;backspace&gt;`, `&lt;insert&gt;`, `&lt;home&gt;` and `&lt;end&gt;` for the
  corresponding non-printable keys.

Shifts are automatically detected so, for example, `&lt;c-&amp;&gt;` corresponds to ctrl+shift+7 on an English
keyboard.

## How to allow Vimium to work on new tab pages

- Vimium will work on new tab pages which are opened with Vimium&#039;s `createTab` command (mapped to
  `t` by default).
- To have Vimium work on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; new tab pages opened by the browser (e.g. via `cmd-t` or
  `ctrl-t` shortcuts), a companion
  [Vimium New Tab Page extension](https://github.com/philc/vimium-new-tab/) is required.
- Once that is installed, all new tabs will open a blank Vimium new tab page.

## Why does it exist? 🔓

Calibre, while a fantastic tool for its age, has several problems when containerised, including its reliance on a KasmVNC server instance for the UI, which is near impossible to use on mobile and is relatively resource-heavy if you&#039;re running a small, lower power server like I am.

For many, Calibre-Web has really swooped in to save the day, offering an alternative to a containerised Calibre instance that&#039;s resource-light and with a much more modern UI to boot.

However, when compared to full-fat Calibre, it unfortunately lacks a few core features leading many to run both services in parallel, each serving to fill in where the other lacks, resulting in an often clunky, imperfect solution.

## Goal of the Project 🎯

Calibre-Web Automated aims to be an all-in-one solution, combining the modern lightweight web UI from Calibre-Web with the robust, versatile feature set of Calibre, with a slew of extra features and automations thrown in on top.

## 🚨 Deploying on Network Shares (NFS/SMB) 🚨

- CWA now supports network-share deployments via `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true`
  - This disables SQLite WAL on `metadata.db` and `app.db` to prevent locking issues
  - Skips recursive ownership changes that often fail on NFS/SMB
  - Switches ingest/metadata watchers to a polling-based watcher for reliability
- Network shares are still slower than local disks, but are now fully supported with this mode enabled

### Network shares and SQLite WAL mode

- CWA optimizes SQLite concurrency by enabling Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) on local disks.
- Some network filesystems (NFS/SMB) do not fully support WAL or reliable file locking, which can cause intermittent &quot;database is locked&quot; errors or corruption risks.
- If you are deploying on a network share, set the following environment variable to disable WAL:

  - `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true`

This tells CWA to avoid enabling WAL on the Calibre `metadata.db` and the `app.db` settings database. It also disables recursive ownership changes (`chown`) performed by init/maintenance scripts to avoid permission issues on network filesystems. Default is `false` (WAL enabled) for better performance on local disks.

#### File watching on network shares

- By default, CWA uses Linux `inotify` (via `inotifywait`) to detect new files in the ingest folder with minimal latency and overhead.
- On network shares (NFS/SMB), filesystem events can be unreliable or unavailable. When `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true` is set, CWA switches the ingest and metadata watcher services to a polling-based watcher that periodically scans for changes. This improves reliability on NAS/network mounts at the cost of slightly higher I/O and up to a few seconds of latency.
- On Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS), the container runs on a LinuxKit/WSL2 VM and host-mounted paths may not propagate `inotify` events reliably. CWA auto-detects Docker Desktop at startup and prefers the same polling watcher for reliability.
- Advanced: You can also force polling regardless of share mode by setting `CWA_WATCH_MODE=poll`.

### Running behind multiple proxies (Cloudflare Tunnel, reverse proxy)

- CWA uses Werkzeug&#039;s ProxyFix middleware to properly handle `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and other proxy headers.
- By default, it trusts **1 proxy** in the chain. If you have multiple proxies (e.g., Cloudflare Tunnel → nginx → CWA), set:

  - `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=2` (or the total number of proxies in your chain)

- **Why this matters**: Session protection validates requests based on the client&#039;s IP address. If ProxyFix doesn&#039;t trust enough proxies, it may see different IPs between requests, causing &quot;Session protection triggered&quot; warnings and forcing re-login.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you see frequent session protection warnings in logs, check your proxy chain depth and adjust this variable accordingly.

#### **Automatic Ingest Service** ✨
- CWA currently supports automatic ingest of 27 different popular ebook formats
- Users can configure the services behavior to ignore and/or have certain formats automatically converted to other formats in the Admin Panel

#### **Automatic Conversion Service** 🔃
- On by default though can be toggled off in the CWA Settings page, with EPUB as the default target format
  - _Available target formats include:_ **EPUB**, **MOBI**, **AZW3**, **KEPUB** &amp; **PDF**
- Upon detecting new files in the Ingest Directory, if any of the files are in formats the user has configured CWA to auto-convert to the current target format,
- The following **28 file types are currently supported:**
  - _.acsm, .azw, .azw3, .azw4, .mobi, .cbz, .cbr, .cb7, .cbc, .chm, .djvu, .docx, .epub, .fb2, .fbz, .html, .htmlz, .lit, .lrf, .odt, .pdf, .prc, .pdb, .pml, .rb, .rtf, .snb, .tcr, .txtz_
  - _Note: .acsm requires an additional Calibre plugin_

#### **Automatic Enforcement of Changes made to Covers &amp; Metadata through the Calibre-Web UI!** 👀📔
- In stock Calibre-Web, any changes made to a book&#039;s **Cover and/or Metadata** are only applied to how the book appears in the Calibre-Web UI, changing nothing in the ebook&#039;s files like you would expect
- This results in a frustrating situation for many CW users who utilise CW&#039;s Send-To-Kindle function, and are disappointed to find that the High-Quality Covers they picked out and carefully chosen Metadata they sourced are completely absent on all their other devices! UGH!
- CWA&#039;s **Automatic Cover &amp; Metadata Enforcement Feature** makes it so that **WHATEVER** you changes you make to **YOUR** books, **_are made to the books themselves_**, as well as in the Web UI, **making what you see, what you get.**

#### **Automated Back Up Service** 🔒
- Worried what will happen if something goes wrong during one of CWA&#039;s automated functions? Don&#039;t be!
- By default, the originals all files processed by CWA are stored in `/config/processed_books` though this can be toggled in the CWA Settings panel

#### **Smart Duplicate Detection System &amp; Management** 🔍
- Hybrid SQL + fuzzy matching detects duplicates missed by traditional scans
- Post-ingest checks and scheduled incremental scans
- One-click merge, batch operations, and optional auto-resolution

![](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/blob/main/README_images/new-send-to-ereader-modal.png?raw=true)

#### **Automatic EPUB Fixer Service** 📧✅
- Ever had it where you&#039;re super excited to start reading your next book but for some reason, Amazon&#039;s Send-to-Kindle service just keeps rejecting it? Well no more!

- Originally developed by [innocenat](https://github.com/innocenat/kindle-epub-fix), this tool corrects the following potential issues for every EPUB processed by CWA:
  - Fixes UTF-8 encoding problem by adding UTF-8 declaration if no encoding is specified
  - Fixes hyperlink problem (result in Amazon rejecting the EPUB) when NCX table of content link to `&lt;body&gt;` with ID hash.
  - Detect invalid and/or missing language tag in metadata, and prompt user to select new language.
  - Remove stray `&lt;img&gt;` tags with no source field.
  - Resolves several EPUB compatibility issues, such as UTF-8 encoding, hyperlink problems, invalid/missing language tags, and stray image tags.
  - Repairs malformed language tags, XML declarations, and UTF-8 headers
  - Cleans invalid NCX links, broken CSS/fonts, and stray image tags
- This **ensures maximum comparability** for each EPUB file with the Amazon **Send-to-Kindle** service and for those who don&#039;t use Amazon devices, has the side benefit of cleaning up your lower quality files!
- Enabled by default, with per-run backups in `/config/processed_books`
- Bulk processing of whole library with progress tracking available in the Admin Panel

![CWA EPUB Fixer Service Web UI](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/blob/main/README_images/CWA-new-process-ui.gif?raw=true)

#### **Simple to use Multi-Format Conversion Service** 🌌
- This utility gives the user the option to either keep a copy of the original of all converted files in `/config/processed_books` or to trust the process and have CWA simply convert and replace those files (not recommended)
- Full usage details can be found [here](#the-convert-library-tool)

#### **Additional Metadata Providers** 🗃️
- Users can now make use of [isbndb.com](https://isbndb.com/)&#039;s huge database when fetching metadata for the books in their library!
- Access is being provided via [ibdb.dev](https://ibdb.dev/) thanks to a generous donation to the community by [@chad3814](https://www.github.com/chad3814)

An inference library for [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M). You can [`pip install kokoro`](https://pypi.org/project/kokoro/).

&gt; **Kokoro** is an open-weight TTS model with 82 million parameters. Despite its lightweight architecture, it delivers comparable quality to larger models while being significantly faster and more cost-efficient. With Apache-licensed weights, Kokoro can be deployed anywhere from production environments to personal projects.

### Usage
You can run this basic cell on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). [Listen to samples](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/blob/main/SAMPLES.md).
```py
!pip install -q kokoro&gt;=0.9.4 soundfile
!apt-get -qq -y install espeak-ng &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
from kokoro import KPipeline
from IPython.display import display, Audio
import soundfile as sf
import torch
pipeline = KPipeline(lang_code=&#039;a&#039;)

It was a Sprawl voice and a Sprawl joke. The Chatsubo was a bar for professional expatriates; you could drink there for a week and never hear two words in Japanese.

These were to have an enormous impact, not only because they were associated with Constantine, but also because, as in so many other areas, the decisions taken by Constantine (or in his name) were to have great significance for centuries to come. One of the main issues was the shape that Christian churches were to take, since there was not, apparently, a tradition of monumental church buildings when Constantine decided to help the Christian church build a series of truly spectacular structures. The main form that these churches took was that of the basilica, a multipurpose rectangular structure, based ultimately on the earlier Greek stoa, which could be found in most of the great cities of the empire. Christianity, unlike classical polytheism, needed a large interior space for the celebration of its religious services, and the basilica aptly filled that need. We naturally do not know the degree to which the emperor was involved in the design of new churches, but it is tempting to connect this with the secular basilica that Constantine completed in the Roman forum (the so-called Basilica of Maxentius) and the one he probably built in Trier, in connection with his residence in the city at a time when he was still caesar.

## Comece Aqui (10 Min)

Se é sua primeira vez no AIOS, siga este caminho linear:

1. Instale em um projeto novo ou existente:
```bash
# novo projeto
npx aios-core init meu-projeto

# projeto existente
cd seu-projeto
npx aios-core install
```
2. Escolha sua IDE/CLI e o caminho de ativação:
- Claude Code: `/agent-name`
- Gemini CLI: `/aios-menu` → `/aios-&lt;agent&gt;`
- Codex CLI: `/skills` → `aios-&lt;agent-id&gt;`
- Cursor/Copilot/AntiGravity: siga os limites e workarounds em `docs/ide-integration.md`
3. Ative 1 agente e confirme o greeting.
4. Rode 1 comando inicial (`*help` ou equivalente) para validar first-value.

Definição de first-value (binária): ativação de agente + greeting válido + comando inicial com output útil em &lt;= 10 minutos.


## Compatibilidade de Hooks por IDE (Realidade AIOS 4.2)

Muitos recursos avançados do AIOS dependem de eventos de ciclo de vida (hooks). A tabela abaixo mostra a paridade real entre IDEs/plataformas:

| IDE/CLI | Paridade de Hooks vs Claude | Impacto Prático |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Completa (referência) | Automação máxima de contexto, guardrails e auditoria |
| Gemini CLI | Alta (eventos nativos) | Cobertura forte de automações pre/post tool e sessão |
| Codex CLI | Parcial/limitada | Parte das automações depende de `AGENTS.md`, `/skills`, MCP e fluxo operacional |
| Cursor | Sem lifecycle hooks equivalentes | Menor automação de pre/post tool; foco em regras, MCP e fluxo do agente |
| GitHub Copilot | Sem lifecycle hooks equivalentes | Menor automação de sessão/tooling; foco em instruções de repositório + MCP no VS Code |
| AntiGravity | Workflow-based (não hook-based) | Integração por workflows, não por eventos de hook equivalentes ao Claude |

Impactos e mitigação detalhados: `docs/ide-integration.md`.

## Visão Geral

### Premissa Arquitetural: CLI First

O Synkra AIOS segue uma hierarquia clara de prioridades:

```
CLI First → Observability Second → UI Third
```

| Camada            | Prioridade | Foco                                                                          | Exemplos                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **CLI**           | Máxima     | Onde a inteligência vive. Toda execução, decisões e automação acontecem aqui. | Agentes (`@dev`, `@qa`), workflows, comandos |
| **Observability** | Secundária | Observar e monitorar o que acontece no CLI em tempo real.                     | Dashboard SSE, logs, métricas, timeline      |
| **UI**            | Terciária  | Gestão pontual e visualizações quando necessário.                             | Kanban, settings, story management           |

**Princípios derivados:**

- A CLI é a fonte da verdade - dashboards apenas observam
- Funcionalidades novas devem funcionar 100% via CLI antes de ter UI
- A UI nunca deve ser requisito para operação do sistema
- Observabilidade serve para entender o que o CLI está fazendo, não para controlá-lo

**As Duas Inovações Chave do Synkra AIOS:**

**1. Planejamento Agêntico:** Agentes dedicados (analyst, pm, architect) colaboram com você para criar documentos de PRD e Arquitetura detalhados e consistentes. Através de engenharia avançada de prompts e refinamento com human-in-the-loop, estes agentes de planejamento produzem especificações abrangentes que vão muito além da geração genérica de tarefas de IA.

**2. Desenvolvimento Contextualizado por Engenharia:** O agente sm (Scrum Master) então transforma estes planos detalhados em histórias de desenvolvimento hiperdetalhadas que contêm tudo que o agente dev precisa - contexto completo, detalhes de implementação e orientação arquitetural incorporada diretamente nos arquivos de histórias.

Esta abordagem de duas fases elimina tanto a **inconsistência de planejamento** quanto a **perda de contexto** - os maiores problemas no desenvolvimento assistido por IA. Seu agente dev abre um arquivo de história com compreensão completa do que construir, como construir e por quê.

**📖 [Veja o fluxo de trabalho completo no Guia do Usuário](docs/guides/user-guide.md)** - Fase de planejamento, ciclo de desenvolvimento e todos os papéis dos agentes

## Pré-requisitos

- Node.js &gt;=18.0.0 (v20+ recomendado)
- npm &gt;=9.0.0
- GitHub CLI (opcional, necessário para colaboração em equipe)

&gt; **Problemas de instalação?** Consulte o [Guia de Troubleshooting](docs/guides/installation-troubleshooting.md)

**Guias específicos por plataforma:**

- 📖 [Guia de Instalação para macOS](docs/installation/macos.md)
- 📖 [Guia de Instalação para Windows](docs/installation/windows.md)
- 📖 [Guia de Instalação para Linux](docs/installation/linux.md)

**Documentação multilíngue disponível:** [Português](docs/pt/installation/) | [Español](docs/es/installation/)

## Navegação Rápida

### Entendendo o Fluxo de Trabalho AIOS

**Antes de mergulhar, revise estes diagramas críticos de fluxo de trabalho que explicam como o AIOS funciona:**

1. **[Fluxo de Planejamento (Interface Web)](docs/guides/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui)** - Como criar documentos de PRD e Arquitetura
2. **[Ciclo Principal de Desenvolvimento (IDE)](docs/guides/user-guide.md#the-core-development-cycle-ide)** - Como os agentes sm, dev e qa colaboram através de arquivos de histórias

&gt; ⚠️ **Estes diagramas explicam 90% da confusão sobre o fluxo Synkra AIOS Agentic Agile** - Entender a criação de PRD+Arquitetura e o fluxo de trabalho sm/dev/qa e como os agentes passam notas através de arquivos de histórias é essencial - e também explica por que isto NÃO é taskmaster ou apenas um simples executor de tarefas!

### Requirements

You should be running a currently supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run **`npm`**.  For a list of which versions of Node.js are currently supported, please see the [Node.js releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) page.

### Installation

**`npm`** comes bundled with [**`node`**](https://nodejs.org/), &amp; most third-party distributions, by default. Officially supported downloads/distributions can be found at: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### Direct Download

You can download &amp; install **`npm`** directly from [**npmjs**.com](https://npmjs.com/) using our custom `install.sh` script:

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### Node Version Managers

If you&#039;re looking to manage multiple versions of **`Node.js`** &amp;/or **`npm`**, consider using a [node version manager](https://github.com/search?q=node+version+manager+archived%3Afalse&amp;type=repositories&amp;ref=advsearch)

### Usage

```bash
npm &lt;command&gt;
```

* You can configure `npm` to use any other compatible registry you prefer. You can read more about [configuring third-party registries](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/registry)

### FAQ on Branding

#### Is it &quot;npm&quot; or &quot;NPM&quot; or &quot;Npm&quot;?

**`npm`** should never be capitalized unless it is being displayed in a location that is customarily all-capitals (ex. titles on `man` pages).

#### Is &quot;npm&quot; an acronym for &quot;Node Package Manager&quot;?

Contrary to popular belief, **`npm`** **is not** an acronym for &quot;Node Package Manager.&quot; It is a recursive backronymic abbreviation for **&quot;npm is not an acronym&quot;** (if the project were named &quot;ninaa,&quot; then it would be an acronym). The precursor to **`npm`** was actually a bash utility named **&quot;pm&quot;**, which was the shortform name of **&quot;pkgmakeinst&quot;** - a bash function that installed various things on various platforms. If **`npm`** were ever considered an acronym, it would be as &quot;node pm&quot; or, potentially, &quot;new pm&quot;.
