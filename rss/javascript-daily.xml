The internet&#039;s most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from
scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.

### Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?

Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don&#039;t plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.

Documentation is still available but it&#039;s moved to
[https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0) and
[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

# Style Dictionary

&gt; _Style once, use everywhere._

A Style Dictionary uses design tokens to define styles once and use those styles on any platform or language. It provides a single place to create and edit your styles, and exports these tokens to all the places you need - iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML, sketch files, style documentation, etc. It is available as a CLI through npm, but can also be used like any normal node module if you want to extend its functionality.

When you are managing user experiences, it can be quite challenging to keep styles consistent and synchronized across multiple development platforms and devices. At the same time, designers, developers, PMs and others must be able to have consistent and up-to-date style documentation to enable effective work and communication. Even then, mistakes inevitably happen and the design may not be implemented accurately. Style Dictionary solves this by automatically generating style definitions across all platforms from a single source - removing roadblocks, errors, and inefficiencies across your workflow.

For detailed usage head to https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary

## Watch the Demo on YouTube

[![Watch the video](/docs/src/assets/fake_player.png)](http://youtu.be/1HREvonfqhY)

## Experiment in the playground

Try the browser-based Style Dictionary playground: [https://www.style-dictionary-play.dev/](https://www.style-dictionary-play.dev/), built by the folks at [\&lt;div\&gt;RIOTS](https://divriots.com/).

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Example](#example)
- [Quick Start](#quick-start)
- [Design Tokens](#design-tokens)
- [Extending](#extending)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

_Note that you must have node (and npm) installed._

If you want to use the CLI, you can install it globally via npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g style-dictionary
```

Or you can install it like a normal npm dependency. This is a build tool and you are most likely going to want to save it as a dev dependency:

```bash
$ npm install -D style-dictionary
```

If you want to install it with yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add style-dictionary --dev
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
$ style-dictionary build
```

Call this in the root directory of your project. The only thing needed is a `config.json` file. There are also arguments:

| Flag                    | Short Flag | Description                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| --config \[path\]       | -c         | Set the config file to use. Must be a .json file           |
| --platform \[platform\] | -p         | Only build a specific platform defined in the config file. |
| --help                  | -h         | Display help content                                       |
| --version               | -v         | Display the version                                        |

### Node

You can also use the style dictionary build system in node if you want to [extend](#extending) the functionality or use it in another build system like Grunt or Gulp.

```javascript
const StyleDictionary = require(&#039;style-dictionary&#039;).extend(&#039;config.json&#039;);

StyleDictionary.buildAllPlatforms();
```

The `.extend()` method is an overloaded method that can also take an object with the configuration in the same format as a config.json file.

```javascript
import { formats, transformGroups } from &#039;style-dictionary/enums&#039;;

const StyleDictionary = require(&#039;style-dictionary&#039;).extend({
  source: [&#039;tokens/**/*.json&#039;],
  platforms: {
    scss: {
      transformGroup: transformGroups.scss,
      buildPath: &#039;build/&#039;,
      files: [
        {
          destination: &#039;variables.scss&#039;,
          format: formats.scssVariables,
        },
      ],
    },
    // ...
  },
});

StyleDictionary.buildAllPlatforms();
```

A style dictionary is a collection of design tokens, key/value pairs that describe stylistic attributes like colors, sizes, icons, motion, etc. A style dictionary defines these design tokens in JSON or Javascript files, and can also include static assets like images and fonts. Here is a basic example of what the package structure can look like:

```
├── config.json
├── tokens/
│   ├── size/
│       ├── font.json
│   ├── color/
│       ├── font.json
│   ...
├── assets/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── images/
```

### config.json

This tells the style dictionary build system how and what to build. The default file path is `config.json` or `config.js` in the root of the project, but you can name it whatever you want by passing in the `--config` flag to the [CLI](https://styledictionary.com/getting-started/using_the_cli/).

```json
{
  &quot;source&quot;: [&quot;tokens/**/*.json&quot;],
  &quot;platforms&quot;: {
    &quot;scss&quot;: {
      &quot;transformGroup&quot;: &quot;scss&quot;,
      &quot;buildPath&quot;: &quot;build/&quot;,
      &quot;files&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;destination&quot;: &quot;scss/_variables.scss&quot;,
          &quot;format&quot;: &quot;scss/variables&quot;
        }
      ]
    },
    &quot;android&quot;: {
      &quot;transformGroup&quot;: &quot;android&quot;,
      &quot;buildPath&quot;: &quot;build/android/&quot;,
      &quot;files&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;destination&quot;: &quot;font_dimens.xml&quot;,
          &quot;format&quot;: &quot;android/fontDimens&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Design Tokens

```json
{
  &quot;size&quot;: {
    &quot;font&quot;: {
      &quot;small&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: &quot;10px&quot; },
      &quot;medium&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: &quot;16px&quot; },
      &quot;large&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: &quot;24px&quot; },
      &quot;base&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: &quot;{size.font.medium}&quot; }
    }
  }
}
```

Here we are creating some basic font size design tokens. The style definition size.font.small.value is &quot;10px&quot; for example. The style definition size.font.base.value is automatically aliased to the value found in size.font.medium.value and both of those resolve to &quot;16px&quot;.

Now what the style dictionary build system will do with this information is convert it to different formats, enabling these values to be used in any type of codebase. From this one file you can generate any number of files like:

```scss
$size-font-small: 10px;
$size-font-medium: 16px;
$size-font-large: 24px;
$size-font-base: 16px;
```

```xml
&lt;dimen name=&quot;font-small&quot;&gt;10sp&lt;/dimen&gt;
&lt;dimen name=&quot;font-medium&quot;&gt;16sp&lt;/dimen&gt;
&lt;dimen name=&quot;font-large&quot;&gt;24sp&lt;/dimen&gt;
&lt;dimen name=&quot;font-base&quot;&gt;16sp&lt;/dimen&gt;
```

```objc
float const SizeFontSmall = 10.00f;
float const SizeFontMedium = 16.00f;
float const SizeFontLarge = 24.00f;
float const SizeFontBase = 16.00f;
```

## Quick Start

The style dictionary framework comes with some example code to get you started. Install the node module globally, create a directory and `cd` into it.

```bash
$ npm i -g style-dictionary
$ mkdir MyStyleDictionary
$ cd MyStyleDictionary
```

Now run:

```bash
$ style-dictionary init basic
```

This command will copy over the example files found in [example](examples/) in this repo. Now you have an example project set up. You can make changes to the style dictionary and rebuild the project by running:

```bash
$ style-dictionary build
```

Take a look at the documentation for the example code.

## Design Tokens

A design token is an attribute to describe something visually. It is atomic (it cannot be broken down further). Design tokens have a name, a value, and optional attributes or metadata. The name of a token can be anything, but we have a proposed naming structure that we find works really well in the next section.

### Category/Type/Item Structure

While not exactly necessary, we feel this classification structure of design tokens makes the most sense semantically. Design tokens can be organized into a hierarchical tree structure with the top level, category, defining the primitive nature of the token. For example, we have the color category and every token underneath is always a color. As you proceed down the tree to type, item, sub-item, and state, you get more specific about what that color is. Is it a background color, a text color, or a border color? What kind of text color is it? You get the point. Now you can structure your token json files like simple objects:

```json
{
  &quot;size&quot;: {
    &quot;font&quot;: {
      &quot;base&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: &quot;16&quot; },
      &quot;large&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: &quot;20&quot; }
    }
  }
}
```

The CTI is implicit in the structure, the category and type is &#039;size&#039; and &#039;font&#039;, and there are 2 tokens &#039;base&#039; and &#039;large&#039;.

Structuring design tokens in this manner gives us consistent naming and accessing of these tokens. You don&#039;t need to remember if it is button_color_error or error_button_color, it is color_background_button_error!

You can organize and name your design tokens however you want, there are no restrictions. But we have a good amount of helpers if you do use this structure, like the &#039;attribute/cti&#039; transform which adds attributes to the token of its CTI based on the path in the object. There are a lot of name transforms as well for when you want a flat structure like for Sass variables.

Also, the CTI structure provides a good mechanism to target transforms for specific kinds of tokens. All of the transforms provided by the framework use the CTI of a token to know if it should be applied. For instance, the &#039;color/hex&#039; transform only applies to tokens of the category &#039;color&#039;.

You can also add a _comment_ to a design token:

```json
{
  &quot;size&quot;: {
    &quot;font&quot;: {
      &quot;base&quot;: {
        &quot;value&quot;: &quot;16&quot;,
        &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;the base size of the font&quot;
      },
      &quot;large&quot;: {
        &quot;value&quot;: &quot;20&quot;,
        &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;the large size of the font&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The comment will appear in the output files, where relevant or the output format supports comments.

## Extending

The style dictionary build system is made to be extended. We don&#039;t know exactly how everyone will want to use style dictionaries in their project, which is why you can create custom transforms and formats.

```javascript
const StyleDictionary = require(&#039;style-dictionary&#039;).extend(&#039;config.json&#039;);
import { transforms, transformTypes } from &#039;style-dictionary/enums&#039;;

StyleDictionary.registerTransform({
  name: transforms.timeSeconds,
  type: transformTypes.value,
  filter: function (token) {
    return token.type === &#039;time&#039;;
  },
  transform: function (token) {
    return (parseInt(token.original.value) / 1000).toString() + &#039;s&#039;;
  },
});

StyleDictionary.buildAllPlatforms();
```

For more information on creating your own transforms and formats, take a look at our [docs](https://styledictionary.com).

## Version 4

In May 2021, we started [an issue / RFC, &quot;What would you like to see in Style-Dictionary 4.0?&quot;](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/issues/643) to gather feedback on what the community would like to see.
Fortunately, in August 2023, the folks at [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/) contacted us about co-maintaining this project, and leading the v4 release (and beyond)!

We have started working on the biggest and most important changes, like migrating to ESM, making the library browser-compatible out of the box, and supporting asynchronicity in Style-Dictionary&#039;s various APIs. There will be multiple prereleases to battle-test these changes before a final v4.0 is released.

You can follow [this roadmap board](https://github.com/orgs/amzn/projects/4/views/1?layout=board) to keep an eye on the developments for v4.0, we will also keep adding to this board when we encounter changes we&#039;d like to see in v4.0 that would entail a breaking change. Absence of something in this roadmap does not mean we don&#039;t see value in it, but rather that it could also be added in a (non-breaking) minor release within v4.x.x.

### From the folks at Tokens Studio

Hi everyone! I&#039;m Joren from Tokens Studio, a big fan of this project (see [Style-Dictionary-Play](https://www.style-dictionary-play.dev/), [Token Configurator](https://configurator.tokens.studio/), [sd-transforms](https://github.com/tokens-studio/sd-transforms)) and the main pusher behind leading a 4.0 release of this project, I think it would be good to explain from our perspective why we&#039;ve made the move to collaborate with Amazon on this.

At Tokens Studio, we&#039;re a huge fan of Design Tokens and the workflows they enable. We believe exporting design tokens to various platforms is a key ingredient in ensuring that the journey from design to implementation code is smooth.
In our minds, Style-Dictionary has been the most popular and most flexible library for reaching that goal, and so we want to build on top of that.
Rather than starting our own spinoff tool, we much prefer bringing Style-Dictionary further, together with its vibrant community of contributors, which is why we reached out to Danny Banks.

I think it&#039;s important to stress that it is our shared vision to keep Style-Dictionary as an agnostic (so not &quot;Tokens Studio&quot;-specific) and flexible tool. As Tokens Studio, while we are highly incentivized to see this project progress further to strengthen our product journey, we value the open source community highly and want to make sure this library remains the go-to tool for exporting Design Tokens, whether you use Tokens Studio or not.

We are very open to feedback and collaboration, feel free to reach out to us in [our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tokens-studio/shared_invite/zt-1p8ea3m6t-C163oJcN9g3~YZTKRgo2hg) -&gt; `style-dictionary-v4` channel!

## Mascot

The mascot for Style Dictionary is [&quot;Pascal&quot;](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/issues/97) the chameleon (seen below). You can also find them blending in as the logo throughout the documentation.

&lt;img src=&quot;docs/src/assets/logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Style Dictionary logo and mascot&quot; title=&quot;&amp;quot;Pascal&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don&#039;t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.
* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you&#039;re looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).

Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from &#039;react-dom/client&#039;;

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(&#039;container&#039;));
root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name=&quot;Taylor&quot; /&gt;);
```

This example will render &quot;Hello Taylor&quot; into a container on the page.

You&#039;ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.

document.body.appendChild(canvas);

const app = new pc.Application(canvas);

// fill the available space at full resolution
app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW);
app.setCanvasResolution(pc.RESOLUTION_AUTO);

// ensure canvas is resized when window changes size
window.addEventListener(&#039;resize&#039;, () =&gt; app.resizeCanvas());

// create box entity
const box = new pc.Entity(&#039;cube&#039;);
box.addComponent(&#039;model&#039;, {
  type: &#039;box&#039;
});
app.root.addChild(box);

// create camera entity
const camera = new pc.Entity(&#039;camera&#039;);
camera.addComponent(&#039;camera&#039;, {
  clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
});
app.root.addChild(camera);
camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);

// create directional light entity
const light = new pc.Entity(&#039;light&#039;);
light.addComponent(&#039;light&#039;);
app.root.addChild(light);
light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

// rotate the box according to the delta time since the last frame
app.on(&#039;update&#039;, dt =&gt; box.rotate(10 * dt, 20 * dt, 30 * dt));

app.start();
```

## What is Label Studio?

&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

## Try out Label Studio

Install Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. Also you can try [Label Studio Teams](https://app.heartex.com).

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python &gt;=3.7 &lt;=3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you&#039;ve made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you&#039;re using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you&#039;re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

#### Run test suite
```bash
pip install -r deploy/requirements-test.txt
cd label_studio

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass)
DJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto
```

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).

# [p5.js](https://p5js.org)

Welcome! 👋👋🏿👋🏽👋🏻👋🏾👋🏼

p5.js is a free and open-source JavaScript library for [accessible](https://p5js.org/contribute/access) creative coding. It is a nurturing community, an approachable language, an exploratory tool, an accessible environment, an inclusive platform, welcoming and playful for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else!

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(255);
}

function draw() {
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 80);
}
```

&lt;/td&gt;

[Get Started](https://p5js.org/tutorials/get-started/) — [Reference](https://p5js.org/reference) — [Tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials) — [Examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) — [Libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries) — [Forum](https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js) — [Discord](https://discord.gg/SHQ8dH25r9)

## About

p5.js is built and organized to prioritize [accessibility, inclusivity, community, and joy](https://p5js.org/community). Similar to sketching, p5.js has a full set of tools to draw. It also supports creating audio-visual, interactive, experimental, and generative works for the web. p5.js enables thinking of a web page as your sketch. p5.js is accessible in multiple languages and has an expansive [documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/) with visual examples. You can find [tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/) on the p5.js website and start coding right now in the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). You can extend p5.js with many community-created [libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/) that bring different capabilities. Its community provides endless inspiration and support for creators.

p5.js encourages iterative and exploratory code for creative expression. Its friendly, diverse community shares art, code, and learning resources to help elevate all voices. We share our values in open source and access for all, to learn, create, imagine, design, share and code freely.

## Community

The p5.js community shares an interest in exploring the creation of art and design with technology. We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, disability, class, caste, religion, culture, subculture, immigration status, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We stand in solidarity with justice and liberation movements. We work to acknowledge, dismantle, and prevent barriers to access p5.js code and the p5.js community.

Learn more about [our community](https://p5js.org/community/) and read our community statement and [code of conduct](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). You can directly support our work with p5.js by donating to [the Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/support).

## 🌼 p5.js 2.0 Now Available for Community Testing &amp; Development!

We are releasing p5.js 2.0 to the community for testing and development! Here’s what you need to know.

* For **reference**: p5.js 1.x reference will stay on [https://p5js.org/](https://p5js.org/), and p5.js 2.x documentation will be on [https://beta.p5js.org/](https://beta.p5js.org/)
* In the p5.js Editor: the **default will continue to be 1.x** until at least August 2026 - more information and discussion on timeline can be found on [this Discourse thread](https://discourse.processing.org/t/dev-updates-p5-js-2-0-you-are-here/46130) or [this GitHub thread](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/7488)
* For updating sketches and add-on libraries: check out [the compatibility add-on libraries and guides](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-compatibility)
* For **contribution**: `npm latest` will default to 2.x, but the git branches are still separated with `main` on 1.x and `dev-2.0` on 2.x. We will switch the branches when we have updated all automations (including deploying updated documentation to the website). Want to contribute ideas or implementation? Check the [2.x project board](https://github.com/orgs/processing/projects/21/views/8) for an overview of what still needs discussion, and what’s ready for work!

p5.js was created by [Lauren Lee McCarthy](https://github.com/lmccart) in 2013 as a new interpretation of Processing for the context of the web. Since then we have allowed ourselves space to deviate and grow, while drawing inspiration from Processing and our shared community. p5.js is sustained by a community of contributors, with support from the Processing Foundation. p5.js follows a rotating leadership model started in 2020, and [Qianqian Ye](https://github.com/qianqianye) has been leading p5.js since 2021.

  # _Send it_, with [PairDrop](https://pairdrop.net)

  &lt;p&gt;
    Local file sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pairdrop.net&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in your web browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
    &lt;br&gt;
    Inspired by Apple&#039;s AirDrop.
    &lt;br&gt; 
    Fork of Snapdrop.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;

## Differences to the [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop) it is based on
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;View all differences&lt;/summary&gt;

### Paired Devices and Public Rooms — Internet Transfer
* Transfer files over the Internet between paired devices or by entering temporary public rooms.
* Connect to devices in complex network environments (public Wi-Fi, company network, iCloud Private Relay, VPN, etc.).
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* Devices outside of your local network that are behind a NAT are auto-connected via the PairDrop TURN server.
* Devices from the local network, in the same public room, or previously paired are shown.

#### Persistent Device Pairing

Always connect to known devices

* Pair devices via a 6-digit code or a QR-Code.
* Paired devices always find each other via shared secrets independently of their local network. 
* Pairing is persistent. You find your devices even after reopening PairDrop.
* You can edit and unpair devices easily.

#### Temporary Public Rooms

Connect to others in complex network situations, or over the Internet.

* Enter a public room via a 5-letter code or a QR-code.
* Enter a public room to temporarily connect to devices outside your local network.
* All devices in the same public room see each other.
* Public rooms are temporary. Closing PairDrop  leaves all rooms.

### [Improved UI for Sending/Receiving Files](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/issues/560)
* Files are transferred after a request is accepted. Files are auto-downloaded upon completing a transfer, if possible.
* Multiple files are downloaded as a ZIP file
* Download, share or save to gallery via the &quot;Share&quot; menu on Android and iOS.
* Multiple files are transferred at once with an overall progress indicator.

### Send Files or Text Directly From Share Menu, Context Menu or CLI
* [Send files directly from context menu on Ubuntu (using Nautilus)](docs/how-to.md#send-multiple-files-and-directories-directly-from-context-menu-on-ubuntu-using-nautilus)
* [Send files directly from the context menu on Windows](docs/how-to.md#send-files-directly-from-context-menu-on-windows)
* [Send directly from the &quot;Share&quot; menu on iOS](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-ios)
* [Send directly from the &quot;Share&quot; menu on Android](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-android)
* [Send directly via the command-line interface](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-via-command-line-interface)

### Other Changes
* Change your display name to easily differentiate your devices.
* [Paste files/text and choose the recipient afterwards ](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/534)
* [Prevent devices from sleeping on file transfer](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/413)
* Warn user before PairDrop is closed on file transfer
* Open PairDrop on multiple tabs simultaneously (Thanks [@willstott101](https://github.com/willstott101))
* [Video and audio preview](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/455) (Thanks [@victorwads](https://github.com/victorwads))
* Switch theme back to auto/system after dark or light mode is on
* Node-only implementation (Thanks [@Bellisario](https://github.com/Bellisario))
* Auto-restart on error (Thanks [@KaKi87](https://github.com/KaKi87))
* Lots of stability fixes (Thanks [@MWY001](https://github.com/MWY001) [@skiby7](https://github.com/skiby7) and [@willstott101](https://github.com/willstott101))
* To host PairDrop on your local network (e.g. on Raspberry Pi): [All peers connected with private IPs are discoverable by each other](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/558)
* When hosting PairDrop yourself, you can [set your own STUN/TURN servers](docs/host-your-own.md#specify-stunturn-servers)
* Translations.

&lt;/details&gt;

2. For PNPM: Run either `config=true pnpm start` or `$env:config=true; pnpm start`, depending on your server.
3. For Bun: Run either `config=true bun start` or `$env:config=true; bun start` if you prefer Bun.
4. For NPM: Run either `config=true npm start` or `$env:config=true; npm start` if you prefer NPM.

git clone https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar
cd Interstellar
```

#### What happened to Replit Deployment?

As of January 1st, 2024, Replit is [no longer free](https://blog.replit.com/hosting-changes). Try GitHub Codespaces instead.

### GitHub Codespaces

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re setting the port below 1023, then you must run `sudo PORT=1023`

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven&#039;t already.
2. Click &quot;Code&quot; (green button) and then &quot;Create Codespace on main.&quot;
3. In the terminal at the bottom, paste `pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm start`.
4. Respond to the application popup by clicking &quot;Make public.&quot;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Make sure you click the &quot;Make public.&quot; button, or the proxy won&#039;t function properly.&lt;br&gt;
&gt; If you get a Range Error, go back and make sure you clicked Make public!
5. Access the deployed website from the ports tab.
6. For subsequent uses in the same codespace, just run `pnpm start`

### Solution for if there is no popup.

1. Run `pnpm i`, and before `pnpm start`, prepend `PORT=8080`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `PORT=6969 pnpm start`.
2. If this does not work then you can prepend `$env:PORT=8080;`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `$env:PORT=6969; pnpm start`
3. Go to the ports tab, Click Forward A Port, And type the port number.
4. Right-click Visibility and set Port Visibility to Public.
