ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

- ESLint uses [Espree](https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/espree) for JavaScript parsing.
- ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
- ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`^20.19.0`, `^22.13.0`, or `&gt;=24`) built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)

You can install and configure ESLint using this command:

```shell
npm init @eslint/config@latest
```

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:

```shell
npx eslint yourfile.js
```

### pnpm Installation

To use ESLint with pnpm, we recommend setting up a `.npmrc` file with at least the following settings:

```text
auto-install-peers=true
node-linker=hoisted
```

This ensures that pnpm installs dependencies in a way that is more compatible with npm and is less likely to produce errors.

## Configuration

You can configure rules in your `eslint.config.js` files as in this example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from &quot;eslint/config&quot;;

export default defineConfig([
	{
		files: [&quot;**/*.js&quot;, &quot;**/*.cjs&quot;, &quot;**/*.mjs&quot;],
		rules: {
			&quot;prefer-const&quot;: &quot;warn&quot;,
			&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
		},
	},
]);
```

The names `&quot;prefer-const&quot;` and `&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;` are the names of [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules) in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:

- `&quot;off&quot;` or `0` - turn the rule off
- `&quot;warn&quot;` or `1` - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn&#039;t affect exit code)
- `&quot;error&quot;` or `2` - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the [configuration docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)).

## Version Support

The ESLint team provides ongoing support for the current version and six months of limited support for the previous version. Limited support includes critical bug fixes, security issues, and compatibility issues only.

ESLint offers commercial support for both current and previous versions through our partners, [Tidelift][tidelift] and [HeroDevs][herodevs].

See [Version Support](https://eslint.org/version-support) for more details.

## Code of Conduct

ESLint adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://eslint.org/conduct).

## Filing Issues

Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you&#039;re reporting:

- [Bug Report](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/report-bugs)
- [Propose a New Rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-new-rule)
- [Proposing a Rule Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-rule-change)
- [Request a Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/request-change)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does ESLint support JSX?

Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)). Please note that supporting JSX syntax _is not_ the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn&#039;t recognize. We recommend using [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react) if you are using React and want React semantics.

### Does Prettier replace ESLint?

No, ESLint and Prettier have different jobs: ESLint is a linter (looking for problematic patterns) and Prettier is a code formatter. Using both tools is common, refer to [Prettier&#039;s documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install#eslint-and-other-linters) to learn how to configure them to work well with each other.

### What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?

ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5, and every year from 2015 up until the most recent stage 4 specification (the default). You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax and other settings (like global variables) through [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure).

### What about experimental features?

ESLint&#039;s parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.

In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use [@babel/eslint-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser) and [@babel/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-plugin) to use any option available in Babel.

Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the [TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/)), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our [contributing guidelines](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute). Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.

### Which Node.js versions does ESLint support?

ESLint updates the supported Node.js versions with each major release of ESLint. At that time, ESLint&#039;s supported Node.js versions are updated to be:

1. The most recent maintenance release of Node.js
1. The lowest minor version of the Node.js LTS release that includes the features the ESLint team wants to use.
1. The Node.js Current release

ESLint is also expected to work with Node.js versions released after the Node.js Current release.

Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#prerequisites) for the officially supported Node.js versions for a given ESLint release.

### Where to ask for help?

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions) or stop by our [Discord server](https://eslint.org/chat).

### Why doesn&#039;t ESLint lock dependency versions?

Lock files like `package-lock.json` are helpful for deployed applications. They ensure that dependencies are consistent between environments and across deployments.

Packages like `eslint` that get published to the npm registry do not include lock files. `npm install eslint` as a user will respect version constraints in ESLint&#039;s `package.json`. ESLint and its dependencies will be included in the user&#039;s lock file if one exists, but ESLint&#039;s own lock file would not be used.

We intentionally don&#039;t lock dependency versions so that we have the latest compatible dependency versions in development and CI that our users get when installing ESLint in a project.

The Twilio blog has a [deeper dive](https://www.twilio.com/blog/lockfiles-nodejs) to learn more.

## Releases

We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a [release issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arelease) for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.

## Security Policy

ESLint takes security seriously. We work hard to ensure that ESLint is safe for everyone and that security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly. Read the full [security policy](https://github.com/eslint/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Semantic Versioning Policy

ESLint follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it&#039;s not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we&#039;ve defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint:

- Patch release (intended to not break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer linting errors.
    - A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).
    - Improvements to documentation.
    - Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.
    - Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn&#039;t work for anyone).
- Minor release (might break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors.
    - A new rule is created.
    - A new option to an existing rule that does not result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - A new addition to an existing rule to support a newly-added language feature (within the last 12 months) that will result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing rule is deprecated.
    - A new CLI capability is created.
    - New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).
    - A new formatter is created.
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and will result in strictly fewer linting errors (e.g., rule removals).
- Major release (likely to break your lint build)
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and may result in new linting errors (e.g., rule additions, most rule option updates).
    - A new option to an existing rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing formatter is removed.
    - Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. The public API includes:
        - Rule schemas
        - Configuration schema
        - Command-line options
        - Node.js API
        - Rule, formatter, parser, plugin APIs

According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` e.g. `&quot;eslint&quot;: &quot;~3.1.0&quot;` to guarantee the results of your builds.

## ESM Dependencies

Since ESLint is a CommonJS package, there are restrictions on which ESM-only packages can be used as dependencies.

Packages that are controlled by the ESLint team and have no external dependencies can be safely loaded synchronously using [`require(esm)`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-ecmascript-modules-using-require) and therefore used in any contexts.

For external packages, we don&#039;t use `require(esm)` because a package could add a top-level `await` and thus break ESLint. We can use an external ESM-only package only in case it is needed only in asynchronous code, in which case it can be loaded using dynamic `import()`.

## How to Install Customizations

To make it easy to add these customizations to your editor, we have created an [MCP Server](https://developer.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-awesome-copilot-mcp-server) that provides a prompt for searching and installing prompts, instructions, agents, and skills directly from this repository. You&#039;ll need to have Docker installed and running to run the MCP server locally.

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install-0098FF?logo=visualstudiocode&amp;logoColor=white)](https://aka.ms/awesome-copilot/mcp/vscode) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install-24bfa5?logo=visualstudiocode&amp;logoColor=white)](https://aka.ms/awesome-copilot/mcp/vscode-insiders) [![Install in Visual Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio-Install-C16FDE?logo=visualstudio&amp;logoColor=white)](https://aka.ms/awesome-copilot/mcp/vs)

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Show MCP Server JSON configuration&lt;/summary&gt;

  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;awesome-copilot&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [

        &quot;ghcr.io/microsoft/mcp-dotnet-samples/awesome-copilot:latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## 📄 llms.txt

An [`llms.txt`](https://github.github.io/awesome-copilot/llms.txt) file following the [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) specification is available on the GitHub Pages site. This machine-readable file makes it easy for Large Language Models to discover and understand all available agents, prompts, instructions, and skills, providing a structured overview of the repository&#039;s resources with names and descriptions.

## 🔧 How to Use

### 🔌 Plugins

Plugins are installable packages that bundle related agents, commands (prompts), and skills, making it easy to install a curated set of resources.

#### Installing Plugins

First, add the Awesome Copilot marketplace to your Copilot CLI:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add github/awesome-copilot
```

Then install any plugin:

```bash
copilot plugin install &lt;plugin-name&gt;@awesome-copilot
```

Alternatively, you can use the `/plugin` command within a Copilot chat session to browse and install plugins interactively.

### 🤖 Custom Agents

Custom agents can be used in Copilot coding agent (CCA), VS Code, and Copilot CLI (coming soon). For CCA, when assigning an issue to Copilot, select the custom agent from the provided list. In VS Code, you can activate the custom agent in the agents session, alongside built-in agents like Plan and Agent.

### 🎯 Prompts

Use the `/` command in GitHub Copilot Chat to access prompts:

```plaintext
/awesome-copilot create-readme
```

### 📋 Instructions

Instructions automatically apply to files based on their patterns and provide contextual guidance for coding standards, frameworks, and best practices.

### 🪝 Hooks

Hooks enable automated workflows triggered by specific events during GitHub Copilot coding agent sessions (like sessionStart, sessionEnd, userPromptSubmitted). They can automate tasks like logging, auto-committing changes, or integrating with external services.

## 🎯 Why Use Awesome GitHub Copilot?

- **Productivity**: Pre-built agents, prompts and instructions save time and provide consistent results.
- **Best Practices**: Benefit from community-curated coding standards and patterns.
- **Specialized Assistance**: Access expert-level guidance through specialized custom agents.
- **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with the latest patterns and practices across technologies.

## Mission

**The world is rushing to build AI systems. It is not engineering them.**

That gap is what we mean by AI engineering.

**AI engineering is the discipline of building efficient, reliable, safe, and robust intelligent systems that operate in the real world, not just models in isolation.**

**Our mission:** Establish AI engineering as a foundational discipline, alongside software engineering and computer engineering, by teaching how to design, build, and evaluate end to end intelligent systems. The long term impact of AI will be shaped by engineers who can turn ideas into working, dependable systems.

## What’s in this repo

This repository is the open learning stack for AI systems engineering.

It includes the textbook source, TinyTorch, hardware kits, and upcoming co-labs that connect principles to runnable code and real devices.

## Start Here

Choose a path based on your goal.

**READ** Start with the [textbook](https://mlsysbook.ai). Try [Chapter 1](https://www.mlsysbook.ai/book/contents/core/introduction/introduction.html) and the [Benchmarking chapter](https://mlsysbook.ai/book/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html).

**BUILD** Start TinyTorch with the [getting started guide](https://mlsysbook.ai/tinytorch/getting-started.html). Begin with Module 01 and work up from CNNs to transformers and the MLPerf benchmarks.

**DEPLOY** Pick a [hardware kit](https://mlsysbook.ai/kits) and run the labs on Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other edge devices.

**CONNECT** Say hello in [Discussions](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/discussions). We will do our best to reply.

**What each path teaches:**
- **EXPLORE** teaches *why* — Understand tradeoffs. Change batch sizes, precision, model architectures and see how latency, memory, and accuracy shift.
- **BUILD** teaches *how* — Understand internals. Implement autograd, optimizers, and attention from scratch to see how TensorFlow and PyTorch actually work.
- **DEPLOY** teaches *where* — Understand constraints. Face real memory limits, power budgets, and latency requirements on actual hardware.

## What Makes This Different

This is a living textbook. We keep it updated as the field grows, with community input along the way.

AI may feel like it is moving at lightning speed, but the engineering building blocks that make it work do not change as quickly as the headlines. This project is built around those stable foundations.

Think of it like LEGO. New sets arrive all the time, but the bricks themselves stay the same. Once you learn how the bricks fit together, you can build anything. Here, those &quot;AI bricks&quot; are the solid systems principles that make AI work.

Whether you are reading a chapter, running a lab, or sharing feedback, you are helping make these ideas more accessible to the next learner.

### Research to Teaching Loop

We use the same loop for research and teaching: define the system problem, build a reference implementation, benchmark it, then turn it into curriculum and tooling so others can reproduce and extend it.

| Loop Step | Research Artifacts | Teaching Artifacts |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Measure** | Benchmarks, suites, metrics | Benchmarking chapter, assignments |
| **Build** | Reference systems, compilers, runtimes | TinyTorch modules, co-labs |
| **Deploy** | Hardware targets, constraints, reliability | Hardware labs, kits |

## Support This Work

We are working toward **1 million learners by 2030** so that AI engineering becomes a shared, teachable discipline, not a collection of isolated practices. Every star, share, and contribution helps move this effort forward.

### Why GitHub Stars Matter

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

*What gets measured gets improved.*

Each star is a learner, educator, or supporter who believes AI systems should be engineered with rigor and real world constraints in mind.

[![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/harvard-edge/cs249r_book?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;color=gold)](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/stargazers)

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;Date)

1 learner → 10 learners → 100 learners → 1,000 learners → **10,000 learners** → 100,000 learners → **1M learners**

&lt;/div&gt;

Stars are not the goal. They are a signal.

A visible, growing community makes it easier for universities, foundations, and industry partners to adopt this material, donate hardware, and fund workshops. That momentum lowers the barrier for the next institution, the next classroom, and the next cohort of learners.

Support raised through this signal flows into [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook) and funds concrete outcomes such as TinyML4D workshops, hardware kits for underserved classrooms, and the infrastructure required to keep this resource free and open.

One click can unlock the next classroom, the next contributor, and the next generation of AI engineers.

### Fund the Mission

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

All contributions go to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook), a transparent fund that supports educational outreach.

# GET SHIT DONE

**A light-weight and powerful meta-prompting, context engineering and spec-driven development system for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Gemini CLI.**

**Solves context rot — the quality degradation that happens as Claude fills its context window.**

&lt;br&gt;

*&quot;If you know clearly what you want, this WILL build it for you. No bs.&quot;*

*&quot;I&#039;ve done SpecKit, OpenSpec and Taskmaster — this has produced the best results for me.&quot;*

*&quot;By far the most powerful addition to my Claude Code. Nothing over-engineered. Literally just gets shit done.&quot;*

&lt;br&gt;

**Trusted by engineers at Amazon, Google, Shopify, and Webflow.**

## Why I Built This

I&#039;m a solo developer. I don&#039;t write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you&#039;re building. I&#039;m not a 50-person software company. I don&#039;t want to play enterprise theater. I&#039;m just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work *and* verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That&#039;s what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.

— **TÂCHES**

---

Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It&#039;s the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.

---

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they&#039;re running a 50-person engineering org.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

The installer prompts you to choose:
1. **Runtime** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, or all
2. **Location** — Global (all projects) or local (current project only)

Verify with `/gsd:help` inside your chosen runtime.

### Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# Claude Code
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --global   # Install to ~/.claude/
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local    # Install to ./.claude/

# OpenCode (open source, free models)
npx get-shit-done-cc --opencode --global # Install to ~/.config/opencode/

# Gemini CLI
npx get-shit-done-cc --gemini --global   # Install to ~/.gemini/

# All runtimes
npx get-shit-done-cc --all --global      # Install to all directories
```

Use `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the location prompt.
Use `--claude`, `--opencode`, `--gemini`, or `--all` to skip the runtime prompt.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Clone the repository and run the installer locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done.git
cd get-shit-done
node bin/install.js --claude --local
```

Installs to `./.claude/` for testing modifications before contributing.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Recommended: Skip Permissions Mode

GSD is designed for frictionless automation. Run Claude Code with:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; This is how GSD is intended to be used — stopping to approve `date` and `git commit` 50 times defeats the purpose.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative: Granular Permissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

If you prefer not to use that flag, add this to your project&#039;s `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allow&quot;: [
      &quot;Bash(date:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(echo:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(cat:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(ls:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(mkdir:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(wc:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(head:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(tail:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(sort:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(grep:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(tr:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git add:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git commit:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git status:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git log:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git diff:*)&quot;,
      &quot;Bash(git tag:*)&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## How It Works

&gt; **Already have code?** Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first. It spawns parallel agents to analyze your stack, architecture, conventions, and concerns. Then `/gsd:new-project` knows your codebase — questions focus on what you&#039;re adding, and planning automatically loads your patterns.

### 1. Initialize Project

```
/gsd:new-project
```

One command, one flow. The system:

1. **Questions** — Asks until it understands your idea completely (goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases)
2. **Research** — Spawns parallel agents to investigate the domain (optional but recommended)
3. **Requirements** — Extracts what&#039;s v1, v2, and out of scope
4. **Roadmap** — Creates phases mapped to requirements

You approve the roadmap. Now you&#039;re ready to build.

**Creates:** `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, `.planning/research/`

---

### 2. Discuss Phase

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 1
```

**This is where you shape the implementation.**

Your roadmap has a sentence or two per phase. That&#039;s not enough context to build something the way *you* imagine it. This step captures your preferences before anything gets researched or planned.

The system analyzes the phase and identifies gray areas based on what&#039;s being built:

- **Visual features** → Layout, density, interactions, empty states
- **APIs/CLIs** → Response format, flags, error handling, verbosity
- **Content systems** → Structure, tone, depth, flow
- **Organization tasks** → Grouping criteria, naming, duplicates, exceptions

For each area you select, it asks until you&#039;re satisfied. The output — `CONTEXT.md` — feeds directly into the next two steps:

1. **Researcher reads it** — Knows what patterns to investigate (&quot;user wants card layout&quot; → research card component libraries)
2. **Planner reads it** — Knows what decisions are locked (&quot;infinite scroll decided&quot; → plan includes scroll handling)

The deeper you go here, the more the system builds what you actually want. Skip it and you get reasonable defaults. Use it and you get *your* vision.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md`

---

### 3. Plan Phase

```
/gsd:plan-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Researches** — Investigates how to implement this phase, guided by your CONTEXT.md decisions
2. **Plans** — Creates 2-3 atomic task plans with XML structure
3. **Verifies** — Checks plans against requirements, loops until they pass

Each plan is small enough to execute in a fresh context window. No degradation, no &quot;I&#039;ll be more concise now.&quot;

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-RESEARCH.md`, `{phase_num}-{N}-PLAN.md`

---

### 4. Execute Phase

```
/gsd:execute-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Runs plans in waves** — Parallel where possible, sequential when dependent
2. **Fresh context per plan** — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage
3. **Commits per task** — Every task gets its own atomic commit
4. **Verifies against goals** — Checks the codebase delivers what the phase promised

Walk away, come back to completed work with clean git history.

**How Wave Execution Works:**

Plans are grouped into &quot;waves&quot; based on dependencies. Within each wave, plans run in parallel. Waves run sequentially.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE EXECUTION                                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                      │
│  WAVE 1 (parallel)          WAVE 2 (parallel)          WAVE 3       │
│  ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ │
│  │ Plan 01 │ │ Plan 02 │ →  │ Plan 03 │ │ Plan 04 │ →  │ Plan 05 │ │
│  │         │ │         │    │         │ │         │    │         │ │
│  │ User    │ │ Product │    │ Orders  │ │ Cart    │    │ Checkout│ │
│  │ Model   │ │ Model   │    │ API     │ │ API     │    │ UI      │ │
│  └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ │
│       │           │              ↑           ↑              ↑       │
│       └───────────┴──────────────┴───────────┘              │       │
│              Dependencies: Plan 03 needs Plan 01            │       │
│                          Plan 04 needs Plan 02              │       │
│                          Plan 05 needs Plans 03 + 04        │       │
│                                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why waves matter:**
- Independent plans → Same wave → Run in parallel
- Dependent plans → Later wave → Wait for dependencies
- File conflicts → Sequential plans or same plan

This is why &quot;vertical slices&quot; (Plan 01: User feature end-to-end) parallelize better than &quot;horizontal layers&quot; (Plan 01: All models, Plan 02: All APIs).

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-{N}-SUMMARY.md`, `{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md`

---

### 5. Verify Work

```
/gsd:verify-work 1
```

**This is where you confirm it actually works.**

Automated verification checks that code exists and tests pass. But does the feature *work* the way you expected? This is your chance to use it.

The system:

1. **Extracts testable deliverables** — What you should be able to do now
2. **Walks you through one at a time** — &quot;Can you log in with email?&quot; Yes/no, or describe what&#039;s wrong
3. **Diagnoses failures automatically** — Spawns debug agents to find root causes
4. **Creates verified fix plans** — Ready for immediate re-execution

If everything passes, you move on. If something&#039;s broken, you don&#039;t manually debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again with the fix plans it created.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-UAT.md`, fix plans if issues found

---

### 6. Repeat → Complete → Next Milestone

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 2
/gsd:plan-phase 2
/gsd:execute-phase 2
/gsd:verify-work 2
...
/gsd:complete-milestone
/gsd:new-milestone
```

Loop **discuss → plan → execute → verify** until milestone complete.

Each phase gets your input (discuss), proper research (plan), clean execution (execute), and human verification (verify). Context stays fresh. Quality stays high.

When all phases are done, `/gsd:complete-milestone` archives the milestone and tags the release.

Then `/gsd:new-milestone` starts the next version — same flow as `new-project` but for your existing codebase. You describe what you want to build next, the system researches the domain, you scope requirements, and it creates a fresh roadmap. Each milestone is a clean cycle: define → build → ship.

---

### Quick Mode

```
/gsd:quick
```

**For ad-hoc tasks that don&#039;t need full planning.**

Quick mode gives you GSD guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) with a faster path:

- **Same agents** — Planner + executor, same quality
- **Skips optional steps** — No research, no plan checker, no verifier
- **Separate tracking** — Lives in `.planning/quick/`, not phases

Use for: bug fixes, small features, config changes, one-off tasks.

```
/gsd:quick
&gt; What do you want to do? &quot;Add dark mode toggle to settings&quot;
```

**Creates:** `.planning/quick/001-add-dark-mode-toggle/PLAN.md`, `SUMMARY.md`

---

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

Claude Code is incredibly powerful *if* you give it the context it needs. Most people don&#039;t.

GSD handles it for you:

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded |
| `research/` | Ecosystem knowledge (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Scoped v1/v2 requirements with phase traceability |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you&#039;re going, what&#039;s done |
| `STATE.md` | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |
| `PLAN.md` | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps |
| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history |
| `todos/` | Captured ideas and tasks for later work |

Size limits based on where Claude&#039;s quality degrades. Stay under, get consistent excellence.

### XML Prompt Formatting

Every plan is structured XML optimized for Claude:

```xml
&lt;task type=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Create login endpoint&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;files&gt;src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts&lt;/files&gt;
  &lt;action&gt;
    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).
    Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  &lt;/action&gt;
  &lt;verify&gt;curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie&lt;/verify&gt;
  &lt;done&gt;Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401&lt;/done&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;
```

Precise instructions. No guessing. Verification built in.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Every stage uses the same pattern: a thin orchestrator spawns specialized agents, collects results, and routes to the next step.

| Stage | Orchestrator does | Agents do |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Research | Coordinates, presents findings | 4 parallel researchers investigate stack, features, architecture, pitfalls |
| Planning | Validates, manages iteration | Planner creates plans, checker verifies, loop until pass |
| Execution | Groups into waves, tracks progress | Executors implement in parallel, each with fresh 200k context |
| Verification | Presents results, routes next | Verifier checks codebase against goals, debuggers diagnose failures |

The orchestrator never does heavy lifting. It spawns agents, waits, integrates results.

**The result:** You can run an entire phase — deep research, multiple plans created and verified, thousands of lines of code written across parallel executors, automated verification against goals — and your main context window stays at 30-40%. The work happens in fresh subagent contexts. Your session stays fast and responsive.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

```bash
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing
lmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **Benefits:** Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task independently revertable. Clear history for Claude in future sessions. Better observability in AI-automated workflow.

Every commit is surgical, traceable, and meaningful.

### Modular by Design

- Add phases to current milestone
- Insert urgent work between phases
- Complete milestones and start fresh
- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything

You&#039;re never locked in. The system adapts.

# Apollo for Reddit with ImprovedCustomAPI

This AltStore source provides pre-built releases of [Apollo App (Christian Selig)](https://apolloapp.io/) injected with [ImprovedCustomApi (JeffreyCA)](https://github.com/JeffreyCA/Apollo-ImprovedCustomApi).

It uses version `1.15.11` of the app and the latest release of the tweak.

Before raising any issues, please check the [ImprovedCustomApi](https://github.com/JeffreyCA/Apollo-ImprovedCustomApi/issues) repo first - as this source only integrates it.

## Available Sources

| Version | Best For | Features |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Standard** | Most users | Apollo injected with ImprovedCustomApi |
| **No Extensions** | Free Apple Developer accounts | Apollo injected with ImprovedCustomApi and removed extensions - Uses fewer App IDs (1 vs 7) |
| **GLASS** | iOS 26+ users | Apollo injected with ImprovedCustomApi and Liquid Glass UI Patch (iOS 26+) |
| **No Extensions + LIQUID GLASS** | iOS 26 + Free accounts | Combines both options |

A full-stack application that enables you to turn any document, resource, or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as a reference during chatting. This application allows you to pick and choose which LLM or Vector Database you want to use as well as supporting multi-user management and permissions.

### Product Overview

AnythingLLM is a full-stack application where you can use commercial off-the-shelf LLMs or popular open source LLMs and vectorDB solutions to build a private ChatGPT with no compromises that you can run locally as well as host remotely and be able to chat intelligently with any documents you provide it.

AnythingLLM divides your documents into objects called `workspaces`. A Workspace functions a lot like a thread, but with the addition of containerization of your documents. Workspaces can share documents, but they do not talk to each other so you can keep your context for each workspace clean.

### Technical Overview

This monorepo consists of six main sections:

- `frontend`: A viteJS + React frontend that you can run to easily create and manage all your content the LLM can use.
- `server`: A NodeJS express server to handle all the interactions and do all the vectorDB management and LLM interactions.
- `collector`: NodeJS express server that processes and parses documents from the UI.
- `docker`: Docker instructions and build process + information for building from source.
- `embed`: Submodule for generation &amp; creation of the [web embed widget](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-embed).
- `browser-extension`: Submodule for the [chrome browser extension](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-extension).

## 🛳 Self-Hosting

## How to setup for development

- `yarn setup` To fill in the required `.env` files you&#039;ll need in each of the application sections (from root of repo).
  - Go fill those out before proceeding. Ensure `server/.env.development` is filled or else things won&#039;t work right.
- `yarn dev:server` To boot the server locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:frontend` To boot the frontend locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:collector` To then run the document collector (from root of repo).

## Telemetry &amp; Privacy

AnythingLLM by Mintplex Labs Inc contains a telemetry feature that collects anonymous usage information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;More about Telemetry &amp; Privacy for AnythingLLM&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

### Why?

We use this information to help us understand how AnythingLLM is used, to help us prioritize work on new features and bug fixes, and to help us improve AnythingLLM&#039;s performance and stability.

### Opting out

Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` in your server or docker .env settings to &quot;true&quot; to opt out of telemetry. You can also do this in-app by going to the sidebar &gt; `Privacy` and disabling telemetry.

### What do you explicitly track?

We will only track usage details that help us make product and roadmap decisions, specifically:

- Type of your installation (Docker or Desktop)

- When a document is added or removed. No information _about_ the document. Just that the event occurred. This gives us an idea of use.

- Type of vector database in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider.

- Type of LLM provider &amp; model tag in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider or model, or combination thereof. eg: reasoning vs regular, multi-modal models, etc.

- When a chat is sent. This is the most regular &quot;event&quot; and gives us an idea of the daily-activity of this project across all installations. Again, only the **event** is sent - we have no information on the nature or content of the chat itself.

You can verify these claims by finding all locations `Telemetry.sendTelemetry` is called. Additionally these events are written to the output log so you can also see the specific data which was sent - if enabled. **No IP or other identifying information is collected**. The Telemetry provider is [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) - an open-source telemetry collection service.

We take privacy very seriously, and we hope you understand that we want to learn how our tool is used, without using annoying popup surveys, so we can build something worth using. The anonymous data is _never_ shared with third parties, ever.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Love open source? We&#039;re hiring! Ghost is looking staff engineers to [join the team](https://careers.ghost.org) and work with us full-time

&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/353959/169805900-66be5b89-0859-4816-8da9-528ed7534704.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fiercely independent, professional publishing. Ghost is the most popular open source, headless Node.js CMS which already works with all the tools you know and love.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

The easiest way to get a production instance deployed is with our official **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** managed service. It takes about 2 minutes to launch a new site with worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance all done for you.

For most people this ends up being the best value option because of [how much time it saves](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/) — and 100% of revenue goes to the Ghost Foundation; funding the maintenance and further development of the project itself. So you’ll be supporting open source software *and* getting a great service!

&amp;nbsp;

# Quickstart install

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our **CLI tool**

```
npm install ghost-cli -g
```

&amp;nbsp;

Then, if installing locally add the `local` flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

```
ghost install local
```

&amp;nbsp;

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/)

```
ghost install
```

&amp;nbsp;

Check out our [official documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/) for more information about our [recommended hosting stack](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/) &amp; properly [upgrading Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/update/), plus everything you need to develop your own Ghost [themes](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/) or work with [our API](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/).

### Contributors &amp; advanced developers

## About

draw.io is a configurable diagramming and whiteboarding application, jointly owned and developed by draw.io Ltd (previously named JGraph) and draw.io AG. We also run a production deployment at https://app.diagrams.net.

## License

The source code in this repository is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

The icon sets, stencil libraries, and diagram templates are provided under the following terms:

&gt; The icon sets and stencil libraries included in this software, and any derivatives thereof (including conversions to other formats, traced reproductions, substantially similar visual representations, or AI-generated images created using these icons as reference or training input), may not be used as software assets in, distributed for use with, or incorporated into Atlassian products or products distributed through the Atlassian marketplace or plugin ecosystem, without explicit written permission.
&gt;
&gt; This restriction does not apply to end-user diagram output (such as exported images or documents) created using this software.

Some icons are originally defined by third-party copyright holders; we have verified that all original licenses permit use in this project. Additional third-party JavaScript libraries are included, all with licenses compatible with Apache 2.0 (no GPL or AGPL).

We make no copyright claim on diagrams you create with this software.

## Contributions

We do not accept pull requests. The project is developed entirely by the core team. The entire draw.io editor is human written by the core, full-time development team, no AI generation. 

## Scope

draw.io is a diagramming and whiteboarding application. It is not an SVG editor. SVG export is intended for embedding in web pages, not for editing in other tools.

Note that draw.io does not support real-time collaborative editing in this version, currently.

For issues or questions about the editor in any draw.io product, the issue tracker and discussions here are a good starting point.

## Running

Options for running draw.io:

- Fork this repository and [publish to GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) for a [fully functional editor](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) (without integrations)
- Use the [official Docker image](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio)
- Download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net)

Packaged .war files are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).

## Supported Browsers

Chrome 123+, Firefox 120+, Safari 17.5+, Opera 109+, Edge 123+, WebView Android 137+, Safari iOS 18.5+.

## Trademark

draw.io is a registered EU trademark (#018062448).

Do not use the draw.io name or logo in ways that suggest affiliation with, endorsement by, or sponsorship by draw.io. Do not use draw.io logos for your own business, product, project, domain, or social media presence. Do not modify the draw.io logos. Use of draw.io trademarks requires prior written permission.</pre>

## Video Walkthrough

# [![Immersive Language Learning Walkthrough](http://img.youtube.com/vi/cdATDhw66pk/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdATDhw66pk)


## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone &lt;repository-url&gt;
cd immersive-language-learning-with-live-api
```

### 2. Quick Install

Run the installation script to set up both backend (Python venv) and frontend (Node modules) dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

### 3. Environment Config

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your Google Cloud details if necessary.

## Running the Application

### Development (Hot-Reload)

Start both the backend server and frontend development server with a single command:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

This will:

- Start the Python backend on port 8000.
- Start the Vite frontend dev server (usually port 5173).
- Enable `DEV_MODE` (bypassing Redis/ReCAPTCHA).
- Allow you to access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production Build

To serve the built frontend via the Python server:

1.  **Build**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Run Server**:
    ```bash
    python3 server/main.py
    ```
3.  Access at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 🚀 One-Click Production Deployment

The fastest way to get the app running in production is using Google Cloud Run:

1.  **Click the button below**:
 [![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=unpaidsoc&amp;utm_campaign=FY-Q1-global-cloud-ai-starter-apps&amp;utm_content=immergo-app&amp;utm_term=-)   
2.  **Follow the prompts** in the Google Cloud Shell to authorize and deploy.

### 🛠 Manual Deployment (via `deploy.sh`)

If you prefer to deploy from your terminal, first create your own deployment script from the example:

```bash
cp scripts/example.deploy.sh scripts/deploy.sh
```

Edit `scripts/deploy.sh` with your project details, then run:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Advanced Configuration

To enable production features like metrics, bot protection, and scalable rate limiting, configure the following environment variables (defined in `server/simple_tracker.py` and `server/main.py`):

#### 1. BigQuery Metrics

To track session start and page view events in BigQuery:

- `BQ_DATASET`: Your BigQuery Dataset ID.
- `BQ_TABLE`: Your BigQuery Table ID.
- `DEMO_NAME`: (Optional) Name to identify this app in the metrics (default: `your-app-name`).

#### 2. reCAPTCHA v3

To protect against bots:

- `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`: Your Google reCAPTCHA v3 site key.
  - _Note: Ensure your Cloud Run URL is added to the allowed domains in the reCAPTCHA console._

#### 3. Redis (Rate Limiting)

For scalable rate limiting across multiple container instances:

- `REDIS_URL`: The URL of your Redis instance (e.g., `redis://10.0.0.1:6379/0`).
  - _Note: If using Memorystore for Redis, ensure your Cloud Run service is connected to the same VPC network._

## 🏃‍♂️ Get Started with Vibe-Coding in Google Antigravity

Build your own features, scenarios, or UI components in seconds using **Google Antigravity**. Whether you want to add a &quot;Space Travel&quot; mission or a new &quot;Translator HUD,&quot; here is how to vibe-code your vision:

### 1. Open the Repository in Antigravity

Launch the workspace and point Antigravity to this folder. It will automatically ingest the `GEMINI.md` context file to understand the architecture.

### 2. Describe Your Vibe

Instead of writing boilerplate, just describe the feature you want.

- _&quot;Add a new mission called &#039;Mars Colony Arrival&#039; where the AI acts as a customs officer.&quot;_
- _&quot;Make the splash screen heading pulse with a holographic glow.&quot;_
- _&quot;Add a &#039;Voice Select&#039; dropdown to the HUD so I can pick Gemini&#039;s personality.&quot;_

### 3. Iterate via Live Preview

Use the `./scripts/dev.sh` hot-reloading server. As Antigravity writes the code, you&#039;ll see the UI update instantly. Tell it to _&quot;make the buttons more glassmorphic&quot;_ or _&quot;shift the layout down for better balance&quot;_ until it feels just right.

### 4. Deploy Your Build

Once you&#039;re happy with your changes, use the **One-Click Deployment** or use Antigravity&#039;s terminal to run `./scripts/deploy.sh` to push your build directly to Google Cloud Run.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

Remember that each data has its own trade-offs. And you need to pay attention more to why you&#039;re choosing a certain data structure than to how to implement it.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

### Algorithms by Paradigm

An algorithmic paradigm is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class
of algorithms. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an
algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program.

  * `A` [Regular Expression Matching](src/algorithms/string/regular-expression-matching)
* **Backtracking** - similarly to brute force, try to generate all possible solutions, but each time you generate the next solution, you test
if it satisfies all conditions and only then continue generating subsequent solutions. Otherwise, backtrack and go on a
different path to finding a solution. Normally the DFS traversal of state-space is being used.
  * `B` [Jump Game](src/algorithms/uncategorized/jump-game)

  * `A` [Combination Sum](src/algorithms/sets/combination-sum) - find all combinations that form specific sum
* **Branch &amp; Bound** - remember the lowest-cost solution found at each stage of the backtracking
search, and use the cost of the lowest-cost solution found so far as a lower bound on the cost of
a least-cost solution to the problem in order to discard partial solutions with costs larger than the
lowest-cost solution found so far. Normally, BFS traversal in combination with DFS traversal of state-space
tree is being used.

&gt; Version 5 – the iconic SVG, font, and CSS framework

The internet&#039;s most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from
scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.

### Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?

Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don&#039;t plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.

Documentation is still available but it&#039;s moved to
[https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0) and
[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

&lt;/div&gt;

[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) is a comprehensive library of React components that features our independent implementation of Google&#039;s [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/design/introduction/) system.
It&#039;s trusted by some of the world&#039;s greatest product teams because it&#039;s been rigorously battle-tested through more than a decade of development by thousands of open-source contributors.

Material UI&#039;s core functionality is extended by [MUI X](https://github.com/mui/mui-x), a suite of complex components for advanced use cases.

## Documentation

## Joy UI

This repository also contains Joy UI, an experimental component library that implements our own in-house Joy Design.
Joy UI is in beta and _development is currently on hold_.
When starting a new project from scratch, we recommend Material UI over Joy UI because we can guarantee ongoing support.

Keep in mind that the maintainers are primarily focused on other projects and may not be able to respond in a timely manner to issues or pull requests related to Joy UI.

View the [Joy UI documentation](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/).
