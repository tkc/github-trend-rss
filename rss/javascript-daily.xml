## Community Edition

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. We run a hosted version at [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com), but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.

## Enterprise

If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises). It also includes more features for security (SSO with LDAP or SAML), administration and collaboration (e.g. tracked changes). [Find out more!](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises)

## Keeping up to date

Sign up to the [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/overleaf.com/community-edition-and-server-pro) to get updates on Overleaf releases and development.

## Installation

We have detailed installation instructions in the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/).

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Overleaf, please see the [Release Notes section on the Wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki#release-notes) for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.

## Overleaf Docker Image

This repo contains two dockerfiles, [`Dockerfile-base`](server-ce/Dockerfile-base), which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex-base` image, and [`Dockerfile`](server-ce/Dockerfile) which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex` (or &quot;community&quot;) image.

The Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like `wget`, plus `texlive`.
We split this out because it&#039;s a pretty heavy set of
dependencies, and it&#039;s nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time.

The `sharelatex/sharelatex` image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code
and services.

Use `make build-base` and `make build-community` from `server-ce/` to build these images.

We use the [Phusion base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)
(which is extended by our `base` image) to provide us with a VM-like container
in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the `runit` service
manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the `server-ce/runit`
folder.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; ℹ️ **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected
&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

&gt; contract for a blockchain messenger. The objective is to save messages on the
&gt; blockchain, making them readable (public) to everyone, writable (private) only
&gt; to the person who deployed the contract, and to count how many times the
&gt; message was updated. Develop a Solidity smart contract for this purpose,
&gt; including the necessary functions and considerations for achieving the
&gt; specified goals. Please provide the code and any relevant explanations to

            <h2>README</h2><pre># [React](https://react.dev/) &amp;middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) [![(Runtime) Build and Test](https://github.com/facebook/react/actions/workflows/runtime_build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/react/actions/workflows/runtime_build_and_test.yml) [![(Compiler) TypeScript](https://github.com/facebook/react/actions/workflows/compiler_typescript.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/facebook/react/actions/workflows/compiler_typescript.yml) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html#your-first-pull-request)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don&#039;t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

[Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn).

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.
* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you&#039;re looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).

Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
* [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
* [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)
* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)
* [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)
* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Advanced Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)
* [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)
* [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community)
* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from &#039;react-dom/client&#039;;

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(&#039;container&#039;));
root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name=&quot;Taylor&quot; /&gt;);
```

This example will render &quot;Hello Taylor&quot; into a container on the page.

You&#039;ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.

最全的中华古典文集数据库，包含 5.5 万首唐诗、26 万首宋诗、2.1 万首宋词和其他古典文集。诗人包括唐宋两朝近 1.4 万古诗人，和两宋时期 1.5 千古词人。数据来源于互联网。

**为什么要做这个仓库?** 古诗是中华民族乃至全世界的瑰宝，我们应该传承下去，虽然有古典文集，但大多数人并没有拥有这些书籍。从某种意义上来说，这些庞大的文集离我们是有一定距离的。而电子版方便拷贝，所以此开源数据库诞生了。此数据库通过 JSON 格式分发，可以让你很方便的开始你的项目。

古诗采集没有记录过程，因为古诗数据庞大，目标网站有限制，采集过程经常中断超过了一个星期。2017 年新加入全宋词，[全宋词爬取过程及数据分析](https://jackeygao.github.io/r/words/crawl-ci.html)。

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.

## Contributing

PDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors. To

Feel free to stop by our [Matrix room](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#pdfjs:mozilla.org) for questions or guidance.

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the &quot;Modern browsers&quot; version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools &gt; Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.

For an introduction to the PDF.js code, check out the presentation by our
contributor Julian Viereck:

#### *The Cyber Swiss Army Knife*

CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of &quot;cyber&quot; operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.

The tool is designed to enable both technical and non-technical analysts to manipulate data in complex ways without having to deal with complex tools or algorithms. It was conceived, designed, built and incrementally improved by an analyst in their 10% innovation time over several years.

## Live demo

CyberChef is still under active development. As a result, it shouldn&#039;t be considered a finished product. There is still testing and bug fixing to do, new features to be added and additional documentation to write. Please contribute!

Cryptographic operations in CyberChef should not be relied upon to provide security in any situation. No guarantee is offered for their correctness.

[A live demo can be found here][1] - have fun!

## Containers

If you would like to try out CyberChef locally you can either build it yourself:

```bash
docker build --tag cyberchef --ulimit nofile=10000 .
docker run -it -p 8080:80 cyberchef
```

Or you can use our image directly:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/gchq/cyberchef:latest
```

This image is built and published through our [GitHub Workflows](.github/workflows/releases.yml)

## How it works

There are four main areas in CyberChef:

 1. The **input** box in the top right, where you can paste, type or drag the text or file you want to operate on.
 2. The **output** box in the bottom right, where the outcome of your processing will be displayed.
 3. The **operations** list on the far left, where you can find all the operations that CyberChef is capable of in categorised lists, or by searching.
 4. The **recipe** area in the middle, where you can drag the operations that you want to use and specify arguments and options.

You can use as many operations as you like in simple or complex ways. Some examples are as follows:

 - [Decode a Base64-encoded string][2]
 - [Convert a date and time to a different time zone][3]
 - [Parse a Teredo IPv6 address][4]
 - [Convert data from a hexdump, then decompress][5]
 - [Decrypt and disassemble shellcode][6]
 - [Display multiple timestamps as full dates][7]
 - [Carry out different operations on data of different types][8]
 - [Use parts of the input as arguments to operations][9]
 - [Perform AES decryption, extracting the IV from the beginning of the cipher stream][10]
 - [Automagically detect several layers of nested encoding][12]


## Features

 - Drag and drop
     - Operations can be dragged in and out of the recipe list, or reorganised.
     - Files up to 2GB can be dragged over the input box to load them directly into the browser.
 - Auto Bake
     - Whenever you modify the input or the recipe, CyberChef will automatically &quot;bake&quot; for you and produce the output immediately.
     - This can be turned off and operated manually if it is affecting performance (if the input is very large, for instance).
 - Automated encoding detection
     - CyberChef uses [a number of techniques](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/wiki/Automatic-detection-of-encoded-data-using-CyberChef-Magic) to attempt to automatically detect which encodings your data is under. If it finds a suitable operation that make sense of your data, it displays the &#039;magic&#039; icon in the Output field which you can click to decode your data.
 - Breakpoints
     - You can set breakpoints on any operation in your recipe to pause execution before running it.
     - You can also step through the recipe one operation at a time to see what the data looks like at each stage.
 - Save and load recipes
     - If you come up with an awesome recipe that you know you’ll want to use again, just click &quot;Save recipe&quot; and add it to your local storage. It&#039;ll be waiting for you next time you visit CyberChef.
     - You can also copy the URL, which includes your recipe and input, to easily share it with others.
 - Search
     - If you know the name of the operation you want or a word associated with it, start typing it into the search field and any matching operations will immediately be shown.
 - Highlighting
     - When you highlight text in the input or output, the offset and length values will be displayed and, if possible, the corresponding data will be highlighted in the output or input respectively (example: [highlight the word &#039;question&#039; in the input to see where it appears in the output][11]).
 - Save to file and load from file
     - You can save the output to a file at any time or load a file by dragging and dropping it into the input field. Files up to around 2GB are supported (depending on your browser), however, some operations may take a very long time to run over this much data.
 - CyberChef is entirely client-side
     - It should be noted that none of your recipe configuration or input (either text or files) is ever sent to the CyberChef web server - all processing is carried out within your browser, on your own computer.
     - Due to this feature, CyberChef can be downloaded and run locally. You can use the link in the top left corner of the app to download a full copy of CyberChef and drop it into a virtual machine, share it with other people, or host it in a closed network.


## Deep linking

By manipulating CyberChef&#039;s URL hash, you can change the initial settings with which the page opens.
The format is `https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Operation()&amp;input=...`

Supported arguments are `recipe`, `input` (encoded in Base64), and `theme`.


## Browser support

CyberChef is built to support

 - Google Chrome 50+
 - Mozilla Firefox 38+


## Node.js support

CyberChef is built to fully support Node.js `v16`. For more information, see the [&quot;Node API&quot; wiki page](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/wiki/Node-API)


## Contributing

Contributing a new operation to CyberChef is super easy! The quickstart script will walk you through the process. If you can write basic JavaScript, you can write a CyberChef operation.

An installation walkthrough, how-to guides for adding new operations and themes, descriptions of the repository structure, available data types and coding conventions can all be found in the [&quot;Contributing&quot; wiki page](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/wiki/Contributing).

            <h2>README</h2><pre>About
----- 

**drawio-desktop** is a diagramming desktop app based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that wraps the [core draw.io editor](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).

Download built binaries from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).

**Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don&#039;t change the code and accept it is provided &quot;as-is&quot;, you can use it for any purpose.

Security
--------

draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.

No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. This means certain functionality for which we do not have a JavaScript implementation do not work in the Desktop build, namely .vsd and Gliffy import.

Security and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no.

Support
-------

Support is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support for non-paying users.

Purchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop, unless you have a paid advanced (premium) edition of draw.io for Confluence Cloud.

Developing
----------

**draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.git`

To run this:
1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo)
2. export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode.
3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`.

Note: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also.

To release:
1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin.
2. Wait for the builds to complete (https://travis-ci.org/jgraph/drawio-desktop and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidjgraph/drawio-desktop)
3. Go to https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases, edit the preview release.
4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr http://rfc3161timestamp.globalsign.com/advanced /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe`
5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe`
6. Add release notes
7. Publish release

*Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them.

Local Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io`
- Windows: `C:\Users\&lt;USER-NAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\draw.io\`

Not open-contribution
---------------------

draw.io is closed to contributions (unless a maintainer permits it, which is extremely rare).

The level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes 
can break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required 
is far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we&#039;d have 
to basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented.

We are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, &amp; feature requests. We do
not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we&#039;ve
made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for 
the long term viability of the project.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Odin Project Curriculum

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. Our curriculum is divided into distinct courses, each covering the subject language in depth. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give users the opportunity to practice what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed projects may then be included in the user&#039;s portfolio.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repo contains the actual lesson files used on our website. For the actual TOP app that pulls in this lesson content and contains our front-end and back-end code, please go to the [main TOP repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).

Our community can be found on the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB).

## Contributing

The Odin Project depends on open-source contributions to improve, grow, and thrive.

&lt;br/&gt;

### Getting Started

Install with NPM:
```bash
npm install sortablejs --save
```

Install with Bower:
```bash
bower install --save sortablejs
```

Import into your project:
```js
// Default SortableJS
import Sortable from &#039;sortablejs&#039;;

// Core SortableJS (without default plugins)
import Sortable from &#039;sortablejs/modular/sortable.core.esm.js&#039;;

// Complete SortableJS (with all plugins)
import Sortable from &#039;sortablejs/modular/sortable.complete.esm.js&#039;;
```

Cherrypick plugins:
```js
// Cherrypick extra plugins
import Sortable, { MultiDrag, Swap } from &#039;sortablejs&#039;;

Sortable.mount(new MultiDrag(), new Swap());


// Cherrypick default plugins
import Sortable, { AutoScroll } from &#039;sortablejs/modular/sortable.core.esm.js&#039;;

Sortable.mount(new AutoScroll());
```


---


### Usage
```html
&lt;ul id=&quot;items&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;item 2&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

```js
var el = document.getElementById(&#039;items&#039;);
var sortable = Sortable.create(el);
```

You can use any element for the list and its elements, not just `ul`/`li`. Here is an [example with `div`s](https://jsbin.com/visimub/edit?html,js,output).

});
```

#### `group` option
To drag elements from one list into another, both lists must have the same `group` value.
You can also define whether lists can give away, give and keep a copy (`clone`), and receive elements.

 * name: `String` — group name
 * pull: `true|false|[&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]|&#039;clone&#039;|function` — ability to move from the list. `clone` — copy the item, rather than move. Or an array of group names which the elements may be put in. Defaults to `true`.
 * put: `true|false|[&quot;baz&quot;, &quot;qux&quot;]|function` — whether elements can be added from other lists, or an array of group names from which elements can be added.
 * revertClone: `boolean` — revert cloned element to initial position after moving to a another list.


Demo:
 - https://jsbin.com/hijetos/edit?js,output
 - https://jsbin.com/nacoyah/edit?js,output — use of complex logic in the `pull` and` put`
 - https://jsbin.com/bifuyab/edit?js,output — use `revertClone: true`


---


#### `sort` option
Allow sorting inside list.

Demo: https://jsbin.com/jayedig/edit?js,output


---


#### `delay` option
Time in milliseconds to define when the sorting should start.
Unfortunately, due to browser restrictions, delaying is not possible on IE or Edge with native drag &amp; drop.

Demo: https://jsbin.com/zosiwah/edit?js,output


---


#### `delayOnTouchOnly` option
Whether or not the delay should be applied only if the user is using touch (eg. on a mobile device). No delay will be applied in any other case. Defaults to `false`.


---


#### `swapThreshold` option
Percentage of the target that the swap zone will take up, as a float between `0` and `1`.

[Read more](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable/wiki/Swap-Thresholds-and-Direction#swap-threshold)

Demo: http://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable#thresholds


---


#### `invertSwap` option
Set to `true` to set the swap zone to the sides of the target, for the effect of sorting &quot;in between&quot; items.

[Read more](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable/wiki/Swap-Thresholds-and-Direction#forcing-inverted-swap-zone)

Demo: http://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable#thresholds


---


#### `invertedSwapThreshold` option
Percentage of the target that the inverted swap zone will take up, as a float between `0` and `1`. If not given, will default to `swapThreshold`.

[Read more](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable/wiki/Swap-Thresholds-and-Direction#dealing-with-swap-glitching)


---


#### `direction` option
Direction that the Sortable should sort in. Can be set to `&#039;vertical&#039;`, `&#039;horizontal&#039;`, or a function, which will be called whenever a target is dragged over. Must return `&#039;vertical&#039;` or `&#039;horizontal&#039;`.

[Read more](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable/wiki/Swap-Thresholds-and-Direction#direction)


Example of direction detection for vertical list that includes full column and half column elements:

```js
Sortable.create(el, {
	direction: function(evt, target, dragEl) {
		if (target !== null &amp;&amp; target.className.includes(&#039;half-column&#039;) &amp;&amp; dragEl.className.includes(&#039;half-column&#039;)) {
			return &#039;horizontal&#039;;
		}
		return &#039;vertical&#039;;
	}
});
```


---


#### `touchStartThreshold` option
This option is similar to `fallbackTolerance` option.

When the `delay` option is set, some phones with very sensitive touch displays like the Samsung Galaxy S8 will fire
unwanted touchmove events even when your finger is not moving, resulting in the sort not triggering.

This option sets the minimum pointer movement that must occur before the delayed sorting is cancelled.

Values between 3 to 5 are good.


---


#### `disabled` options
Disables the sortable if set to `true`.

Demo: https://jsbin.com/sewokud/edit?js,output

```js
var sortable = Sortable.create(list);

document.getElementById(&quot;switcher&quot;).onclick = function () {
	var state = sortable.option(&quot;disabled&quot;); // get

	sortable.option(&quot;disabled&quot;, !state); // set
};
```


---


#### `handle` option
To make list items draggable, Sortable disables text selection by the user.
That&#039;s not always desirable. To allow text selection, define a drag handler,
which is an area of every list element that allows it to be dragged around.

Demo: https://jsbin.com/numakuh/edit?html,js,output

```js
Sortable.create(el, {
	handle: &quot;.my-handle&quot;
});
```

```html
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;my-handle&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; list item text one
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;my-handle&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; list item text two
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

```css
.my-handle {
	cursor: move;
	cursor: -webkit-grabbing;
}
```


---


#### `filter` option


```js
Sortable.create(list, {
	filter: &quot;.js-remove, .js-edit&quot;,
	onFilter: function (evt) {
		var item = evt.item,
			ctrl = evt.target;

		if (Sortable.utils.is(ctrl, &quot;.js-remove&quot;)) {  // Click on remove button
			item.parentNode.removeChild(item); // remove sortable item
		}
		else if (Sortable.utils.is(ctrl, &quot;.js-edit&quot;)) {  // Click on edit link
			// ...
		}
	}
})
```


---


#### `ghostClass` option
Class name for the drop placeholder (default `sortable-ghost`).

Demo: https://jsbin.com/henuyiw/edit?css,js,output

```css
.ghost {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
```

```js
Sortable.create(list, {
  ghostClass: &quot;ghost&quot;
});
```


---


#### `chosenClass` option
Class name for the chosen item  (default `sortable-chosen`).

Demo: https://jsbin.com/hoqufox/edit?css,js,output

```css
.chosen {
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #c00;
}
```

```js
Sortable.create(list, {
  delay: 500,
  chosenClass: &quot;chosen&quot;
});
```


---


#### `forceFallback` option
If set to `true`, the Fallback for non HTML5 Browser will be used, even if we are using an HTML5 Browser.
This gives us the possibility to test the behaviour for older Browsers even in newer Browser, or make the Drag &#039;n Drop feel more consistent between Desktop , Mobile and old Browsers.

On top of that, the Fallback always generates a copy of that DOM Element and appends the class `fallbackClass` defined in the options. This behaviour controls the look of this &#039;dragged&#039; Element.

Demo: https://jsbin.com/sibiput/edit?html,css,js,output


---


#### `fallbackTolerance` option
Emulates the native drag threshold. Specify in pixels how far the mouse should move before it&#039;s considered as a drag.
Useful if the items are also clickable like in a list of links.

When the user clicks inside a sortable element, it&#039;s not uncommon for your hand to move a little between the time you press and the time you release.
Dragging only starts if you move the pointer past a certain tolerance, so that you don&#039;t accidentally start dragging every time you click.

3 to 5 are probably good values.


---


#### `dragoverBubble` option
If set to `true`, the dragover event will bubble to parent sortables. Works on both fallback and native dragover event.
By default, it is false, but Sortable will only stop bubbling the event once the element has been inserted into a parent Sortable, or *can* be inserted into a parent Sortable, but isn&#039;t at that specific time (due to animation, etc).

Since 1.8.0, you will probably want to leave this option as false. Before 1.8.0, it may need to be `true` for nested sortables to work.


---


#### `removeCloneOnHide` option
If set to `false`, the clone is hidden by having it&#039;s CSS `display` property set to `none`.
By default, this option is `true`, meaning Sortable will remove the cloned element from the DOM when it is supposed to be hidden.


---


#### `emptyInsertThreshold` option
The distance (in pixels) the mouse must be from an empty sortable while dragging for the drag element to be inserted into that sortable. Defaults to `5`. Set to `0` to disable this feature.

Demo: https://jsbin.com/becavoj/edit?js,output

An alternative to this option would be to set a padding on your list when it is empty.

For example:
```css
ul:empty {
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
```

Warning: For `:empty` to work, it must have no node inside (even text one).

Demo:
https://jsbin.com/yunakeg/edit?html,css,js,output

### Event object ([demo](https://jsbin.com/fogujiv/edit?js,output))

 - to:`HTMLElement` — list, in which moved element
 - from:`HTMLElement` — previous list
 - item:`HTMLElement` — dragged element
 - clone:`HTMLElement`
 - oldIndex:`Number|undefined` — old index within parent
 - newIndex:`Number|undefined` — new index within parent
 - oldDraggableIndex: `Number|undefined` — old index within parent, only counting draggable elements
 - newDraggableIndex: `Number|undefined` — new index within parent, only counting draggable elements
 - pullMode:`String|Boolean|undefined` — Pull mode if dragging into another sortable (`&quot;clone&quot;`, `true`, or `false`), otherwise undefined


#### `move` event object
 - to:`HTMLElement`
 - from:`HTMLElement`
 - dragged:`HTMLElement`
 - draggedRect:`DOMRect`
 - related:`HTMLElement` — element on which have guided
 - relatedRect:`DOMRect`
 - willInsertAfter:`Boolean` — `true` if will element be inserted after target (or `false` if before)


---


### Methods


##### option(name:`String`[, value:`*`]):`*`
Get or set the option.



##### closest(el:`HTMLElement`[, selector:`String`]):`HTMLElement|null`
For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.


##### toArray():`String[]`
Serializes the sortable&#039;s item `data-id`&#039;s (`dataIdAttr` option) into an array of string.


##### sort(order:`String[]`, useAnimation:`Boolean`)
Sorts the elements according to the array.

```js
var order = sortable.toArray();
sortable.sort(order.reverse(), true); // apply
```


##### save()
Save the current sorting (see [store](#store))


##### destroy()
Removes the sortable functionality completely.


---


&lt;a name=&quot;store&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### Store
Saving and restoring of the sort.

```html
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li data-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;order&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li data-id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;save&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li data-id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;restore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

```js
Sortable.create(el, {
	group: &quot;localStorage-example&quot;,
	store: {
		/**
		 * Get the order of elements. Called once during initialization.
		 * @param   {Sortable}  sortable
		 * @returns {Array}
		 */
		get: function (sortable) {
			var order = localStorage.getItem(sortable.options.group.name);
			return order ? order.split(&#039;|&#039;) : [];
		},

		/**
		 * Save the order of elements. Called onEnd (when the item is dropped).
		 * @param {Sortable}  sortable
		 */
		set: function (sortable) {
			var order = sortable.toArray();
			localStorage.setItem(sortable.options.group.name, order.join(&#039;|&#039;));
		}
	}
})
```

## What is Label Studio?

&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

## Try out Label Studio

Install Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. Also you can try [Label Studio Teams](https://app.heartex.com).

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python &gt;=3.7 &lt;=3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you&#039;ve made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you&#039;re using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you&#039;re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

#### Run test suite
```bash
pip install -r deploy/requirements-test.txt
cd label_studio

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass)
DJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto
```


## What you get from Label Studio

![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it&#039;s tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/templates-categories.jpg&quot; /&gt;

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).

[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.

to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.
