            <h2>README</h2><pre># Claudesidian: Claude Code + Obsidian Starter Kit

Turn your Obsidian vault into an AI-powered second brain using Claude Code.

## What is this?

This is a pre-configured Obsidian vault structure designed to work seamlessly
with Claude Code, enabling you to:

- Use AI as a thinking partner, not just a writing assistant
- Organize knowledge using the PARA method
- Maintain version control with Git
- Access your vault from anywhere (including mobile)

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the Starter Kit

**Option A: Clone with Git**

```bash
# Clone with your preferred folder name (replace &#039;my-vault&#039; with any name you like)
git clone https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian.git my-vault
cd my-vault

# Examples:
# git clone https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian.git obsidian-notes
# git clone https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian.git knowledge-base
# git clone https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian.git second-brain
```

**Option B: Download ZIP (no Git required)**

1. Click &quot;Code&quot; → &quot;Download ZIP&quot; on GitHub
2. Extract to your desired location
3. Open the folder in Claude Code

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
# Start Claude Code in the directory
claude

# Run the interactive setup wizard (in Claude Code)
/init-bootstrap
```

This will:

- Install dependencies automatically
- Disconnect from the original claudesidian repository
- **Intelligently analyze** your existing vault structure and patterns
- **Import your existing Obsidian vault** safely to OLD_VAULT/ (if you have one)
- **Research your public work** for personalized context (with your permission)
- Ask you about your workflow preferences
- Create a personalized CLAUDE.md configuration
- Set up your folder structure
- Optionally configure Gemini Vision for image/video analysis
- Optionally configure Firecrawl for web research
- Initialize Git for version control

### 3. Open in Obsidian (Optional but Recommended)

- Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- Open vault from the claudesidian folder
- This gives you a visual interface alongside Claude Code

### 4. Your First Session

Tell Claude Code:

```
I&#039;m starting a new project about [topic].
I&#039;m in thinking mode, not writing mode.
Please search my vault for any relevant existing notes,
then help me explore this topic by asking questions.
```

Or use one of the pre-configured commands (in Claude Code):

```
/thinking-partner   # For collaborative exploration
/daily-review       # For end-of-day reflection
/research-assistant # For deep dives into topics
```

## Folder Structure

```
claudesidian/
├── 00_Inbox/           # Temporary capture point for new ideas
├── 01_Projects/        # Active, time-bound initiatives
├── 02_Areas/           # Ongoing responsibilities
├── 03_Resources/       # Reference materials and knowledge base
├── 04_Archive/         # Completed projects and inactive items
├── 05_Attachments/     # Images, PDFs, and other files
├── 06_Metadata/        # Vault configuration and templates
│   ├── Reference/      # Documentation and guides
│   └── Templates/      # Reusable note templates
└── .scripts/           # Helper scripts for automation
```

## Key Concepts

### Thinking Mode vs Writing Mode

**Thinking Mode** (Research &amp; Exploration):

- Claude asks questions to understand your goals
- Searches existing notes for relevant content
- Helps make connections between ideas
- Maintains a log of insights and progress

**Writing Mode** (Content Creation):

- Generates drafts based on your research
- Helps structure and edit content
- Creates final deliverables

### The PARA Method

**Projects**: Have a deadline and specific outcome

- Example: &quot;Q4 2025 Marketing Strategy&quot;
- Create a folder in `01_Projects/`

**Areas**: Ongoing without an end date

- Example: &quot;Health&quot;, &quot;Finances&quot;, &quot;Team Management&quot;
- Lives in `02_Areas/`

**Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest

- Example: &quot;AI Research&quot;, &quot;Writing Tips&quot;
- Store in `03_Resources/`

**Archive**: Inactive items

- Completed projects with their outputs
- Old notes no longer relevant

## Claude Code Commands

Pre-configured AI assistants ready to use:

- `thinking-partner` - Explore ideas through questions
- `inbox-processor` - Organize your captures
- `research-assistant` - Deep dive into topics
- `daily-review` - End of day reflection
- `weekly-synthesis` - Find patterns in your week
- `create-command` - Build new custom commands
- `de-ai-ify` - Remove AI writing patterns from text
- `upgrade` - Update to the latest claudesidian version
- `init-bootstrap` - Re-run the setup wizard
- `install-claudesidian-command` - Install shell command to launch vault from
  anywhere

Run with: `/[command-name]` in Claude Code

### Staying Updated with `/upgrade`

Claudesidian automatically checks for updates when you start Claude Code and
will remind you to run `/upgrade` when new features are available.

The upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your
customizations:

```bash
# Preview what would be updated (recommended first)
/upgrade check

# Run the interactive upgrade
/upgrade

# Skip confirmations for safe updates (advanced)
/upgrade force
```

**What the upgrade does:**

- Creates a timestamped backup before making any changes
- Shows you diffs for each file before updating
- Preserves your personal notes and customizations
- Only updates system files (commands, agents, scripts)
- Never touches your content folders (00_Inbox, 01_Projects, etc.)
- Provides rollback capability if needed

**Safety features:**

- All your personal content is protected
- Complete backup created in `.backup/upgrade-[timestamp]/`
- File-by-file review and confirmation
- Progress tracked in `.upgrade-checklist.md`
- Can be stopped and resumed at any time

## Vision &amp; Document Analysis (Optional)

With [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) MCP configured, Claude Code can
process your attachments directly without having to describe them. This means:

- **Direct image analysis**: Claude sees the actual image, not your description
- **PDF text extraction**: Full document text without copy-pasting
- **Bulk processing**: Analyze multiple screenshots or documents at once
- **Smart organization**: Auto-generate filenames based on image content
- **Comparison tasks**: Compare before/after screenshots, designs, etc.

**Why this matters**: Instead of describing &quot;a screenshot showing an error
message&quot;, Claude Code directly sees and reads the error. Perfect for debugging
UI issues, analyzing charts, or processing scanned documents.

**Getting a Gemini API key:**

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click &quot;Get API key&quot; in the left sidebar
4. Create a new API key (it&#039;s free!)
5. Set it in your environment: `export GEMINI_API_KEY=&quot;your-key-here&quot;`

See `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full setup instructions

## Web Research (Optional)

With [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) configured, our helper scripts
fetch and save full web content directly to your vault. This means:

- **Full text capture**: Scripts pipe complete article text to files, not
  summaries
- **Context preservation**: Claude doesn&#039;t need to hold web content in memory
- **Batch processing**: Save multiple articles at once with `firecrawl-batch.sh`
- **Clean markdown**: Web pages converted to readable, searchable markdown
- **Permanent archive**: Your research stays in your vault forever

**Why this matters**: Instead of Claude reading a webpage and summarizing it
(losing detail), the scripts save the FULL text. Claude can then search and
analyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for
research projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Save a single article
npm run firecrawl:scrape -- &quot;https://example.com/article&quot; &quot;03_Resources/Articles&quot;

# Batch save multiple URLs
npm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt &quot;03_Resources/Research&quot;
```

**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**

1. Visit [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) and sign up
2. Get 300 free credits to start (open-source, can self-host)
3. Go to your dashboard to find your API key
4. Copy the key (format: `fc-xxxxx...`)
5. Set it in your environment: `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=&quot;fc-your-key-here&quot;`

## Helper Scripts

Run these with `pnpm`:

- `attachments:list` - Show unprocessed attachments
- `attachments:organized` - Count organized files
- `attachments:sizes` - Find large files
- `attachments:orphans` - Find unreferenced attachments
- `vault:stats` - Show vault statistics

## Advanced Setup

### Quick Launch from Anywhere

Install a shell command to launch your vault from any directory:

```bash
# In Claude Code, run:
/install-claudesidian-command
```

This creates a `claudesidian` alias that:

- Changes to your vault directory automatically
- Tries to resume your existing session (if one exists)
- Falls back to starting a new session
- Returns to your original directory when done

**Usage:**

```bash
# From anywhere in your terminal:
claudesidian

# It will automatically resume your last session or start a new one
```

The command is added to your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.) so it
persists across terminal sessions.

### Git Integration

Initialize Git for version control:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m &quot;Initial vault setup&quot;
git remote add origin your-repo-url
git push -u origin main
```

Best practices:

- Commit after each work session
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Pull before starting work

### Mobile Access

1. Set up a small server (mini PC, cloud VPS, or home server)
2. Install Tailscale for secure VPN access
3. Clone your vault to the server
4. Use Termius or similar SSH client on mobile
5. Run Claude Code remotely

### Custom Commands

Create specialized commands by saving instructions in `.claude/commands/`:

**Research Assistant** (`06_Metadata/Agents/research-assistant.md`):

```markdown
You are a research assistant.

- Search the vault for relevant information
- Synthesize findings from multiple sources
- Identify gaps in knowledge
- Suggest areas for further exploration
```

## Tips &amp; Best Practices

### From Experience

1. **Start in thinking mode**: Resist the urge to generate content immediately
2. **Be a token maximalist**: More context = better results
3. **Save everything**: Capture chats, fragments, partial thoughts
4. **Trust but verify**: Always read AI-generated content
5. **Break your flow**: AI helps you resume easily

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code can&#039;t find my notes

- Make sure you&#039;re running Claude Code from the vault root directory
- Check file permissions
- Verify markdown files have `.md` extension

### Git conflicts

- Always pull before starting work
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Use branches for experimental changes

### Attachment management

- Run `npm run attachments:create-organized` to set up folders
- Use helper scripts to find orphaned files
- Keep attachments under 10MB for Git

## Philosophy

This setup is based on key principles:

1. **AI amplifies thinking, not just writing**
2. **Local files = full control**
3. **Structure enables creativity**
4. **Iteration beats perfection**
5. **The goal is insight, not just information**

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! This is a living template that gets
better with everyone&#039;s input.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test your changes** to ensure everything works
5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m &#039;Add amazing feature&#039;`)
6. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you&#039;ve done

### What We&#039;re Looking For

- **New commands**: Useful Claude Code commands for common workflows
- **New agents**: Specialized agents for specific tasks
- **Documentation improvements**: Better explanations, examples, or guides
- **Bug fixes**: Found something broken? Fix it!
- **Workflow templates**: Share your productive workflows
- **Helper scripts**: Automation tools that make vault management easier
- **Integration guides**: Connect Claudesidian with other tools
- **Core updates**: Improvements to the upgrade system, setup wizard, or other
  core features

### Guidelines

- Keep commands focused and single-purpose
- Write clear documentation with examples
- Test thoroughly before submitting
- Follow existing code style and structure
- Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- **AI-generated content is welcome, but you MUST carefully read and review
  everything before submitting** - never submit code you don&#039;t understand

### Getting Updates

When new features are contributed and merged, users can easily get them with:

```bash
/upgrade
```

The upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your
personal customizations, making it easy to benefit from community contributions
without losing your work.

### Questions or Ideas?

- Open an issue to discuss major changes before starting work
- Join discussions in existing issues
- Share your use cases - they help us understand needs better

Remember: best practices emerge from use, not theory. Your real-world experience
makes this better for everyone!

# Functionality

## Infrastructure Lifecycle Management

Meshery manages the configuration, deployment, and operation of your Cloud services and Kubernetes clusters while supporting hundreds of different types of cloud native infrastructure integrations. Meshery supports [300+ integrations](https://meshery.io/integrations).

&lt;!--
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=034nVaQUyME&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Meshery cloud native management&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshery/meshery/master/.github/assets/images/readme/meshmap.gif&quot;  style=&quot;margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:10px;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/cloud-native-integrations.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Meshery Integrations&quot; src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/cloud-native-integrations.png&quot;  style=&quot;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Find infrastructure configuration patterns in Meshery&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/catalog&quot;&gt;catalog of curated design templates&lt;/a&gt; filled with configuration best practices.

### Multiple Kubernetes Clusters and Multiple Clouds

&lt;img src =&quot;https://meshery.io/assets/images/screens/multi-cluster-management.gif&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Meshery provides a single pane of glass to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure, including various cloud providers. Meshery enables consistent configuration, operation, and observability across your entire Kubernetes landscape.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dry-run your deployments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Meshery leverages Kubernetes&#039; built-in dry-run capabilities to allow you to simulate deployments without actually applying the changes to your cluster. This enables you to:

- Validate configurations: Ensure your deployment specifications (e.g., YAML manifests, Helm charts, Meshery Designs) are syntactically correct and will be accepted by the Kubernetes API server.   
- Identify potential issues: Detect errors in your configurations, such as invalid resource definitions, missing fields, or API version mismatches, before they impact your live environment.
- Preview changes: Understand the objects that Kubernetes would create or modify during a real deployment.
- Integrate with CI/CD: Incorporate dry-run as a step in your continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to automate pre-deployment checks and prevent faulty deployments.

By providing this dry-run functionality, Meshery helps you increase the reliability and stability of your Kubernetes deployments by catching potential problems early in the development and deployment process.
&lt;!-- 
Assess your cloud native infrastructure configuration against deployment and operational best practices with Meshery&#039;s configuration validator. Manage your workloads with confidence. Check your Kubernetes configuration for anti-patterns and avoid common pitfalls. --&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

### Visually and collaboratively manage your infrastructure

Using a GitOps-centric approach, visually and collaboratively design and manage your infrastructure and microservices. Meshery intelligently infers the manner in which each resource [interrelates](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/relationships) with each other. Meshery supports a broad variety of built-in relationships between components, which you can use to create your own custom relationships.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;See changes to your infra before you merge&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-snapshot.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;h3&gt;Operate with configuration best practices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assess your configurations against deployment and operational best practices with Meshery&#039;s configuration validator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Control all of your infrastructure with mesheryctl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether managing multiple Meshery deployments, importing designs, discoverying Kubernetes clusters, do so with ease using Meshery CLI in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --&gt;

## Platform Engineering with Meshery&#039;s Extension Points

Extend Meshery as your self-service engineering platform by taking advantage of its [vast set of extensibility features](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), including gRPC adapters, hot-loadable Reactjs packages and Golang plugins, subscriptions on NATS topics, consumable _and_ extendable API interfaces via REST and GraphQL.The great number of extension points in Meshery make it ideal as the foundation of your internal developer platform.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Access the Cloud Native Patterns for Kubernetes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design and manage all of your cloud native infrastructure using the design configurator in Meshery or start from a template using the patterns from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/catalog&quot;&gt;catalog&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/details&gt;

Meshery offers robust capabilities for managing multiple tenants within a shared Kubernetes infrastructure. Meshery provides the tools and integrations necessary to create a secure, isolated, and manageable multi-tenant environments, allowing multiple teams or organizations with granular control over their role-based access controls.

Meshery&#039;s &quot;multi-player&quot; functionality refers to its collaborative features that enable multiple users to interact with and manage cloud native infrastructure simultaneously. This is primarily facilitated through Kanvas, a Meshery extension visual designer and management interface.

## Performance Management

Meshery offers load generation and performance characterization to help you assess and optimize the performance of your applications and infrastructure.

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/performance-metrics.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create and reuse performance profiles for consistent characterization of the configuration of your infrastructure in context of how it performs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt; Manage the performance of your infrastructure and its workloads&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src = &quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-performance.gif&quot;&gt;

Baseline and track your cloud native performance from release to release.

- Use performance profiles to track the historical performance of your workloads.
- Track your application performance from version to version.
- Understand behavioral differences between cloud native network functions.
- Compare performance across infrastructure deployments.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Load Generation and Microservice Performance Characteristization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;picture align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layer5io/layer5/master/src/assets/images/service-mesh-performance/stacked/smp-light-text.svg&quot;  width=&quot;18%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:10px;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

- **Multiple Load Generators:** Meshery supports various load generators, including Fortio, Wrk2, and Nighthawk, allowing users to choose the tool that best suits your needs.
- **Configurable Performance Profiles:** Meshery provides a highly configurable set of load profiles with tunable facets, enabling users to generate TCP, gRPC, and HTTP load. You can customize parameters such as duration, concurrent threads, concurrent generators, and load generator type. 
- **Statistical Analysis:** Meshery performs statistical analysis on the results of performance tests, presenting data in the form of histograms with latency buckets. Understand the distribution of response times and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Comparison of Test Results:** Meshery enables you to compare the difference in request performance (latency and throughput) between independent performance tests. Save your load test configurations as Performance Profiles, making it easy to rerun tests with the same settings and track performance variations over time.
- **Kubernetes Cluster and Workload Metrics:** - Meshery connects to one or more Prometheus servers to gather both cluster and application metrics. Meshery also integrates with Grafana, allowing you to import your existing dashboards and visualize performance data.

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to produce infrastructure agnostic tooling, Meshery uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Performance&lt;/a&gt; specification as a common format to capture and measure your infrastructure&#039;s performance against a universal cloud native performance index. Meshery participates in advancing cloud native infrastructure adoption through the standardization of APIs. Meshery enables you to measure the value provided by Docker, Kubernetes, or other cloud native infrastructure in the context of the overhead incurred.&lt;/p&gt;

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## Install

```bash
npm install markdownlint --save-dev
```

## Overview

The [Markdown][markdown] markup language is designed to be easy to read, write,
and understand. It succeeds - and its flexibility is both a benefit and a
drawback. Many styles are possible, so formatting can be inconsistent; some
constructs don&#039;t work well in all parsers and should be avoided.

`markdownlint` is a [static analysis][static-analysis] tool for
[Node.js][nodejs] with a library of rules to enforce standards and consistency
for Markdown files. It was inspired by - and heavily influenced by - Mark
Harrison&#039;s [markdownlint][markdownlint-ruby] for Ruby. The initial rules, rule
documentation, and test cases came from that project.

`markdownlint` uses the [`micromark` parser][micromark] and honors the
[CommonMark][commonmark] specification for Markdown. It additionally supports
popular [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)][gfm] syntax like autolinks and tables
as well as directives, footnotes, and math syntax - all implemented by
[`micromark` extensions][micromark-extensions].

### Custom Rules

In addition to built-in rules, custom rules can be used to address
project-specific requirements. To find community-developed rules use
[keyword `markdownlint-rule` on npm][markdownlint-rule].
To implement your own rules, refer to [CustomRules.md](doc/CustomRules.md).

## Configuration

Text passed to `markdownlint` is parsed as Markdown, analyzed, and any
issues reported. Two kinds of text are ignored by most rules:

- [HTML comments](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#comments)
- [Front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) (see
  `options.frontMatter` below)

All rules are enabled by default. Rules can be enabled, disabled, and configured
for each call to the `lint` API by passing an `options.config` object (described
below). To enable or disable rules within a file, use one of the following HTML
comments (which are not rendered):

- Disable all rules: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable --&gt;`
- Enable all rules: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable --&gt;`
- Disable all rules for the current line: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-line --&gt;`
- Disable all rules for the next line: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line --&gt;`
- Disable one or more rules by name: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 MD005 --&gt;`
- Enable one or more rules by name: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable MD001 MD005 --&gt;`
- Disable one or more rules by name for the current line:
  `&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD001 MD005 --&gt;`
- Disable one or more rules by name for the next line:
  `&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD001 MD005 --&gt;`
- Capture the current rule configuration: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-capture --&gt;`
- Restore the captured rule configuration: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-restore --&gt;`

For example:

```markdown
&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-space-in-emphasis --&gt;
space * in * emphasis
```

Or:

```markdown
space * in * emphasis &lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-line no-space-in-emphasis --&gt;
```

Or:

```markdown
&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable no-space-in-emphasis --&gt;
space * in * emphasis
&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable no-space-in-emphasis --&gt;
```

To temporarily disable rule(s), then restore the former configuration:

```markdown
&lt;!-- markdownlint-capture --&gt;
&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable --&gt;
any violations you want
&lt;!-- markdownlint-restore --&gt;
```

The initial configuration is captured by default (as if every document
began with `&lt;!-- markdownlint-capture --&gt;`), so the pattern above can
be expressed more simply:

```markdown
&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable --&gt;
any violations you want
&lt;!-- markdownlint-restore --&gt;
```

Changes take effect starting with the line a comment is on, so the following
has no effect:

```markdown
space * in * emphasis &lt;!-- markdownlint-disable --&gt; &lt;!-- markdownlint-enable --&gt;
```

To apply changes to an entire file regardless of where the comment is located,
the following syntax is supported:

- Disable all rules: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-file --&gt;`
- Enable all rules: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable-file --&gt;`
- Disable one or more rules by name: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD001 --&gt;`
- Enable one or more rules by name: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable-file MD001 --&gt;`

This can be used to &quot;hide&quot; `markdownlint` comments at the bottom of a file.

In cases where it is desirable to change the configuration of one or
more rules for a file, the following more advanced syntax is supported:

- Configure: `&lt;!-- markdownlint-configure-file { options.config JSON } --&gt;`

For example:

```markdown
&lt;!-- markdownlint-configure-file { &quot;hr-style&quot;: { &quot;style&quot;: &quot;---&quot; } } --&gt;
```

or

```markdown
&lt;!-- markdownlint-configure-file
{
  &quot;hr-style&quot;: {
    &quot;style&quot;: &quot;---&quot;
  },
  &quot;no-trailing-spaces&quot;: false
}
--&gt;
```

These changes apply to the entire file regardless of where the comment is
located. Multiple such comments (if present) are applied top-to-bottom. By
default, content of `markdownlint-configure-file` is assumed to be JSON, but
[`options.configParsers`](#optionsconfigparsers) can be used to support
alternate formats.

## API

### Linting

Asynchronous API via `import { lint } from &quot;markdownlint/async&quot;`:

```javascript
/**
 * Lint specified Markdown files.
 *
 * @param {Options | null} options Configuration options.
 * @param {LintCallback} callback Callback (err, result) function.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function lint(options, callback) { ... }
```

Synchronous API via `import { lint } from &quot;markdownlint/sync&quot;`:

```javascript
/**
 * Lint specified Markdown files.
 *
 * @param {Options | null} options Configuration options.
 * @returns {LintResults} Results object.
 */
function lint(options) { ... }
```

Promise API via `import { lint } from &quot;markdownlint/promise&quot;`:

```javascript
/**
 * Lint specified Markdown files.
 *
 * @param {Options | null} options Configuration options.
 * @returns {Promise&lt;LintResults&gt;} Results object.
 */
function lint(options) { ... }
```

#### options

Type: `Object`

Configures the function. All properties are optional, but at least one
of `files` or `strings` should be set to provide input.

##### options.config

Type: `Object` mapping `String` to `Boolean | &quot;error&quot; | &quot;warning&quot; | Object`

Configures the rules to use.

Object keys are rule names/aliases; object values are the rule&#039;s configuration.
The value `false` disables a rule. The values `true` or `&quot;error&quot;` enable a rule
in its default configuration and report violations as errors. The value
`&quot;warning&quot;` enables a rule in its default configuration and reports violations
as warnings. Passing an object enables *and* customizes the rule; the properties
`severity` (`&quot;error&quot; | &quot;warning&quot;`) and `enabled` (`false | true`) can be used in
this context. The special `default` rule assigns the default for all rules.
Using a tag name (e.g., `whitespace`) and a setting of `false`, `true`,
`&quot;error&quot;`, or `&quot;warning&quot;` applies that setting to all rules with that tag. When
no configuration object is passed or the optional `default` setting is not
present, all rules are enabled.

The following syntax disables the specified rule, tag, or `default`:

```javascript
{
  &quot;rule_tag_or_default&quot;: false
}
```

The following syntax enables the specified rule, tag, or `default` to report
violations as errors:

```javascript
{
  &quot;rule_tag_or_default&quot;: true
  // OR
  &quot;rule_tag_or_default&quot;: &quot;error&quot;
}
```

The following syntax enables the specified rule, tag, or `default` to report
violations as warnings:

```javascript
{
  &quot;rule_tag_or_default&quot;: &quot;warning&quot;
}
```

The following syntax enables and configures the specified rule to report
violations as errors:

```javascript
{
  &quot;rule&quot;: {
    &quot;severity&quot;: &quot;error&quot;
  }
  // OR
  &quot;rule&quot;: {
    &quot;rule_parameter&quot;: &quot;value&quot;
  }
  // OR
  &quot;rule&quot;: {
    &quot;severity&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
    &quot;rule_parameter&quot;: &quot;value&quot;
  }
}
```

The following syntax enables and configures the specified rule to report
violations as warnings:

```javascript
{
  &quot;rule&quot;: {
    &quot;severity&quot;: &quot;warning&quot;
  }
  // OR
  &quot;rule&quot;: {
    &quot;severity&quot;: &quot;warning&quot;,
    &quot;rule_parameter&quot;: &quot;value&quot;
  }
}
```

&gt; Note that values `&quot;error&quot;` and `&quot;warning&quot;` and the property `severity` are not
&gt; supported by library versions earlier than `0.39.0`. However, the examples
&gt; above behave the same there, with warnings being reported as errors.

The following syntax disables and configures the specified rule:

```javascript
{
  &quot;rule&quot;: {
    &quot;enabled&quot;: false,
    &quot;rule_parameter&quot;: &quot;value&quot;
  }
  // OR
  &quot;rule&quot;: {
    &quot;enabled&quot;: false,
    &quot;severity&quot;: &quot;warning&quot;,
    &quot;rule_parameter&quot;: &quot;value&quot;
  }
}
```

&gt; Note that this example behaves **differently** with library versions earlier
&gt; than `0.39.0` because the property `enabled` is not supported: it **enables**
&gt; the rule instead of **disabling** it. As such, this syntax is discouraged when
&gt; interoperability is important.

To evaluate a configuration object, the `default` setting is applied first, then
keys are processed in order from top to bottom. If multiple values apply to a
rule (because of tag names or duplication), later values override earlier ones.
Keys (including rule names, aliases, tags, or `default`) are not case-sensitive.

Example using `default`, rule names, and tag names together:

```json
{
  &quot;default&quot;: true,
  &quot;MD003&quot;: { &quot;style&quot;: &quot;atx_closed&quot; },
  &quot;MD007&quot;: { &quot;indent&quot;: 4 },
  &quot;no-hard-tabs&quot;: false,
  &quot;whitespace&quot;: false
}
```

See [.markdownlint.jsonc](schema/.markdownlint.jsonc) and/or
[.markdownlint.yaml](schema/.markdownlint.yaml) for an example
configuration object with all properties set to the default value.

Sets of rules (known as a &quot;style&quot;) can be stored separately and loaded
as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

Example of referencing a built-in style from JavaScript:

```javascript
const options = {
  &quot;files&quot;: [ &quot;...&quot; ],
  &quot;config&quot;: require(&quot;style/relaxed.json&quot;)
};
```

Example doing so from `.markdownlint.json` via `extends` (more on this below):

```json
{
  &quot;extends&quot;: &quot;markdownlint/style/relaxed&quot;
}
```

See the [style](style) directory for more samples.

See [markdownlint-config-schema.json](schema/markdownlint-config-schema.json)
for the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) of the `options.config`
object.

See [ValidatingConfiguration.md](schema/ValidatingConfiguration.md) for ways to
use the JSON Schema to validate configuration.

For more advanced scenarios, styles can reference and build upon other styles
via the `extends` keyword and a file path or (installed) package name. The
`readConfig` function can be used to read such aggregate styles from code.

For example, assuming a `base.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  &quot;default&quot;: true
}
```

And a `custom.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  &quot;extends&quot;: &quot;base.json&quot;,
  &quot;line-length&quot;: false
}
```

Then code like the following:

## Introduction

Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.

**TL;DR**

- Bundles [ES Modules](https://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).
- Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
- Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
- Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
- Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

#### Learn about webpack through videos!

- [Understanding Webpack - Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj93pvQIsRo)
- [Understanding Webpack - Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQiJaFzuJ8)

### Get Started

Check out webpack&#039;s quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

### Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
Webpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.

## Concepts

### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)

Webpack has a [rich plugin
interface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features
within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very
**flexible**.

### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)

Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle
**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own
loaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.

Loaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,
or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.

A querystring parsing and stringifying library with some added security.

Lead Maintainer: [Jordan Harband](https://github.com/ljharb)

The **qs** module was originally created and maintained by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring).

## Usage

```javascript
var qs = require(&#039;qs&#039;);
var assert = require(&#039;assert&#039;);

var obj = qs.parse(&#039;a=c&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(obj, { a: &#039;c&#039; });

var str = qs.stringify(obj);
assert.equal(str, &#039;a=c&#039;);
```

### Parsing Objects

[](#preventEval)
```javascript
qs.parse(string, [options]);
```

**qs** allows you to create nested objects within your query strings, by surrounding the name of sub-keys with square brackets `[]`.
For example, the string `&#039;foo[bar]=baz&#039;` converts to:

```javascript
assert.deepEqual(qs.parse(&#039;foo[bar]=baz&#039;), {
    foo: {
        bar: &#039;baz&#039;
    }
});
```

When using the `plainObjects` option the parsed value is returned as a null object, created via `{ __proto__: null }` and as such you should be aware that prototype methods will not exist on it and a user may set those names to whatever value they like:

```javascript
var nullObject = qs.parse(&#039;a[hasOwnProperty]=b&#039;, { plainObjects: true });
assert.deepEqual(nullObject, { a: { hasOwnProperty: &#039;b&#039; } });
```

By default parameters that would overwrite properties on the object prototype are ignored, if you wish to keep the data from those fields either use `plainObjects` as mentioned above, or set `allowPrototypes` to `true` which will allow user input to overwrite those properties.
*WARNING* It is generally a bad idea to enable this option as it can cause problems when attempting to use the properties that have been overwritten.
Always be careful with this option.

```javascript
var protoObject = qs.parse(&#039;a[hasOwnProperty]=b&#039;, { allowPrototypes: true });
assert.deepEqual(protoObject, { a: { hasOwnProperty: &#039;b&#039; } });
```

URI encoded strings work too:

```javascript
assert.deepEqual(qs.parse(&#039;a%5Bb%5D=c&#039;), {
    a: { b: &#039;c&#039; }
});
```

You can also nest your objects, like `&#039;foo[bar][baz]=foobarbaz&#039;`:

```javascript
assert.deepEqual(qs.parse(&#039;foo[bar][baz]=foobarbaz&#039;), {
    foo: {
        bar: {
            baz: &#039;foobarbaz&#039;
        }
    }
});
```

By default, when nesting objects **qs** will only parse up to 5 children deep.
This means if you attempt to parse a string like `&#039;a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j&#039;` your resulting object will be:

```javascript
var expected = {
    a: {
        b: {
            c: {
                d: {
                    e: {
                        f: {
                            &#039;[g][h][i]&#039;: &#039;j&#039;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
var string = &#039;a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j&#039;;
assert.deepEqual(qs.parse(string), expected);
```

This depth can be overridden by passing a `depth` option to `qs.parse(string, [options])`:

```javascript
var deep = qs.parse(&#039;a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j&#039;, { depth: 1 });
assert.deepEqual(deep, { a: { b: { &#039;[c][d][e][f][g][h][i]&#039;: &#039;j&#039; } } });
```

You can configure **qs** to throw an error when parsing nested input beyond this depth using the `strictDepth` option (defaulted to false):

```javascript
try {
    qs.parse(&#039;a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j&#039;, { depth: 1, strictDepth: true });
} catch (err) {
    assert(err instanceof RangeError);
    assert.strictEqual(err.message, &#039;Input depth exceeded depth option of 1 and strictDepth is true&#039;);
}
```

The depth limit helps mitigate abuse when **qs** is used to parse user input, and it is recommended to keep it a reasonably small number. The strictDepth option adds a layer of protection by throwing an error when the limit is exceeded, allowing you to catch and handle such cases.

For similar reasons, by default **qs** will only parse up to 1000 parameters. This can be overridden by passing a `parameterLimit` option:

```javascript
var limited = qs.parse(&#039;a=b&amp;c=d&#039;, { parameterLimit: 1 });
assert.deepEqual(limited, { a: &#039;b&#039; });
```

If you want an error to be thrown whenever the a limit is exceeded (eg, `parameterLimit`, `arrayLimit`), set the `throwOnLimitExceeded` option to `true`. This option will generate a descriptive error if the query string exceeds a configured limit.
```javascript
try {
    qs.parse(&#039;a=1&amp;b=2&amp;c=3&amp;d=4&#039;, { parameterLimit: 3, throwOnLimitExceeded: true });
} catch (err) {
    assert(err instanceof Error);
    assert.strictEqual(err.message, &#039;Parameter limit exceeded. Only 3 parameters allowed.&#039;);
}
```

When `throwOnLimitExceeded` is set to `false` (default), **qs** will parse up to the specified `parameterLimit` and ignore the rest without throwing an error.

To bypass the leading question mark, use `ignoreQueryPrefix`:

```javascript
var prefixed = qs.parse(&#039;?a=b&amp;c=d&#039;, { ignoreQueryPrefix: true });
assert.deepEqual(prefixed, { a: &#039;b&#039;, c: &#039;d&#039; });
```

An optional delimiter can also be passed:

```javascript
var delimited = qs.parse(&#039;a=b;c=d&#039;, { delimiter: &#039;;&#039; });
assert.deepEqual(delimited, { a: &#039;b&#039;, c: &#039;d&#039; });
```

Delimiters can be a regular expression too:

```javascript
var regexed = qs.parse(&#039;a=b;c=d,e=f&#039;, { delimiter: /[;,]/ });
assert.deepEqual(regexed, { a: &#039;b&#039;, c: &#039;d&#039;, e: &#039;f&#039; });
```

Option `allowDots` can be used to enable dot notation:

```javascript
var withDots = qs.parse(&#039;a.b=c&#039;, { allowDots: true });
assert.deepEqual(withDots, { a: { b: &#039;c&#039; } });
```

Option `decodeDotInKeys` can be used to decode dots in keys
Note: it implies `allowDots`, so `parse` will error if you set `decodeDotInKeys` to `true`, and `allowDots` to `false`.

```javascript
var withDots = qs.parse(&#039;name%252Eobj.first=John&amp;name%252Eobj.last=Doe&#039;, { decodeDotInKeys: true });
assert.deepEqual(withDots, { &#039;name.obj&#039;: { first: &#039;John&#039;, last: &#039;Doe&#039; }});
```

Option `allowEmptyArrays` can be used to allowing empty array values in object
```javascript
var withEmptyArrays = qs.parse(&#039;foo[]&amp;bar=baz&#039;, { allowEmptyArrays: true });
assert.deepEqual(withEmptyArrays, { foo: [], bar: &#039;baz&#039; });
```

Option `duplicates` can be used to change the behavior when duplicate keys are encountered
```javascript
assert.deepEqual(qs.parse(&#039;foo=bar&amp;foo=baz&#039;), { foo: [&#039;bar&#039;, &#039;baz&#039;] });
assert.deepEqual(qs.parse(&#039;foo=bar&amp;foo=baz&#039;, { duplicates: &#039;combine&#039; }), { foo: [&#039;bar&#039;, &#039;baz&#039;] });
assert.deepEqual(qs.parse(&#039;foo=bar&amp;foo=baz&#039;, { duplicates: &#039;first&#039; }), { foo: &#039;bar&#039; });
assert.deepEqual(qs.parse(&#039;foo=bar&amp;foo=baz&#039;, { duplicates: &#039;last&#039; }), { foo: &#039;baz&#039; });
```

If you have to deal with legacy browsers or services, there&#039;s also support for decoding percent-encoded octets as iso-8859-1:

```javascript
var oldCharset = qs.parse(&#039;a=%A7&#039;, { charset: &#039;iso-8859-1&#039; });
assert.deepEqual(oldCharset, { a: &#039;§&#039; });
```

Some services add an initial `utf8=✓` value to forms so that old Internet Explorer versions are more likely to submit the form as utf-8.
Additionally, the server can check the value against wrong encodings of the checkmark character and detect that a query string or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body was *not* sent as utf-8, eg. if the form had an `accept-charset` parameter or the containing page had a different character set.

**qs** supports this mechanism via the `charsetSentinel` option.
If specified, the `utf8` parameter will be omitted from the returned object.
It will be used to switch to `iso-8859-1`/`utf-8` mode depending on how the checkmark is encoded.

**Important**: When you specify both the `charset` option and the `charsetSentinel` option, the `charset` will be overridden when the request contains a `utf8` parameter from which the actual charset can be deduced.
In that sense the `charset` will behave as the default charset rather than the authoritative charset.

```javascript
var detectedAsUtf8 = qs.parse(&#039;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;a=%C3%B8&#039;, {
    charset: &#039;iso-8859-1&#039;,
    charsetSentinel: true
});
assert.deepEqual(detectedAsUtf8, { a: &#039;ø&#039; });

// Browsers encode the checkmark as &amp;#10003; when submitting as iso-8859-1:
var detectedAsIso8859_1 = qs.parse(&#039;utf8=%26%2310003%3B&amp;a=%F8&#039;, {
    charset: &#039;utf-8&#039;,
    charsetSentinel: true
});
assert.deepEqual(detectedAsIso8859_1, { a: &#039;ø&#039; });
```

If you want to decode the `&amp;#...;` syntax to the actual character, you can specify the `interpretNumericEntities` option as well:

```javascript
var detectedAsIso8859_1 = qs.parse(&#039;a=%26%239786%3B&#039;, {
    charset: &#039;iso-8859-1&#039;,
    interpretNumericEntities: true
});
assert.deepEqual(detectedAsIso8859_1, { a: &#039;☺&#039; });
```

It also works when the charset has been detected in `charsetSentinel` mode.

### Parsing Arrays

**qs** can also parse arrays using a similar `[]` notation:

```javascript
var withArray = qs.parse(&#039;a[]=b&amp;a[]=c&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(withArray, { a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] });
```

You may specify an index as well:

```javascript
var withIndexes = qs.parse(&#039;a[1]=c&amp;a[0]=b&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(withIndexes, { a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] });
```

Note that the only difference between an index in an array and a key in an object is that the value between the brackets must be a number to create an array.
When creating arrays with specific indices, **qs** will compact a sparse array to only the existing values preserving their order:

```javascript
var noSparse = qs.parse(&#039;a[1]=b&amp;a[15]=c&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(noSparse, { a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] });
```

You may also use `allowSparse` option to parse sparse arrays:

```javascript
var sparseArray = qs.parse(&#039;a[1]=2&amp;a[3]=5&#039;, { allowSparse: true });
assert.deepEqual(sparseArray, { a: [, &#039;2&#039;, , &#039;5&#039;] });
```

Note that an empty string is also a value, and will be preserved:

```javascript
var withEmptyString = qs.parse(&#039;a[]=&amp;a[]=b&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(withEmptyString, { a: [&#039;&#039;, &#039;b&#039;] });

var withIndexedEmptyString = qs.parse(&#039;a[0]=b&amp;a[1]=&amp;a[2]=c&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(withIndexedEmptyString, { a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] });
```

**qs** will also limit specifying indices in an array to a maximum index of `20`.
Any array members with an index of greater than `20` will instead be converted to an object with the index as the key.
This is needed to handle cases when someone sent, for example, `a[999999999]` and it will take significant time to iterate over this huge array.

```javascript
var withMaxIndex = qs.parse(&#039;a[100]=b&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(withMaxIndex, { a: { &#039;100&#039;: &#039;b&#039; } });
```

This limit can be overridden by passing an `arrayLimit` option:

```javascript
var withArrayLimit = qs.parse(&#039;a[1]=b&#039;, { arrayLimit: 0 });
assert.deepEqual(withArrayLimit, { a: { &#039;1&#039;: &#039;b&#039; } });
```

If you want to throw an error whenever the array limit is exceeded, set the `throwOnLimitExceeded` option to `true`. This option will generate a descriptive error if the query string exceeds a configured limit.
```javascript
try {
    qs.parse(&#039;a[1]=b&#039;, { arrayLimit: 0, throwOnLimitExceeded: true });
} catch (err) {
    assert(err instanceof Error);
    assert.strictEqual(err.message, &#039;Array limit exceeded. Only 0 elements allowed in an array.&#039;);
}
```

When `throwOnLimitExceeded` is set to `false` (default), **qs** will parse up to the specified `arrayLimit` and if the limit is exceeded, the array will instead be converted to an object with the index as the key

To disable array parsing entirely, set `parseArrays` to `false`.

```javascript
var noParsingArrays = qs.parse(&#039;a[]=b&#039;, { parseArrays: false });
assert.deepEqual(noParsingArrays, { a: { &#039;0&#039;: &#039;b&#039; } });
```

If you mix notations, **qs** will merge the two items into an object:

```javascript
var mixedNotation = qs.parse(&#039;a[0]=b&amp;a[b]=c&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(mixedNotation, { a: { &#039;0&#039;: &#039;b&#039;, b: &#039;c&#039; } });
```

You can also create arrays of objects:

```javascript
var arraysOfObjects = qs.parse(&#039;a[][b]=c&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(arraysOfObjects, { a: [{ b: &#039;c&#039; }] });
```

Some people use comma to join array, **qs** can parse it:
```javascript
var arraysOfObjects = qs.parse(&#039;a=b,c&#039;, { comma: true })
assert.deepEqual(arraysOfObjects, { a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] })
```
(_this cannot convert nested objects, such as `a={b:1},{c:d}`_)

### Parsing primitive/scalar values (numbers, booleans, null, etc)

By default, all values are parsed as strings.
This behavior will not change and is explained in [issue #91](https://github.com/ljharb/qs/issues/91).

```javascript
var primitiveValues = qs.parse(&#039;a=15&amp;b=true&amp;c=null&#039;);
assert.deepEqual(primitiveValues, { a: &#039;15&#039;, b: &#039;true&#039;, c: &#039;null&#039; });
```

If you wish to auto-convert values which look like numbers, booleans, and other values into their primitive counterparts, you can use the [query-types Express JS middleware](https://github.com/xpepermint/query-types) which will auto-convert all request query parameters.

### Stringifying

[](#preventEval)
```javascript
qs.stringify(object, [options]);
```

When stringifying, **qs** by default URI encodes output. Objects are stringified as you would expect:

```javascript
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: &#039;b&#039; }), &#039;a=b&#039;);
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: { b: &#039;c&#039; } }), &#039;a%5Bb%5D=c&#039;);
```

This encoding can be disabled by setting the `encode` option to `false`:

```javascript
var unencoded = qs.stringify({ a: { b: &#039;c&#039; } }, { encode: false });
assert.equal(unencoded, &#039;a[b]=c&#039;);
```

Encoding can be disabled for keys by setting the `encodeValuesOnly` option to `true`:
```javascript
var encodedValues = qs.stringify(
    { a: &#039;b&#039;, c: [&#039;d&#039;, &#039;e=f&#039;], f: [[&#039;g&#039;], [&#039;h&#039;]] },
    { encodeValuesOnly: true }
);
assert.equal(encodedValues,&#039;a=b&amp;c[0]=d&amp;c[1]=e%3Df&amp;f[0][0]=g&amp;f[1][0]=h&#039;);
```

This encoding can also be replaced by a custom encoding method set as `encoder` option:

```javascript
var encoded = qs.stringify({ a: { b: &#039;c&#039; } }, { encoder: function (str) {
    // Passed in values `a`, `b`, `c`
    return // Return encoded string
}})
```

_(Note: the `encoder` option does not apply if `encode` is `false`)_

Analogue to the `encoder` there is a `decoder` option for `parse` to override decoding of properties and values:

```javascript
var decoded = qs.parse(&#039;x=z&#039;, { decoder: function (str) {
    // Passed in values `x`, `z`
    return // Return decoded string
}})
```

You can encode keys and values using different logic by using the type argument provided to the encoder:

```javascript
var encoded = qs.stringify({ a: { b: &#039;c&#039; } }, { encoder: function (str, defaultEncoder, charset, type) {
    if (type === &#039;key&#039;) {
        return // Encoded key
    } else if (type === &#039;value&#039;) {
        return // Encoded value
    }
}})
```

The type argument is also provided to the decoder:

```javascript
var decoded = qs.parse(&#039;x=z&#039;, { decoder: function (str, defaultDecoder, charset, type) {
    if (type === &#039;key&#039;) {
        return // Decoded key
    } else if (type === &#039;value&#039;) {
        return // Decoded value
    }
}})
```

Examples beyond this point will be shown as though the output is not URI encoded for clarity.
Please note that the return values in these cases *will* be URI encoded during real usage.

When arrays are stringified, they follow the `arrayFormat` option, which defaults to `indices`:

```javascript
qs.stringify({ a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;, &#039;d&#039;] });
// &#039;a[0]=b&amp;a[1]=c&amp;a[2]=d&#039;
```

You may override this by setting the `indices` option to `false`, or to be more explicit, the `arrayFormat` option to `repeat`:

```javascript
qs.stringify({ a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;, &#039;d&#039;] }, { indices: false });
// &#039;a=b&amp;a=c&amp;a=d&#039;
```

You may use the `arrayFormat` option to specify the format of the output array:

```javascript
qs.stringify({ a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] }, { arrayFormat: &#039;indices&#039; })
// &#039;a[0]=b&amp;a[1]=c&#039;
qs.stringify({ a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] }, { arrayFormat: &#039;brackets&#039; })
// &#039;a[]=b&amp;a[]=c&#039;
qs.stringify({ a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] }, { arrayFormat: &#039;repeat&#039; })
// &#039;a=b&amp;a=c&#039;
qs.stringify({ a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;] }, { arrayFormat: &#039;comma&#039; })
// &#039;a=b,c&#039;
```

Note: when using `arrayFormat` set to `&#039;comma&#039;`, you can also pass the `commaRoundTrip` option set to `true` or `false`, to append `[]` on single-item arrays, so that they can round trip through a parse.

When objects are stringified, by default they use bracket notation:

```javascript
qs.stringify({ a: { b: { c: &#039;d&#039;, e: &#039;f&#039; } } });
// &#039;a[b][c]=d&amp;a[b][e]=f&#039;
```

You may override this to use dot notation by setting the `allowDots` option to `true`:

```javascript
qs.stringify({ a: { b: { c: &#039;d&#039;, e: &#039;f&#039; } } }, { allowDots: true });
// &#039;a.b.c=d&amp;a.b.e=f&#039;
```

You may encode the dot notation in the keys of object with option `encodeDotInKeys` by setting it to `true`:
Note: it implies `allowDots`, so `stringify` will error if you set `decodeDotInKeys` to `true`, and `allowDots` to `false`.
Caveat: when `encodeValuesOnly` is `true` as well as `encodeDotInKeys`, only dots in keys and nothing else will be encoded.
```javascript
qs.stringify({ &quot;name.obj&quot;: { &quot;first&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Doe&quot; } }, { allowDots: true, encodeDotInKeys: true })
// &#039;name%252Eobj.first=John&amp;name%252Eobj.last=Doe&#039;
```

You may allow empty array values by setting the `allowEmptyArrays` option to `true`:
```javascript
qs.stringify({ foo: [], bar: &#039;baz&#039; }, { allowEmptyArrays: true });
// &#039;foo[]&amp;bar=baz&#039;
```

Empty strings and null values will omit the value, but the equals sign (=) remains in place:

```javascript
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: &#039;&#039; }), &#039;a=&#039;);
```

Key with no values (such as an empty object or array) will return nothing:

```javascript
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: [] }), &#039;&#039;);
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: {} }), &#039;&#039;);
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: [{}] }), &#039;&#039;);
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: { b: []} }), &#039;&#039;);
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: { b: {}} }), &#039;&#039;);
```

Properties that are set to `undefined` will be omitted entirely:

```javascript
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: null, b: undefined }), &#039;a=&#039;);
```

The query string may optionally be prepended with a question mark:

```javascript
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: &#039;b&#039;, c: &#039;d&#039; }, { addQueryPrefix: true }), &#039;?a=b&amp;c=d&#039;);
```

The delimiter may be overridden with stringify as well:

```javascript
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: &#039;b&#039;, c: &#039;d&#039; }, { delimiter: &#039;;&#039; }), &#039;a=b;c=d&#039;);
```

If you only want to override the serialization of `Date` objects, you can provide a `serializeDate` option:

```javascript
var date = new Date(7);
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: date }), &#039;a=1970-01-01T00:00:00.007Z&#039;.replace(/:/g, &#039;%3A&#039;));
assert.equal(
    qs.stringify({ a: date }, { serializeDate: function (d) { return d.getTime(); } }),
    &#039;a=7&#039;
);
```

You may use the `sort` option to affect the order of parameter keys:

```javascript
function alphabeticalSort(a, b) {
    return a.localeCompare(b);
}
assert.equal(qs.stringify({ a: &#039;c&#039;, z: &#039;y&#039;, b : &#039;f&#039; }, { sort: alphabeticalSort }), &#039;a=c&amp;b=f&amp;z=y&#039;);
```

Finally, you can use the `filter` option to restrict which keys will be included in the stringified output.
If you pass a function, it will be called for each key to obtain the replacement value.
Otherwise, if you pass an array, it will be used to select properties and array indices for stringification:

```javascript
function filterFunc(prefix, value) {
    if (prefix == &#039;b&#039;) {
        // Return an `undefined` value to omit a property.
        return;
    }
    if (prefix == &#039;e[f]&#039;) {
        return value.getTime();
    }
    if (prefix == &#039;e[g][0]&#039;) {
        return value * 2;
    }
    return value;
}
qs.stringify({ a: &#039;b&#039;, c: &#039;d&#039;, e: { f: new Date(123), g: [2] } }, { filter: filterFunc });
// &#039;a=b&amp;c=d&amp;e[f]=123&amp;e[g][0]=4&#039;
qs.stringify({ a: &#039;b&#039;, c: &#039;d&#039;, e: &#039;f&#039; }, { filter: [&#039;a&#039;, &#039;e&#039;] });
// &#039;a=b&amp;e=f&#039;
qs.stringify({ a: [&#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;, &#039;d&#039;], e: &#039;f&#039; }, { filter: [&#039;a&#039;, 0, 2] });
// &#039;a[0]=b&amp;a[2]=d&#039;
```

You could also use `filter` to inject custom serialization for user defined types.

## Types

  &lt;a name=&quot;types--primitives&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [1.1](#types--primitives) **Primitives**: When you access a primitive type you work directly on its value.

    - `string`
    - `number`
    - `boolean`
    - `null`
    - `undefined`
    - `symbol`
    - `bigint`

    &lt;br /&gt;

    ```javascript
    const foo = 1;
    let bar = foo;

    bar = 9;

    console.log(foo, bar); // =&gt; 1, 9
    ```

    - Symbols and BigInts cannot be faithfully polyfilled, so they should not be used when targeting browsers/environments that don’t support them natively.

  &lt;a name=&quot;types--complex&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [1.2](#types--complex)  **Complex**: When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.

    - `object`
    - `array`
    - `function`

    &lt;br /&gt;

    ```javascript
    const foo = [1, 2];
    const bar = foo;

    bar[0] = 9;

    console.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // =&gt; 9, 9
    ```

## References

  &lt;a name=&quot;references--prefer-const&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [2.1](#references--prefer-const) Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`. eslint: [`prefer-const`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const), [`no-const-assign`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-const-assign)

    &gt; Why? This ensures that you can’t reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;

    // good
    const a = 1;
    const b = 2;
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;references--disallow-var&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [2.2](#references--disallow-var) If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`. eslint: [`no-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var)

    &gt; Why? `let` is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like `var`.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    var count = 1;
    if (true) {
      count += 1;
    }

    // good, use the let.
    let count = 1;
    if (true) {
      count += 1;
    }
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;references--block-scope&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [2.3](#references--block-scope) Note that both `let` and `const` are block-scoped, whereas `var` is function-scoped.

    ```javascript
    // const and let only exist in the blocks they are defined in.
    {
      let a = 1;
      const b = 1;
      var c = 1;
    }
    console.log(a); // ReferenceError
    console.log(b); // ReferenceError
    console.log(c); // Prints 1
    ```

    In the above code, you can see that referencing `a` and `b` will produce a ReferenceError, while `c` contains the number. This is because `a` and `b` are block scoped, while `c` is scoped to the containing function.

## Objects

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--no-new&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.1](#objects--no-new) Use the literal syntax for object creation. eslint: [`no-new-object`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new-object)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const item = new Object();

    // good
    const item = {};
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-computed-properties&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.2](#es6-computed-properties) Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names.

    &gt; Why? They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place.

    ```javascript

    function getKey(k) {
      return `a key named ${k}`;
    }

    // bad
    const obj = {
      id: 5,
      name: &#039;San Francisco&#039;,
    };
    obj[getKey(&#039;enabled&#039;)] = true;

    // good
    const obj = {
      id: 5,
      name: &#039;San Francisco&#039;,
      [getKey(&#039;enabled&#039;)]: true,
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-object-shorthand&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.3](#es6-object-shorthand) Use object method shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const atom = {
      value: 1,

      addValue: function (value) {
        return atom.value + value;
      },
    };

    // good
    const atom = {
      value: 1,

      addValue(value) {
        return atom.value + value;
      },
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-object-concise&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.4](#es6-object-concise) Use property value shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand)

    &gt; Why? It is shorter and descriptive.

    ```javascript
    const lukeSkywalker = &#039;Luke Skywalker&#039;;

    // bad
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker: lukeSkywalker,
    };

    // good
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker,
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--grouped-shorthand&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.5](#objects--grouped-shorthand) Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration.

    &gt; Why? It’s easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand.

    ```javascript
    const anakinSkywalker = &#039;Anakin Skywalker&#039;;
    const lukeSkywalker = &#039;Luke Skywalker&#039;;

    // bad
    const obj = {
      episodeOne: 1,
      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,
      lukeSkywalker,
      episodeThree: 3,
      mayTheFourth: 4,
      anakinSkywalker,
    };

    // good
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker,
      anakinSkywalker,
      episodeOne: 1,
      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,
      episodeThree: 3,
      mayTheFourth: 4,
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--quoted-props&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.6](#objects--quoted-props) Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. eslint: [`quote-props`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quote-props)

    &gt; Why? In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const bad = {
      &#039;foo&#039;: 3,
      &#039;bar&#039;: 4,
      &#039;data-blah&#039;: 5,
    };

    // good
    const good = {
      foo: 3,
      bar: 4,
      &#039;data-blah&#039;: 5,
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--prototype-builtins&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.7](#objects--prototype-builtins) Do not call `Object.prototype` methods directly, such as `hasOwnProperty`, `propertyIsEnumerable`, and `isPrototypeOf`. eslint: [`no-prototype-builtins`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-prototype-builtins)

    &gt; Why? These methods may be shadowed by properties on the object in question - consider `{ hasOwnProperty: false }` - or, the object may be a null object (`Object.create(null)`). In modern browsers that support ES2022, or with a polyfill such as &lt;https://npmjs.com/object.hasown&gt;, `Object.hasOwn` can also be used as an alternative to `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    console.log(object.hasOwnProperty(key));

    // good
    console.log(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key));

    // better
    const has = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty; // cache the lookup once, in module scope.
    console.log(has.call(object, key));

    // best
    console.log(Object.hasOwn(object, key)); // only supported in browsers that support ES2022

    /* or */
    import has from &#039;has&#039;; // https://www.npmjs.com/package/has
    console.log(has(object, key));
    /* or */
    console.log(Object.hasOwn(object, key)); // https://www.npmjs.com/package/object.hasown
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--rest-spread&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.8](#objects--rest-spread) Prefer the object spread syntax over [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) to shallow-copy objects. Use the object rest parameter syntax to get a new object with certain properties omitted. eslint: [`prefer-object-spread`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-object-spread)

    ```javascript
    // very bad
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = Object.assign(original, { c: 3 }); // this mutates `original` ಠ_ಠ
    delete copy.a; // so does this

    // bad
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = Object.assign({}, original, { c: 3 }); // copy =&gt; { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

    // good
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = { ...original, c: 3 }; // copy =&gt; { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

    const { a, ...noA } = copy; // noA =&gt; { b: 2, c: 3 }
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Arrays

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--literals&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.1](#arrays--literals) Use the literal syntax for array creation. eslint: [`no-array-constructor`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-array-constructor)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const items = new Array();

    // good
    const items = [];
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--push&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.2](#arrays--push) Use [Array#push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.

    ```javascript
    const someStack = [];

    // bad
    someStack[someStack.length] = &#039;abracadabra&#039;;

    // good
    someStack.push(&#039;abracadabra&#039;);
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-array-spreads&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.3](#es6-array-spreads) Use array spreads `...` to copy arrays.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const len = items.length;
    const itemsCopy = [];
    let i;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i += 1) {
      itemsCopy[i] = items[i];
    }

    // good
    const itemsCopy = [...items];
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--from&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--from-iterable&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.4](#arrays--from-iterable) To convert an iterable object to an array, use spreads `...` instead of [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from)

    ```javascript
    const foo = document.querySelectorAll(&#039;.foo&#039;);

    // good
    const nodes = Array.from(foo);

    // best
    const nodes = [...foo];
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--from-array-like&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.5](#arrays--from-array-like) Use [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) for converting an array-like object to an array.

    ```javascript
    const arrLike = { 0: &#039;foo&#039;, 1: &#039;bar&#039;, 2: &#039;baz&#039;, length: 3 };

    // bad
    const arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(arrLike);

    // good
    const arr = Array.from(arrLike);
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--mapping&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.6](#arrays--mapping) Use [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) instead of spread `...` for mapping over iterables, because it avoids creating an intermediate array.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const baz = [...foo].map(bar);

    // good
    const baz = Array.from(foo, bar);
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--callback-return&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.7](#arrays--callback-return) Use return statements in array method callbacks. It’s ok to omit the return if the function body consists of a single statement returning an expression without side effects, following [8.2](#arrows--implicit-return). eslint: [`array-callback-return`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/array-callback-return)

    ```javascript
    // good
    [1, 2, 3].map((x) =&gt; {
      const y = x + 1;
      return x * y;
    });

    // good
    [1, 2, 3].map((x) =&gt; x + 1);

    // bad - no returned value means `acc` becomes undefined after the first iteration
    [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((acc, item, index) =&gt; {
      const flatten = acc.concat(item);
    });

    // good
    [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((acc, item, index) =&gt; {
      const flatten = acc.concat(item);
      return flatten;
    });

    // bad
    inbox.filter((msg) =&gt; {
      const { subject, author } = msg;
      if (subject === &#039;Mockingbird&#039;) {
        return author === &#039;Harper Lee&#039;;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    });

    // good
    inbox.filter((msg) =&gt; {
      const { subject, author } = msg;
      if (subject === &#039;Mockingbird&#039;) {
        return author === &#039;Harper Lee&#039;;
      }

      return false;
    });
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--bracket-newline&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.8](#arrays--bracket-newline) Use line breaks after opening array brackets and before closing array brackets, if an array has multiple lines

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const arr = [
      [0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5],
    ];

    const objectInArray = [{
      id: 1,
    }, {
      id: 2,
    }];

    const numberInArray = [
      1, 2,
    ];

    // good
    const arr = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]];

    const objectInArray = [
      {
        id: 1,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
      },
    ];

    const numberInArray = [
      1,
      2,
    ];
    ```

## Destructuring

  &lt;a name=&quot;destructuring--object&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [5.1](#destructuring--object) Use object destructuring when accessing and using multiple properties of an object. eslint: [`prefer-destructuring`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)

    &gt; Why? Destructuring saves you from creating temporary references for those properties, and from repetitive access of the object. Repeating object access creates more repetitive code, requires more reading, and creates more opportunities for mistakes. Destructuring objects also provides a single site of definition of the object structure that is used in the block, rather than requiring reading the entire block to determine what is used.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function getFullName(user) {
      const firstName = user.firstName;
      const lastName = user.lastName;

      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }

    // good
    function getFullName(user) {
      const { firstName, lastName } = user;
      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }

    // best
    function getFullName({ firstName, lastName }) {
      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;destructuring--array&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [5.2](#destructuring--array) Use array destructuring. eslint: [`prefer-destructuring`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)

    ```javascript
    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

    // bad
    const first = arr[0];
    const second = arr[1];

    // good
    const [first, second] = arr;
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;destructuring--object-over-array&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [5.3](#destructuring--object-over-array) Use object destructuring for multiple return values, not array destructuring.

    &gt; Why? You can add new properties over time or change the order of things without breaking call sites.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function processInput(input) {
      // then a miracle occurs
      return [left, right, top, bottom];
    }

    // the caller needs to think about the order of return data
    const [left, __, top] = processInput(input);

    // good
    function processInput(input) {
      // then a miracle occurs
      return { left, right, top, bottom };
    }

    // the caller selects only the data they need
    const { left, top } = processInput(input);
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Strings

  &lt;a name=&quot;strings--quotes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.1](#strings--quotes) Use single quotes `&#039;&#039;` for strings. eslint: [`quotes`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quotes)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const name = &quot;Capt. Janeway&quot;;

    // bad - template literals should contain interpolation or newlines
    const name = `Capt. Janeway`;

    // good
    const name = &#039;Capt. Janeway&#039;;
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;strings--line-length&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.2](#strings--line-length) Strings that cause the line to go over 100 characters should not be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.

    &gt; Why? Broken strings are painful to work with and make code less searchable.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const errorMessage = &#039;This is a super long error that was thrown because \
    of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do \
    with this, you would get nowhere \
    fast.&#039;;

    // bad
    const errorMessage = &#039;This is a super long error that was thrown because &#039; +
      &#039;of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do &#039; +
      &#039;with this, you would get nowhere fast.&#039;;

    // good
    const errorMessage = &#039;This is a super long error that was thrown because of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do with this, you would get nowhere fast.&#039;;
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-template-literals&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6.4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.3](#es6-template-literals) When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation. eslint: [`prefer-template`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-template) [`template-curly-spacing`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/template-curly-spacing)

    &gt; Why? Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return &#039;How are you, &#039; + name + &#039;?&#039;;
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return [&#039;How are you, &#039;, name, &#039;?&#039;].join();
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${ name }?`;
    }

    // good
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${name}?`;
    }
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;strings--eval&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.4](#strings--eval) Never use `eval()` on a string; it opens too many vulnerabilities. eslint: [`no-eval`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-eval)

  &lt;a name=&quot;strings--escaping&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.5](#strings--escaping) Do not unnecessarily escape characters in strings. eslint: [`no-useless-esca

adapted for JavaScript. This is not a style guide. It&#039;s a guide to producing
[readable, reusable, and refactorable](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/3rs-of-software-architecture) software in JavaScript.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be
universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are
ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of
_Clean Code_.

Our craft of software engineering is just a bit over 50 years old, and we are
still learning a lot. When software architecture is as old as architecture
itself, maybe then we will have harder rules to follow. For now, let these
guidelines serve as a touchstone by which to assess the quality of the
JavaScript code that you and your team produce.

One more thing: knowing these won&#039;t immediately make you a better software
developer, and working with them for many years doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t make
mistakes. Every piece of code starts as a first draft, like wet clay getting
shaped into its final form. Finally, we chisel away the imperfections when
we review it with our peers. Don&#039;t beat yourself up for first drafts that need
improvement. Beat up the code instead!

## **Variables**

### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**

```javascript
const yyyymmdstr = moment().format(&quot;YYYY/MM/DD&quot;);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const currentDate = moment().format(&quot;YYYY/MM/DD&quot;);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

**Bad:**

```javascript
getUserInfo();
getClientData();
getCustomerRecord();
```

**Good:**

```javascript
getUser();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names

We will read more code than we will ever write. It&#039;s important that the code we
do write is readable and searchable. By _not_ naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable. Tools like
[buddy.js](https://github.com/danielstjules/buddy.js) and
[ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/660e0918933e6e7fede26bc675a0763a6b357c94/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers.md)
can help identify unnamed constants.

**Bad:**

```javascript
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
// Declare them as capitalized named constants.
const MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000; //86400000;

setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use explanatory variables

**Bad:**

```javascript
const address = &quot;One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014&quot;;
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
saveCityZipCode(
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2]
);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const address = &quot;One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014&quot;;
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
const [_, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];
saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Mental Mapping

Explicit is better than implicit.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const locations = [&quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;];
locations.forEach(l =&gt; {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  // Wait, what is `l` for again?
  dispatch(l);
});
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const locations = [&quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;];
locations.forEach(location =&gt; {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  dispatch(location);
});
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don&#039;t add unneeded context

If your class/object name tells you something, don&#039;t repeat that in your
variable name.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const Car = {
  carMake: &quot;Honda&quot;,
  carModel: &quot;Accord&quot;,
  carColor: &quot;Blue&quot;
};

function paintCar(car, color) {
  car.carColor = color;
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const Car = {
  make: &quot;Honda&quot;,
  model: &quot;Accord&quot;,
  color: &quot;Blue&quot;
};

function paintCar(car, color) {
  car.color = color;
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use default parameters instead of short circuiting or conditionals

Default parameters are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you
use them, your function will only provide default values for `undefined`
arguments. Other &quot;falsy&quot; values such as `&#039;&#039;`, `&quot;&quot;`, `false`, `null`, `0`, and
`NaN`, will not be replaced by a default value.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  const breweryName = name || &quot;Hipster Brew Co.&quot;;
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name = &quot;Hipster Brew Co.&quot;) {
  // ...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## **Functions**

### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)

Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it
makes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a
combinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with
each separate argument.

One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have
more than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases
where it&#039;s not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an
argument.

Since JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class
boilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a
lot of arguments.

To make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015/ES6
destructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:

1. When someone looks at the function signature, it&#039;s immediately clear what
   properties are being used.
2. It can be used to simulate named parameters.
3. Destructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument
   object passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects. Note:
   objects and arrays that are destructured from the argument object are NOT
   cloned.
4. Linters can warn you about unused properties, which would be impossible
   without destructuring.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createMenu(title, body, buttonText, cancellable) {
  // ...
}

createMenu(&quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;Bar&quot;, &quot;Baz&quot;, true);

```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createMenu({ title, body, buttonText, cancellable }) {
  // ...
}

createMenu({
  title: &quot;Foo&quot;,
  body: &quot;Bar&quot;,
  buttonText: &quot;Baz&quot;,
  cancellable: true
});
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should do one thing

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, it can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you&#039;ll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client =&gt; {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients.filter(isActiveClient).forEach(email);
}

function isActiveClient(client) {
  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Function names should say what they do

**Bad:**

```javascript
function addToDate(date, month) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();

// It&#039;s hard to tell from the function name what is added
addToDate(date, 1);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function addMonthToDate(month, date) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();
addMonthToDate(1, date);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should only be one level of abstraction

When you have more than one level of abstraction your function is usually
doing too much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier
testing.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function parseBetterJSAlternative(code) {
  const REGEXES = [
    // ...
  ];

  const statements = code.split(&quot; &quot;);
  const tokens = [];
  REGEXES.forEach(REGEX =&gt; {
    statements.forEach(statement =&gt; {
      // ...
    });
  });

  const ast = [];
  tokens.forEach(token =&gt; {
    // lex...
  });

  ast.forEach(node =&gt; {
    // parse...
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function parseBetterJSAlternative(code) {
  const tokens = tokenize(code);
  const syntaxTree = parse(tokens);
  syntaxTree.forEach(node =&gt; {
    // parse...
  });
}

function tokenize(code) {
  const REGEXES = [
    // ...
  ];

  const statements = code.split(&quot; &quot;);
  const tokens = [];
  REGEXES.forEach(REGEX =&gt; {
    statements.forEach(statement =&gt; {
      tokens.push(/* ... */);
    });
  });

  return tokens;
}

function parse(tokens) {
  const syntaxTree = [];
  tokens.forEach(token =&gt; {
    syntaxTree.push(/* ... */);
  });

  return syntaxTree;
}
```

### Remove duplicate code

Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because it
means that there&#039;s more than one place to alter something if you need to change
some logic.

Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your
tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that
you keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with
tomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there&#039;s only one place to update!

Oftentimes you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly
different things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you
to have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing
duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of
different things with just one function/module/class.

Getting the abstraction right is critical, that&#039;s why you should follow the
SOLID principles laid out in the _Classes_ section. Bad abstractions can be
worse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make
a good abstraction, do it! Don&#039;t repeat yourself, otherwise you&#039;ll find yourself
updating multiple places anytime you want to change one thing.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function showDeveloperList(developers) {
  developers.forEach(developer =&gt; {
    const expectedSalary = developer.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = developer.getExperience();
    const githubLink = developer.getGithubLink();
    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience,
      githubLink
    };

    render(data);
  });
}

function showManagerList(managers) {
  managers.forEach(manager =&gt; {
    const expectedSalary = manager.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = manager.getExperience();
    const portfolio = manager.getMBAProjects();
    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience,
      portfolio
    };

    render(data);
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function showEmployeeList(employees) {
  employees.forEach(employee =&gt; {
    const expectedSalary = employee.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = employee.getExperience();

    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience
    };

    switch (employee.type) {
      case &quot;manager&quot;:
        data.portfolio = employee.getMBAProjects();
        break;
      case &quot;developer&quot;:
        data.githubLink = employee.getGithubLink();
        break;
    }

    render(data);
  });
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Set default objects with Object.assign

**Bad:**

```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: null,
  body: &quot;Bar&quot;,
  buttonText: null,
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  config.title = config.title || &quot;Foo&quot;;
  config.body = config.body || &quot;Bar&quot;;
  config.buttonText = config.buttonText || &quot;Baz&quot;;
  config.cancellable =
    config.cancellable !== undefined ? config.cancellable : true;
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: &quot;Order&quot;,
  // User did not include &#039;body&#039; key
  buttonText: &quot;Send&quot;,
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  let finalConfig = Object.assign(
    {
      title: &quot;Foo&quot;,
      body: &quot;Bar&quot;,
      buttonText: &quot;Baz&quot;,
      cancellable: true
    },
    config
  );
  return finalConfig
  // config now equals: {title: &quot;Order&quot;, body: &quot;Bar&quot;, buttonText: &quot;Send&quot;, cancellable: true}
  // ...
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don&#039;t use flags as function parameters

Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createFile(name, temp) {
  if (temp) {
    fs.create(`./temp/${name}`);
  } else {
    fs.create(name);
  }
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createFile(name) {
  fs.create(name);
}

function createTempFile(name) {
  createFile(`./temp/${name}`);
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Side Effects (part 1)

A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in
and return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file,
modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a
stranger.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to
centralize where you are doing this. Don&#039;t have several functions and classes
that write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects
without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,
and not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will
be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.

**Bad:**

```javascript
// Global variable referenced by following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it&#039;d be an array and it could break it.
let name = &quot;Ryan McDermott&quot;;

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {
  name = name.split(&quot; &quot;);
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();

console.log(name); // [&#039;Ryan&#039;, &#039;McDermott&#039;];
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name) {
  return name.split(&quot; &quot;);
}

const name = &quot;Ryan McDermott&quot;;
const newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name);

console.log(name); // &#039;Ryan McDermott&#039;;
console.log(newName); // [&#039;Ryan&#039;, &#039;McDermott&#039;];
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Side Effects (part 2)

In JavaScript, some values are unchangeable (immutable) and some are changeable 
(mutable). Objects and arrays are two kinds of mutable values so it&#039;s important 
to handle them carefully when they&#039;re passed as parameters to a function. A 
JavaScript function can change an object&#039;s properties or alter the contents of 
an array which could easily cause bugs elsewhere.

Suppose there&#039;s a function that accepts an array parameter representing a 
shopping cart. If the function makes a change in that shopping cart array - 
by adding an item to purchase, for example - then any other function that 
uses that same `cart` array will be affected by this addition. That may be 
great, however it could also be bad. Let&#039;s imagine a bad situation:

The user clicks the &quot;Purchase&quot; button which calls a `purchase` function that
spawns a network request and sends the `cart` array to the server. Because
of a bad network connection, the `purchase` function has to keep retrying the
request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks an &quot;Add to Cart&quot;
button on an item they don&#039;t actually want before the network request begins?
If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function
will send the accidentally added item because the `cart` array was modified.

A great solution would be for the `addItemToCart` function to always clone the 
`cart`, edit it, and return the clone. This would ensure that functions that are still
using the old shopping cart wouldn&#039;t be affected by the changes.

Two caveats to mention to this approach:

1. There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,
   but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases
   are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!

2. Cloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily,
   this isn&#039;t a big issue in practice because there are
   [great libraries](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) that allow
   this kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as
   it would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) =&gt; {
  cart.push({ item, date: Date.now() });
};
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) =&gt; {
  return [...cart, { item, date: Date.now() }];
};
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don&#039;t write to global functions

Polluting globals is a bad practice in JavaScript because you could clash with another
library and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an
exception in production. Let&#039;s think about an example: what if you wanted to
extend JavaScript&#039;s native Array method to have a `diff` method that could
show the difference between two arrays? You could write your new function
to the `Array.prototype`, but it could clash with another library that tried
to do the same thing. What if that other library was just using `diff` to find
the difference between the first and last elements of an array? This is why it
would be much better to just use ES2015/ES6 classes and simply extend the `Array` global.

**Bad:**

```javascript
Array.prototype.diff = function diff(comparisonArray) {
  const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);
  return this.filter(elem =&gt; !hash.has(elem));
};
```

**Good:**

```javascript
class SuperArray extends Array {
  diff(comparisonArray) {
    const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);
    return this.filter(elem =&gt; !hash.has(elem));
  }
}
```

### Favor functional programming over imperative programming

JavaScript isn&#039;t a functional language in the way that Haskell is, but it has
a functional flavor to it. Functional languages can be cleaner and easier to test.
Favor this style of programming when you can.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: &quot;Uncle Bobby&quot;,
    linesOfCode: 500
  },
  {
    name: &quot;Suzie Q&quot;,
    linesOfCode: 1500
  },
  {
    name: &quot;Jimmy Gosling&quot;,
    linesOfCode: 150
  },
  {
    name: &quot;Gracie Hopper&quot;,
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

let totalOutput = 0;

for (let i = 0; i &lt; programmerOutput.length; i++) {
  totalOutput += programmerOutput[i].linesOfCode;
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: &quot;Uncle Bobby&quot;,
    linesOfCode: 500
  },
  {
    name: &quot;Suzie Q&quot;,
    linesOfCode: 1500
  },
  {
    name: &quot;Jimmy Gosling&quot;,
    linesOfCode: 150
  },
  {
    name: &quot;Gracie Hopper&quot;,
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

const totalOutput = program

#### JavaScript 3D library

The aim of the project is to create an easy-to-use, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose 3D library. The current builds only include WebGL and WebGPU renderers but SVG and CSS3D renderers are also available as addons.

### Usage

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
import * as THREE from &#039;three&#039;;

const width = window.innerWidth, height = window.innerHeight;

// init

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, width / height, 0.01, 10 );
camera.position.z = 1;

const scene = new THREE.Scene();

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
renderer.setSize( width, height );
renderer.setAnimationLoop( animate );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

// animation

function animate( time ) {

	mesh.rotation.x = time / 2000;
	mesh.rotation.y = time / 1000;

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}
```

If everything goes well, you should see [this](https://jsfiddle.net/w43x5Lgh/).

### Cloning this repository

Cloning the repo with all its history results in a ~2 GB download. If you don&#039;t need the whole history you can use the `depth` parameter to significantly reduce download size.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git
```
