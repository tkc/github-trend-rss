            <h2>README</h2><pre># Battery charge limiter for Apple Silicon Macbook devices

&lt;img width=&quot;300px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;./screenshots/tray.png&quot;/&gt;This tool makes it possible to keep a chronically plugged in Apple Silicon Macbook at `80%` battery, since that will prolong the longevity of the battery. It is free and open-source and will remain that way.

&gt; Want to know if this tool does anything or is just a placebo? Read [this excellent article](https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries). TL;DR: keep your battery cool, keep it at 80% when plugged in, and discharge it as shallowly as feasible.

### Requirements

This is an app for Apple Silicon Macs. It will not work on Intel macs. Do you have an older Mac? Consider the free version of the [Al Dente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) software package. It is a good alternative and has a premium version with many more features.

### Installation

- Option 1: install the app through brew with `brew install battery`
- Option 2: [download the app dmg version here](https://github.com/actuallymentor/battery/releases/)
- Option 3: install ONLY the command line interface (see section below)

When installing via brew or dmg, opening the macOS app is required to complete the installation.

The first time you open the app, it will ask for your administator password so it can install the needed components. Please note that the app:

- Discharges your battery until it reaches 80%, **even when plugged in**
- Disables charging when your battery is above 80% charged
- Enables charging when your battery is under 80% charged
- Keeps the limit engaged even after rebooting
- Keeps the limit engaged even after closing the tray app
- Also automatically installs the `battery` command line tool. If you want a custom charging percentage, the CLI is the only way to do that.

## 🖥 Command-line version

&gt; If you don&#039;t know what a &quot;command line&quot; is, ignore this section. You don&#039;t need it.

The GUI app uses a command line tool under the hood. Installing the GUI automatically installs the CLI as well. You can also separately install the CLI.

The CLI is used for managing the battery charging status for Apple Silicon Macbooks. Can be used to enable/disable the Macbook from charging the battery when plugged into power.

### Installation

One-line installation:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/actuallymentor/battery/main/setup.sh | bash
```

This will:

1. Download the precompiled `smc` tool in this repo (built from the [hholtmann/smcFanControl](https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl.git) repository)
2. Install `smc` to `/usr/local/bin`
3. Install `battery` to `/usr/local/bin`

### Usage

Example usage:

```shell
# This will enable charging when your battery dips under 80, and disable it when it exceeds 80
battery maintain 80
```

After running a command like `battery charging off` you can verify the change visually by looking at the battery icon:

![Battery not charging](./screenshots/not-charging-screenshot.png)

After running `battery charging on` you will see it change to this:

![Battery charging](./screenshots/charging-screenshot.png)

For help, run `battery` without parameters:

```
Battery CLI utility v1.0.1

Usage:

  battery status
    output battery SMC status, % and time remaining

  battery maintain LEVEL[1-100,stop]
    reboot-persistent battery level maintenance: turn off charging above, and on below a certain value
    eg: battery maintain 80
    eg: battery maintain stop

  battery charging SETTING[on/off]
    manually set the battery to (not) charge
    eg: battery charging on

  battery adapter SETTING[on/off]
    manually set the adapter to (not) charge even when plugged in
    eg: battery adapter off

  battery calibrate
    calibrate the battery by discharging it to 15%, then recharging it to 100%, and keeping it there for 1 hour

  battery charge LEVEL[1-100]
    charge the battery to a certain percentage, and disable charging when that percentage is reached
    eg: battery charge 90

  battery discharge LEVEL[1-100]
    block power input from the adapter until battery falls to this level
    eg: battery discharge 90

  battery visudo
    ensure you don&#039;t need to call battery with sudo
    This is already used in the setup script, so you should&#039;t need it.

  battery update
    update the battery utility to the latest version

  battery reinstall
    reinstall the battery utility to the latest version (reruns the installation script)

  battery uninstall
    enable charging, remove the smc tool, and the battery script
```

## FAQ &amp; Troubleshooting

### Why does this exist?

I was looking at the Al Dente software package for battery limiting, but I found the [license too limiting](https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente/discussions/558) for a poweruser like myself.

I would actually have preferred using Al Dente, but decided to create a command-line utility to replace it as a side-project on holiday. A colleague mentioned they would like a GUI, so I spend a few evenings setting up an Electron app. And voila, here we are.

### &quot;It&#039;s not working&quot;

If you used one of the earlier versions of the `battery` utility, you may run into [path/permission issues](https://github.com/actuallymentor/battery/issues/8). This is not your fault but mine. To fix it:

```
sudo rm -rf ~/.battery
binfolder=/usr/local/bin
sudo rm -v &quot;$binfolder/smc&quot; &quot;$binfolder/battery&quot;
```

Then reopen the app and things should work. If not, [open an issue](https://github.com/actuallymentor/battery/issues/new/choose) and I&#039;ll try to help you fix it.

### A note to Little Snitch users

This tool calls a number of urls, blocking all of them will only break auto-updates.

1. `unidentifiedanalytics.web.app` is a self-made app that tracks app installations, I use it to see if enough people use the app to justify spending time on it. It tracks only how many unique ip addresses open the app.
1. `icanhazip.com` is used to see if there is an internet connection
1. `github.com` is used both as a liveness check and as the source of updates for the underlying command-line utility
1. `electronjs.org` hosts the update server for the GUI

All urls are called over `https` and so not leak data. Unidentified Analytics keeps track of unique ip addresses that open the app, but nothing else.

### What distinguishes this project from Optimized Charging?

Optimized Charging, a feature that is built into MacOS, aims to ensure the longevity and health of your battery. It does so by &quot;delaying charging the battery past 80% when it predicts that you’ll be plugged in for an extended period of time, and aims to charge the battery before you unplug,&quot; as explained in [Apple&#039;s user guide](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlfc3b7879/mac#:~:text=Optimized%20Battery%20Charging%3A%20To%20reduce,the%20battery%20before%20you%20unplug.).

Additionally, Optimized Charging uses machine learning to decide when the battery should be held at 80%, and when it should become fully charged. If your Mac is not plugged in on a regular schedule, optimized charging will not work as intended.

This app is a similar alternative to Optimized Charging, giving the user control over when it is activated, what percentage the battery should be held at, and more.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Monaco Editor

[![Versions](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/monaco-editor)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor)
[![Versions](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/monaco-editor/next)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor)
[![Feature Requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/microsoft/monaco-editor/feature-request.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)

The Monaco Editor is the fully featured code editor from [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). Check out the [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) to see some of the supported features.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5047891/94183711-290c0780-fea3-11ea-90e3-c88ff9d21bd6.png)

## Try it out

Try out the editor and see various examples [in our interactive playground](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/playground.html).

The playground is the best way to learn about how to use the editor, which features is supports, to try out different versions and to create minimal reproducible examples for bug reports.

## Installing

```
&gt; npm install monaco-editor
```

You will get:

- inside `/esm`: ESM version of the editor (compatible with e.g. webpack)
- `monaco.d.ts`: this specifies the API of the editor (this is what is actually versioned, everything else is considered private and might break with any release).

:warning: The monaco editor also ships an `AMD` build for backwards-compatibility reasons, but the `AMD` support is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.

## Concepts

Monaco editor is best known for being the text editor that powers VS Code. However, it&#039;s a bit more nuanced. Some basic understanding about the underlying concepts is needed to use Monaco editor effectively.

### Models

Models are at the heart of Monaco editor. It&#039;s what you interact with when managing content. A model represents a file that has been opened. This could represent a file that exists on a file system, but it doesn&#039;t have to. For example, the model holds the text content, determines the language of the content, and tracks the edit history of the content.

### URIs

Each model is identified by a URI. This is why it&#039;s not possible for two models to have the same URI. Ideally when you represent content in Monaco editor, you should think of a virtual file system that matches the files your users are editing. For example, you could use `file:///` as a base path. If a model is created without a URI, its URI will be `inmemory://model/1`. The number increases as more models are created.

### Editors

An editor is a user facing view of the model. This is what gets attached to the DOM and what your users see visually. Typical editor operations are displaying a model, managing the view state, or executing actions or commands.

### Providers

Providers provide smart editor features. For example, this includes completion and hover information. It is not the same as, but often maps to [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) features.

Providers work on models. Some smart features depends on the file URI. For example, for TypeScript to resolve imports, or for JSON IntelliSense to determine which JSON schema to apply to which model. So it&#039;s important to choose proper model URIs.

### Disposables

Many Monaco related objects often implement the `.dispose()` method. This method is intended to perform cleanups when a resource is no longer needed. For example, calling `model.dispose()` will unregister it, freeing up the URI for a new model. Editors should be disposed to free up resources and remove their model listeners.

## FAQ

❓ **What is the relationship between VS Code and the Monaco Editor?**

The Monaco Editor is generated straight from VS Code&#039;s sources with some shims around services the code needs to make it run in a web browser outside of its home.

❓ **What is the relationship between VS Code&#039;s version and the Monaco Editor&#039;s version?**

None. The Monaco Editor is a library and it reflects directly the source code.

❓ **I&#039;ve written an extension for VS Code, will it work on the Monaco Editor in a browser?**

No.

&gt; Note: If the extension is fully based on the [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and if the language server is authored in JavaScript, then it would be possible.

❓ **Why all these web workers and why should I care?**

Language services create web workers to compute heavy stuff outside of the UI thread. They cost hardly anything in terms of resource overhead and you shouldn&#039;t worry too much about them, as long as you get them to work (see above the cross-domain case).

❓ **I see the warning &quot;Could not create web worker&quot;. What should I do?**

HTML5 does not allow pages loaded on `file://` to create web workers. Please load the editor with a web server on `http://` or `https://` schemes.

❓ **Is the editor supported in mobile browsers or mobile web app frameworks?**

No.

❓ **Why doesn&#039;t the editor support TextMate grammars?**

- Please see https://github.com/bolinfest/monaco-tm which puts together `monaco-editor`, `vscode-oniguruma` and `vscode-textmate` to get TM grammar support in the editor.

## 前言

很久以前tjy-gitnub看到 Windows 12 概念版（Powered by PowerPoint）后深受启发，决定做一个 Windows 12 网页版，就像 [Windows 11 网页版](https://win11.blueedge.me/) 一样。 它拥有精美的 ui 设计，流畅丰富的动画，各种高级的功能。

于是就有了这个项目（是的，这个项目的诞生就是这么突然）

&gt; 目前移动端适配不太完善，开桌面版网站凑合着用吧 `&gt;v-)o`

## 在线体验

点击[此处](tjy-gitnub.github.io/win12/desktop.html)即可体验。


## 效果展示

&gt; 新的版本有很多变化，仅供参考，请以实物为准（你点一下 [这里](https://tjy-gitnub.github.io/win12/desktop.html) 就知道了啊，不麻烦`-_-)o` ）

# UnblockNeteaseMusic

解锁网易云音乐客户端变灰歌曲

## 特性

- 使用 QQ / 虾米 / 百度 / 酷狗 / 酷我 / 咪咕 / JOOX 音源替换变灰歌曲链接 (默认仅启用一、五、六)
- 为请求增加 `X-Real-IP` 参数解锁海外限制，支持指定网易云服务器 IP，支持设置上游 HTTP / HTTPS 代理
- 完整的流量代理功能 (HTTP / HTTPS)，可直接作为系统代理 (同时支持 PAC)

## 运行

使用 npx

```
$ npx @nondanee/unblockneteasemusic
```

或使用 Docker

```
$ docker run nondanee/unblockneteasemusic
```

```
$ docker-compose up
```

### 配置参数

```
$ unblockneteasemusic -h
usage: unblockneteasemusic [-v] [-p port] [-a address] [-u url] [-f host]
                           [-o source [source ...]] [-t token] [-e url] [-s]
                           [-h]

optional arguments:
  -v, --version                   output the version number
  -p port, --port port            specify server port
  -a address, --address address   specify server host
  -u url, --proxy-url url         request through upstream proxy
  -f host, --force-host host      force the netease server ip
  -o source [source ...], --match-order source [source ...]
                                  set priority of sources
  -t token, --token token         set up proxy authentication
  -e url, --endpoint url          replace virtual endpoint with public host
  -s, --strict                    enable proxy limitation
  -h, --help                      output usage information
```

## 使用

**警告：本项目不提供线上 demo，请不要轻易信任使用他人提供的公开代理服务，以免发生安全问题**

**若将服务部署到公网，强烈建议使用严格模式 (此模式下仅放行网易云音乐所属域名的请求) `-s`  限制代理范围 (需使用 PAC 或 hosts)，~~或启用 Proxy Authentication `-t &lt;name&gt;:&lt;password&gt;` 设置代理用户名密码~~ (目前密码认证在 Windows 客户端设置和 macOS 系统设置都无法生效，请不要使用)，以防代理被他人滥用**

支持 Windows 客户端，UWP 客户端，Android 客户端，Linux 客户端 (1.2 版本以上需要自签证书 MITM，启动客户端需要增加 `--ignore-certificate-errors` 参数)，macOS 客户端 (726 版本以上需要自签证书)，iOS 客户端 (配置 https endpoint 或使用自签证书) 和网页版 (需要自签证书，需要脚本配合)

目前除 UWP 外其它客户端均优先请求 HTTPS 接口，默认配置下本代理对网易云所有 HTTPS API 连接返回空数据，促使客户端降级使用 HTTP 接口 (新版 Linux 客户端和 macOS 客户端已无法降级)

因 UWP 应用存在网络隔离，限制流量发送到本机，若使用的代理在 localhost，或修改的 hosts 指向 localhost，需为 &quot;网易云音乐 UWP&quot; 手动开启 loopback 才能使用，请以**管理员身份**执行命令

```powershell
checknetisolation loopbackexempt -a -n=&quot;1F8B0F94.122165AE053F_j2p0p5q0044a6&quot;
```

### 方法 1. 修改 hosts

向 hosts 文件添加两条规则

```
&lt;Server IP&gt; music.163.com
&lt;Server IP&gt; interface.music.163.com
```

&gt; 使用此方法必须监听 80 端口 `-p 80` 
&gt;
&gt; **若在本机运行程序**，请指定网易云服务器 IP `-f xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` (可在修改 hosts 前通过 `ping music.163.com` 获得) **或** 使用代理 `-u http(s)://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxx`，以防请求死循环
&gt;
&gt; **Android 客户端下修改 hosts 无法直接使用**，原因和解决方法详见[云音乐安卓又搞事啦](https://jixun.moe/post/netease-android-hosts-bypass/)，[安卓免 root 绕过网易云音乐 IP 限制](https://jixun.moe/post/android-block-netease-without-root/)

### 方法 2. 设置代理

PAC 自动代理脚本地址 `http://&lt;Server Name:PORT&gt;/proxy.pac`

全局代理地址填写服务器地址和端口号即可

| 平台    | 基础设置 |
| :------ | :------------------------------- |
| Windows | 设置 &gt; 工具 &gt; 自定义代理 (客户端内) |
| UWP     | Windows 设置 &gt; 网络和 Internet &gt; 代理 |
| Linux   | 系统设置 &gt; 网络 &gt; 网络代理 |
| macOS   | 系统偏好设置 &gt; 网络 &gt; 高级 &gt; 代理 |
| Android | WLAN &gt; 修改网络 &gt; 高级选项 &gt; 代理 |
| iOS     | 无线局域网 &gt; HTTP 代理 &gt; 配置代理 |

&gt; 代理工具和方法有很多请自行探索，欢迎在 issues 讨论

### ✳方法 3. 调用接口

作为依赖库使用

```
$ npm install @nondanee/unblockneteasemusic
```

```javascript
const match = require(&#039;@nondanee/unblockneteasemusic&#039;)

/** 
 * Set proxy or hosts if needed
 */
global.proxy = require(&#039;url&#039;).parse(&#039;http://127.0.0.1:1080&#039;)
global.hosts = {&#039;i.y.qq.com&#039;: &#039;59.37.96.220&#039;}

/**
 * Find matching song from other platforms
 * @param {Number} id netease song id
 * @param {Array&lt;String&gt;||undefined} source support qq, xiami, baidu, kugou, kuwo, migu, joox
 * @return {Promise&lt;Object&gt;}
 */
match(418602084, [&#039;qq&#039;, &#039;kuwo&#039;, &#039;migu&#039;]).then(console.log)
```

🤖 **Fast, light &amp; open-source**—Glass lives on your desktop, sees what you see, listens in real time, understands your context, and turns every moment into structured knowledge.

💬 **Proactive in meetings**—it surfaces action items, summaries, and answers the instant you need them.

🫥️ **Truly invisible**—never shows up in screen recordings, screenshots, or your dock; no always-on capture or hidden sharing.

To have fun building with us, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UCZH5B5Hpd)!

## Instant Launch

⚡️  Skip the setup—launch instantly with our ready-to-run macOS app.  [[Download Here]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/znid09apxiwtwvxer6oc9/Glass_latest.dmg?rlkey=gwvvyb3bizkl25frhs4k1zwds&amp;st=37q31b4w&amp;dl=1)

## Quick Start (Local Build)

### Prerequisites

First download &amp; install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
If you are using Windows, you need to also install [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

Ensure you&#039;re using Node.js version 20.x.x to avoid build errors with native dependencies.

```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# If you need to install Node.js 20.x.x, we recommend using nvm:
# curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# nvm install 20
# nvm use 20
```

### Installation

```bash
npm run setup
```

## Highlights


### Ask: get answers based on all your previous screen actions &amp; audio

&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;booking-screen&quot; src=&quot;./public/assets/00.gif&quot;&gt;

### Meetings: real-time meeting notes, live summaries, session records

&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;booking-screen&quot; src=&quot;./public/assets/01.gif&quot;&gt;

scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.

### Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?

Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don&#039;t plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.

Documentation is still available but it&#039;s moved to
[https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0) and
[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

#### JavaScript 3D library

The aim of the project is to create an easy-to-use, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose 3D library. The current builds only include WebGL and WebGPU renderers but SVG and CSS3D renderers are also available as addons.

### Usage

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
import * as THREE from &#039;three&#039;;

const width = window.innerWidth, height = window.innerHeight;

// init

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, width / height, 0.01, 10 );
camera.position.z = 1;

const scene = new THREE.Scene();

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
renderer.setSize( width, height );
renderer.setAnimationLoop( animate );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

// animation

function animate( time ) {

	mesh.rotation.x = time / 2000;
	mesh.rotation.y = time / 1000;

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}
```

If everything goes well, you should see [this](https://jsfiddle.net/w43x5Lgh/).

Learn more about our [version support](https://jquery.com/support/).

## Contribution Guides

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)

### References to issues/PRs

GitHub issues/PRs are usually referenced via `gh-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue/PR. You can find such an issue/PR under `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/NUMBER`.

jQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under [bugs.jquery.com](https://bugs.jquery.com/). It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern `trac-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under `https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/NUMBER`.

## Environments in which to use jQuery

- [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/)
- jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.

## What you need to build your own jQuery

To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

For Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.

## How to build your own jQuery

First, [clone the jQuery git repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Then, enter the jquery directory, install dependencies, and run the build script:

```bash
cd jquery
npm install
npm run build
```

The built version of jQuery will be placed in the `dist/` directory, along with a minified copy and associated map file.

## Build all jQuery release files

To build all variants of jQuery, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build:all
```

This will create all of the variants that jQuery includes in a release, including `jquery.js`, `jquery.slim.js`, `jquery.module.js`, and `jquery.slim.module.js` along their associated minified files and sourcemaps.

`jquery.module.js` and `jquery.slim.module.js` are [ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that export `jQuery` and `$` as named exports are placed in the `dist-module/` directory rather than the `dist/` directory.

## Building a Custom jQuery

The build script can be used to create a custom version of jQuery that includes only the modules you need.

Any module may be excluded except for `core`. When excluding `selector`, it is not removed but replaced with a small wrapper around native `querySelectorAll` (see below for more information).

### Build Script Help

To see the full list of available options for the build script, run the following:

```bash
npm run build -- --help
```

### Modules

To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the `src` folder (without the `.js` extension) to the `--exclude` option. When using the `--include` option, the default includes are dropped and a build is created with only those modules.

Some example modules that can be excluded or included are:

- **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.
- **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.
- **ajax/script**: The `&lt;script&gt;` AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.
- **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.
- **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).
- **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.
- **deprecated**: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.
- **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.
- **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(&quot;slow&quot;)`.
- **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.
- **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.
- **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.
- **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.
- **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(&quot;ready&quot;, ...)` or similar will not be triggered.
- **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.
- **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.
- **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.

- **selector**: The full jQuery selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced with a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser&#039;s `querySelectorAll` method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the [selector-native.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/src/selector-native.js) file for details.

*Note*: Excluding the full `selector` module will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as `effects/animatedSelector` and `css/hiddenVisibleSelectors`).

##### AMD name

You can set the module name for jQuery&#039;s AMD definition. By default, it is set to &quot;jquery&quot;, which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you&#039;d like to change this. Pass it to the `--amd` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --amd=&quot;custom-name&quot;
```

Or, to define anonymously, leave the name blank.

```bash
npm run build -- --amd
```

##### File name and directory

The default name for the built jQuery file is `jquery.js`; it is placed under the `dist/` directory. It&#039;s possible to change the file name using `--filename` and the directory using `--dir`. `--dir` is relative to the project root.

```bash
npm run build -- --slim --filename=&quot;jquery.slim.js&quot; --dir=&quot;/tmp&quot;
```

This would create a slim version of jQuery and place it under `tmp/jquery.slim.js`.

##### ECMAScript Module (ESM) mode

By default, jQuery generates a regular script JavaScript file. You can also generate an ECMAScript module exporting `jQuery` as the default export using the `--esm` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.module.js --esm
```

##### Factory mode

By default, jQuery depends on a global `window`. For environments that don&#039;t have one, you can generate a factory build that exposes a function accepting `window` as a parameter that you can provide externally (see [`README` of the published package](build/fixtures/README.md) for usage instructions). You can generate such a factory using the `--factory` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.js --factory
```

This option can be mixed with others like `--esm` or `--slim`:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.slim.module.js --factory --esm --slim --dir=&quot;/dist-module&quot;
```

#### Custom Build Examples

Create a custom build using `npm run build`, listing the modules to be excluded. Excluding a top-level module also excludes its corresponding directory of modules.

Exclude all **ajax** functionality:

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=ajax
```

Excluding **css** removes modules depending on CSS: **effects**, **offset**, **dimensions**.

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=css
```

Exclude a bunch of modules (`-e` is an alias for `--exclude`):

```bash
npm run build -- -e ajax/jsonp -e css -e deprecated -e dimensions -e effects -e offset -e wrap
```

There is a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.js --slim
```

Or, to create the slim build as an esm module:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.module.js --slim --esm
```

*Non-official custom builds are not regularly tested. Use them at your own risk.*

## Running the Unit Tests

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start `npm start` to auto-build jQuery as you work:

```bash
npm start
```

Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the &quot;test&quot; directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:

- Windows: [WAMP download](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
- Mac: [MAMP download](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
- Linux: [Setting up LAMP](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/easy-lamp-server-installation/)
- [Mongoose (most platforms)](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)

## Essential Git

As the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it&#039;s useful to know some features used.

### Cleaning

If you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you&#039;ve worked on is gone after these):

```bash
git reset --hard upstream/main
git clean -fdx
```

### Rebasing

For feature/topic branches, you should always use the `--rebase` flag to `git pull`, or if you are usually handling many temporary &quot;to be in a github pull request&quot; branches, run the following to automate this:

```bash
git config branch.autosetuprebase local
```

(see `man git-config` for more information)

### Handling merge conflicts

If you&#039;re getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature
`git mergetool`. Even though the default tool `xxdiff` looks awful/old, it&#039;s rather useful.

The following are some commands that can be used there:

- `Ctrl + Alt + M` - automerge as much as possible
- `b` - jump to next merge conflict
- `s` - change the order of the conflicted lines
- `u` - undo a merge
- `left mouse button` - mark a block to be the winner
- `middle mouse button` - mark a line to be the winner
- `Ctrl + S` - save
- `Ctrl + Q` - quit

## [QUnit](https://api.qunitjs.com) Reference

### Test methods

```js
expect( numAssertions );
stop();
start();
```

*Note*: QUnit&#039;s eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.

### Test assertions

```js
ok( value, [message] );
equal( actual, expected, [message] );
notEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
deepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
strictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
throws( block, [expected], [message] );
```

## Test Suite Convenience Methods Reference

See [test/data/testinit.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/test/data/testinit.js).

### Returns an array of elements with the given IDs

```js
q( ... );
```

Example:

```js
q( &quot;main&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; );

=&gt; [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]
```

### Asserts that a selection matches the given IDs

```js
t( testName, selector, [ &quot;array&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;ids&quot; ] );
```

Example:

```js
t(&quot;Check for something&quot;, &quot;//[a]&quot;, [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]);
```

### Fires a native DOM event without going through jQuery

```js
fireNative( node, eventType );
```

Example:

```js
fireNative( jQuery( &quot;#elem&quot; )[ 0 ], &quot;click&quot; );
```

### Add random number to url to stop caching

```js
url( &quot;some/url&quot; );
```

Example:

```js
url( &quot;index.html&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/index.html?10538358428943&quot;


url( &quot;mock.php?foo=bar&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/mock.php?foo=bar&amp;10538358345554&quot;
```

### Run tests in an iframe

Some tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and
these can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions
remain in jQuery&#039;s main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup
and setup code should be placed in the iframe file.

```js
testIframe( testName, fileName,
  function testCallback(
      assert, jQuery, window, document,
	  [ additional args ] ) {
	...
  } );
```

This loads a page, constructing a url with fileName `&quot;./data/&quot; + fileName`.
The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by
including the &quot;/test/data/iframeTest.js&quot; script and calling
`startIframeTest( [ additional args ] )` when appropriate. Often this
will be after either document ready or `window.onload` fires.

The `testCallback` receives the QUnit `assert` object created by `testIframe`
for this test, followed by the global `jQuery`, `window`, and `document` from
the iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to `startIframeTest`,
they follow the `document` argument.

[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/leaningtech/webvm)](https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/issues)

This repository hosts the source code for [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io), a Linux virtual machine that runs in your browser.

Try out the new Alpine / Xorg / i3 graphical environment: [https://webvm.io/alpine.html](https://webvm.io/alpine.html)

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/welcome_to_WebVM_alpine_2024.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

WebVM is a server-less virtual environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. It&#039;s designed to be Linux ABI-compatible. It runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.

WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser. CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator. 

# Enable networking

Modern browsers do not provide APIs to directly use TCP or UDP. WebVM provides networking support by integrating with Tailscale, a VPN network that supports WebSockets as a transport layer.

- Open the &quot;Networking&quot; panel from the side-bar
- Click &quot;Connect to Tailscale&quot; from the panel
- Log in to Tailscale (create an account if you don&#039;t have one)
- Click &quot;Connect&quot; when prompted by Tailscale
- If you are unfamiliar with Tailscale or would like additional information see [WebVM and Tailscale](/docs/Tailscale.md).

# Fork, deploy, customize

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fork_deploy_instructions.gif&quot; alt=&quot;deploy_instructions_gif&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

- Fork the repository.
- Enable Github pages in settings.
	- Click on `Settings`.
	- Go to the `Pages` section.

# How to use Claude AI

To access Claude AI, you need an API key. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Create an account
- Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/login) and sign up with your e-mail. You&#039;ll receive a sign in link to the Anthropic Console. 

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/anthropic_signup.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

2. Get your API key
- Once logged in, navigate to **Get API keys**.
- Purchase the amount of credits you need. After completing the purchase, you&#039;ll be able to generate the key through the API console.

3. Log in with your API key
- Navigate to your WebVM and hover over the robot icon. This will show the Claude AI Integration tab. For added convenience, you can click the pin button in the top right corner to keep the tab in place.
- You&#039;ll see a prompt where you can insert your Claude API key.
- Insert your key and press enter.

4. Start using Claude AI
- Once your API key is entered, you can begin interacting with Claude AI by asking questions such as:

 __&quot;Solve the CTF challenge at `/home/user/chall1.bin.` Note that the binary reads from stdin.&quot;__

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/webvm_claude_ctf.gif&quot; alt=&quot;deploy_instructions_gif&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

**Important:** Your API key is private and should never be shared. We do not have access to your key, which is not only stored locally in your browser.

## introduction

htmx allows you to access  [AJAX](https://htmx.org/docs#ajax), [CSS Transitions](https://htmx.org/docs#css_transitions),
[WebSockets](https://htmx.org/extensions/ws/) and [Server Sent Events](https://htmx.org/extensions/sse/)
directly in HTML, using [attributes](https://htmx.org/reference#attributes), so you can build
[modern user interfaces](https://htmx.org/examples) with the [simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) and
[power](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) of hypertext

htmx is small ([~14k min.gz&#039;d](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htmx.org/dist/)),
[dependency-free](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/package.json) &amp;
[extendable](https://htmx.org/extensions)

## motivation

* Why should only `&lt;a&gt;` and `&lt;form&gt;` be able to make HTTP requests?
* Why should only `click` &amp; `submit` events trigger them?
* Why should only GET &amp; POST be available?
* Why should you only be able to replace the *entire* screen?

By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a
[hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)

## quick start

```html
  &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htmx.org@2.0.7/dist/htmx.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX --&gt;
  &lt;button hx-post=&quot;/clicked&quot; hx-swap=&quot;outerHTML&quot;&gt;
    Click Me
  &lt;/button&gt;
```

The [`hx-post`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-post) and [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap) attributes tell htmx:

&gt; &quot;When a user clicks on this button, issue an AJAX request to /clicked, and replace the entire button with the response&quot;

htmx is the successor to [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org)

### installing as a node package

To install using npm:

```
npm install htmx.org --save
```

Note there is an old broken package called `htmx`.  This is `htmx.org`.

### hacking guide

To develop htmx locally, you will need to install the development dependencies.

Run:

```
npm install
```

Then, run a web server in the root.

This is easiest with:

```
npx serve
```

You can then run the test suite by navigating to:

&lt;http://0.0.0.0:3000/test/&gt;

At this point you can modify `/src/htmx.js` to add features, and then add tests in the appropriate area under `/test`.

* `/test/index.html` - the root test page from which all other tests are included
* `/test/attributes` - attribute specific tests
* `/test/core` - core functionality tests
* `/test/core/regressions.js` - regression tests
* `/test/ext` - extension tests
* `/test/manual` - manual tests that cannot be automated

htmx uses the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework, the [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion framework
and [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/releases/v9/fake-xhr-and-server/) to mock out AJAX requests.  They are all OK.
