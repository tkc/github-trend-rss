[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.

## Contributing

PDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors. To

Feel free to stop by our [Matrix room](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#pdfjs:mozilla.org) for questions or guidance.

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the &quot;Modern browsers&quot; version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools &gt; Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.

For an introduction to the PDF.js code, check out the presentation by our
contributor Julian Viereck:

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

&lt;br/&gt;

**The Serverless Framework** – Makes it easy to use AWS Lambda and other managed cloud services to build applications that auto-scale, cost nothing when idle, and result in radically low maintenance.

The Serverless Framework is a command-line tool with approachable YAML syntax to deploy both your code and cloud infrastructure needed to make tons of serverless application use-cases, like APIs, front-ends, data pipelines and scheduled tasks. It&#039;s a multi-language framework that supports Node.js, Typescript, Python, Go, Java, and more. It&#039;s also completely extensible via over 1,000 plugins which add more serverless use-cases and workflows to the Framework.

# Serverless Framework - V.4

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

**December 2025** – V.4 continues to feature significant updates. Review them all below. In December 2025 we released support for numerous new features announced at AWS re:invent, like new runtimes, new regions, HTTP response streaming with API Gateway, Lambda tenant isolation, and much more. As always, we are more excited about the serverless future than ever.

## New Features In V.4

Here&#039;s a list of everything that&#039;s new in V.4, so far:

- **Lambda tenant isolation mode:** Use tenant isolation mode to create distinct Lambda compute environments per tenant to help reduce noisy neighbor effects and isolate high traffic customers more cleanly.
- **HTTP response streaming:** Stream logs, long-running reports, partial respones, or AI LLM responses from Lambda with API Gateway HTTP APIs.
- **Per-function IAM roles:** Add per-function IAM policies or switch the entire service to use per-function policies.
- **Improved Custom Domain Support:** You no longer need an external plugin to automatically configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your APIs and more. It&#039;s now built into the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/domains).
- **Integration with Doppler:** You can now easily fetch Secrets from Doppler via [Serverless Framework Variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/doppler).
- **Introducing [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp):** Built for Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI-powered IDEs, it auto-detects cloud resources from your code, fetching logs, state, and config from AWS, enabling you to debug serverless apps directly in your IDE — no AWS console visit needed! Supports Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, and more.
- **Introducing the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers):** One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere - This is a new YAML file that works with the Serverless Framework CLI that gives you one experience to easily deploy containers to AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate and migrate between them w/ zero-downtime — all without re-architecting. We launched this as a way to reduce large Lambda bills and give folks flexibility, but it is rapidly become the greatest developer experience for containers on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Run, Azure and more are coming soon.
- **Support for AWS SAM, AWS Cloudformation, &amp; Traditional Serverless Framework Projects:** Now, you can use one tool to deploy all three of these IaC project files. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sam)
- **Native Typescript Support:** You can now use `.ts` handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in `serverless.yml` and have them build automatically upon deploy. [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/building).
- **The AWS AI Stack:** V.4 is optimized for [the AWS AI Stack](https://github.com/serverless/aws-ai-stack). Deploy a full-stack, serverless, boilerplate for AI applications on AWS, featuring Bedrock LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama3.1 and much more.

- **Automatic Updates:** These happen by default now. Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you&#039;re open to.
- **Improved Onboarding &amp; Set-Up:** The `serverless` command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project.
- **Updated Custom Resource Handlers:** All custom resource handlers now use `nodejs20.x`.
- **Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers:** Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework &quot;Extensions&quot;.

## Breaking Changes

We&#039;re seeking to avoid breaking changes for the &quot;aws&quot; Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of:

- The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this.
- Authentication is required within the CLI.
- Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.

If you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what&#039;s different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).

## License Changes in V.4

Please note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.

# &lt;a name=&quot;quick-start&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quick Start

Here&#039;s how to install the Serverless Framework, set up a project and deploy it to Amazon Web Services on serverless infrastructure like AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3 and more.

&lt;br/&gt;

## Install the Serverless Framework via NPM

First, you must have the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org) installed, version 18.20.3 or greater, then you can install the Serverless Framework via NPM.

Open your CLI and run the command below to install the Serverless Framework globally.

```text
npm i serverless -g
```

Run `serverless` to verify your installation is working, and show the current version.

&lt;br/&gt;

## Update Serverless Framework

As of version 4, the Serverless Framework automatically updates itself and performs a check to do so every 24 hours.

You can force an update by running this command:

```text
serverless update
```

Or, you can set this environment variable:

```text
SERVERLESS_FRAMEWORK_FORCE_UPDATE=true
```

&lt;br/&gt;

## The `serverless` Command

The Serverless Framework ships with a `serverless` command that walks you through getting a project created and deployed onto AWS. It helps with downloading a Template, setting up AWS Credentials, setting up the Serverless Framework Dashboard, and more, while explaining each concept along the way.

This guide will also walk you through getting started with the Serverless Framework, but please note, simply typing the `serverless` command may be the superior experience.

```text
serverless
```

&lt;br/&gt;

## Create A Service

The primary concept for a project in the Serverless Framework is known as a &quot;Service&quot;, and its declared by a `serverless.yml` file, which contains simplified syntax for deploying cloud infrastructure, such as AWS Lambda functions, infrastructure that triggers those functions with events, and additional infrastructure your AWS Lambda functions may need for various use-cases (e.g. AWS DynamoDB database tables, AWS S3 storage buckets, AWS API Gateways for recieving HTTP requests and forwarding them to AWS Lambda).

A Service can either be an entire application, logic for a specific domain (e.g. &quot;blog&quot;, &quot;users&quot;, &quot;products&quot;), or a microservice handling one task. You decide how to organize your project. Generally, we recommend starting with a monolithic approach to everything to reduce complexity, until breaking up logic is absolutely necessary.

To create and fully set up a Serverless Framework Service, use the `serverless` command, which offers an interactive set-up workflow.

```text
serverless
```

This will show you several Templates. Choose one that fits the language and use-case you want.

```text
Serverless ϟ Framework
Welcome to Serverless Framework V.4

Create a new project by selecting a Template to generate scaffolding for a specific use-case.

? Select A Template: …
❯ AWS / Node.js / Starter
  AWS / Node.js / HTTP API
  AWS / Node.js / Scheduled Task
  AWS / Node.js / SQS Worker
  AWS / Node.js / Express API
  AWS / Node.js / Express API with DynamoDB
  AWS / Python / Starter
  AWS / Python / HTTP API
  AWS / Python / Scheduled Task
  AWS / Python / SQS Worker
  AWS / Python / Flask API
  AWS / Python / Flask API with DynamoDB
  (Scroll for more)
```

After selecting a Service Template, its files will be downloaded and you will have the opportunity to give your Service a name.

```text
? Name Your Service: ›
```

Please use only lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens. Also, keep Service names short, since they are added into the name of each cloud resource the Serverless Framework creates, and some cloud resources have character length restrictions in their names.

Learn more about Services and more in the [Core Concepts documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/intro).

&lt;br/&gt;

## Signing In

As of Serverless Framework V.4, if you are using the `serverless` command to set up a Service, it will eventually ask you to log in.

If you need to log in outside of that, run `serverless login`.

Logging in will redirect you to the [Serverless Framework Dashboard](https://app.serverless.com) within your browser. After registering or logging in, go back to your CLI and you will be signed in.

Please note, you can get up and running with the Serverless Framework CLI and Dashboard for free, and the CLI will always be free for small orgs and indiehackers. For more information on pricing, check out our [pricing page](https://serverless.com/pricing).

&lt;br/&gt;

## Creating An App

The &quot;App&quot; concept is a parent container for one or many &quot;Services&quot; which you can optionally set via the `app` property in your `serverless.yml`. Setting an `app` also enables Serverless Framework Dashboard features for that Service, like tracking your Services and their deployments in Serverless Framework Dashboard, enabling sharing outputs between them, sharing secrets between them, and enabling metrics, traces and logs.

If you are using the `serverless` onboarding command, it will help you set up an `app` and add it to your Service. You can use the `serverless` command to create an App on an existing Service as well, or create an App in the Dashboard.

```text
❯ Create A New App
  ecommerce
  blog
  acmeinc
  Skip Adding An App
```

The app can also be set manually in serverless.yml via the `app` property:

```yaml
service: my-service
app: my-app
```

If you don&#039;t want to use the Serverless Framework Dashboard&#039;s features, simply don&#039;t add an `app` property. Apps are not required.

&lt;br/&gt;

## Setting Up AWS Credentials

To deploy cloud infrastructure to AWS, you must give the Serverless Framework access to your AWS credentials.

Running the Serverless Framework&#039;s `serverless` command in a new or existing Service will help identify if AWS credentials have been set correctly or if they are expired, or help you set them up from scratch.

```text
No valid AWS Credentials were found in your environment variables or on your machine. Serverless Framework needs these to access your AWS account and deploy resources to it. Choose an option below to set up AWS Credentials.

❯ Create AWS IAM Role (Easy &amp; Recommended)
  Save AWS Credentials in a Local Profile
  Skip &amp; Set Later (AWS SSO, ENV Vars)
```

We recommend creating an AWS IAM Role that&#039;s stored in the Serverless Framework Dashboard. We&#039;ll be supporting a lot of Provider Credentials in the near future, and the Dashboard is a great place to keep these centralized across your team, helping you stay organized, and securely eliminating the need to keep credentials on the machines of your teammates.

If you are using AWS SSO, we recommend simply pasting your temporary SSO credentials within the terminal as environment variables.

To learn more about setting up your AWS Credentials, [read this guide](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials).

&lt;br/&gt;

## Deploy A Service

After you&#039;ve used the `serverless` command to set up everything, it&#039;s time to deploy your Service to AWS.

Make sure your terminal session is within the directory that contains your `serverless.yml` file. If you just created a Service, don&#039;t forget to `cd` into it.

```text
cd [your-new-service-name]
```

Deploying will create/update cloud infrastructure and code on AWS, all at the same time.

Run the `deploy` command:

```text
serverless deploy
```

More details on deploying can be found [here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/deploying).

&lt;br/&gt;

## Developing

Many Serverless Framework and serverless developers generally choose to develop on the cloud, since it matches reality (i.e. your production environment), and emulating Lambda and other infrastructure dependencies locally can be complex.

In Serverless Framework V.4, we&#039;ve created a _hybrid approach to development_, to help developers develop rapidly with the accuracy of the real cloud environment. This is the new `dev` command:

```text
serverless dev
```

When you run this command, the following happens...

An AWS Cloudformation deployment will happen to slightly modify all of the AWS Lambda functions within your Service so that they include a lightweight wrapper.

Once this AWS Cloudformation deployment has completed, your live AWS Lambda functions within your Service will still be able to receive events and be invoked within AWS.

However, the events will be securely and instantly proxied down to your machine, and the code on your machine which will be run, rather than the code within your live AWS Lambda functions.

This allows you to make changes to your code, without having to deploy or recreate every aspect of your architecture locally, allowing you to develop rapidly.

Logs from your local code will also be shown within your terminal `dev` session.

Once your code has finished, the response from your local code will be forwarded back up to your live AWS Lambda functions, and they will return the response—just like a normal AWS Lambda function in the cloud would.

Please note, `dev` is only designed for development or personal stages/environments and should not be run in production or any stage where a high volume of events are being processed.

Once you are finished with your `dev` session, you MUS

## Key Features

- [Workflows](#workflows) - Workflows run automations. Workflows are sequences of steps - pre-built actions or custom [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/), [Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/), [Golang](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/), or [Bash](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/) code - triggered by an event (HTTP request, timer, when a new row is added to a Google Sheets, and more).
- [Event Sources](#event-sources) - Sources trigger workflows. They emit events from services like GitHub, Slack, Airtable, RSS and [more](https://pipedream.com/apps). When you want to run a workflow when an event happens in any third-party app, you&#039;re using an event source.
- [Actions](#actions) - Actions are pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common operations across Pipedream&#039;s 1,000+ API integrations. For example, you can use actions to send email, add a row to a Google Sheet, [and more](https://pipedream.com/apps).
- [Custom code](#code) - Most integrations require custom logic. Code is often the best way to express that logic, so Pipedream allows you to run any [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/), [Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/), [Golang](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/), or [Bash](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/) code. You can import any package from the languages&#039; package managers, connect to any Pipedream connected app, and more. Pipedream is &quot;low-code&quot; in the best way: you can use pre-built components when you&#039;re performing common actions, but you can write custom code when you need to.
- [Destinations](#destinations) - Deliver events asynchronously to common destinations like Amazon S3, Snowflake, HTTP and email.
- [Free](#pricing) - No fees for individual developers (see [limits](https://docs.pipedream.com/limits/))

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

### Workflows

Workflows are sequences of linear [steps](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/steps) triggered by an event (like an HTTP request, or when a new row is added to a Google sheet). You can quickly develop complex automations using workflows and connect to any of our 1,000+ integrated apps.

[See our workflow quickstart](https://pipedream.com/docs/quickstart/) to get started.

### Event Sources

[Event Sources](https://pipedream.com/docs/sources/) watch for new data from services like GitHub, Slack, Airtable, RSS and [more](https://pipedream.com/apps). When a source finds a new event, it emits it, triggering any linked workflows.

You can also consume events emitted by sources using [Pipedream&#039;s REST API](https://pipedream.com/docs/api/rest/) or a private, real-time [SSE stream](https://pipedream.com/docs/api/sse/).

When a pre-built source doesn&#039;t exist for your use case, [you can build your own](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/quickstart/nodejs/sources/). Here is the simplest event source: it exposes an HTTP endpoint you can send any request to, and prints the contents of the request when invoked:

```javascript
export default {
  name: &quot;http&quot;,
  version: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,
  props: {
    http: &quot;$.interface.http&quot;,
  },
  run(event) {
    console.log(event); // event contains the method, payload, etc.
  },
};
```

&lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/sources/new?app=http&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/m0bBsSL/deploy-clean.png&quot; height=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You can find the code for all pre-built sources in [the `components` directory](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components). If you find a bug or want to contribute a feature, [see our contribution guide](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/guidelines/#process).

### Actions

[Actions](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/actions/) are pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common operations across Pipedream&#039;s 500+ API integrations. For example, you can use actions to send email, add a row to a Google Sheet, [and more](https://pipedream.com/apps).

You can [create your own actions](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/quickstart/nodejs/actions/), which you can re-use across workflows. You can also [publish actions to the entire Pipedream community](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/guidelines/), making them available for anyone to use.

Here&#039;s an action that accepts a `name` as input and prints it to the workflow&#039;s logs:

```javascript
export default {
  name: &quot;Action Demo&quot;,
  description: &quot;This is a demo action&quot;,
  key: &quot;action_demo&quot;,
  version: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,
  type: &quot;action&quot;,
  props: {
    name: {
      type: &quot;string&quot;,
      label: &quot;Name&quot;,
    },
  },
  async run() {
    return `hello ${this.name}!`;
  },
};
```

You can find the code for all pre-built actions in [the `components` directory](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components). If you find a bug or want to contribute a feature, [see our contribution guide](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/guidelines/#process).

### Custom code

Most integrations require custom logic. Code is often the best way to express that logic, so Pipedream allows you to run custom code in a workflow using:

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;Node.js&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1646761316/docs/icons/icons8-nodejs_aax6wn.svg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;Python&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1647356607/docs/icons/python-logo-generic_k3o5w2.svg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;Go&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1646763751/docs/icons/Go-Logo_Blue_zhkchv.svg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;Bash&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1647356698/docs/icons/full_colored_dark_1_-svg_vyfnv7.svg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

You can import any package from the languages&#039; package managers by declaring the imports directly in code. Pipedream will parse and download the necessary dependencies.

```javascript
// Node.js
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;
```

```python
# Python
import pandas as pd
```

```golang
// Go
import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    pd &quot;github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream-go&quot;
)
```

You can also [connect to any Pipedream connected app in custom code steps](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/auth/). For example, you can connect your Slack account and send a message to a channel:

```javascript
import { WebClient } from &quot;@slack/web-api&quot;;

export default defineComponent({
  props: {
    // This creates a connection called &quot;slack&quot; that connects a Slack account.
    slack: {
      type: &quot;app&quot;,
      app: &quot;slack&quot;,
    },
  },
  async run({ steps, $ }) {
    const web = new WebClient(this.slack.$auth.oauth_access_token);

    return await web.chat.postMessage({
      text: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;,
      channel: &quot;#general&quot;,
    });
  },
});
```

### Destinations

[Destinations](https://pipedream.com/docs/destinations/), like actions, abstract the connection, batching, and delivery logic required to send events to services like Amazon S3, or targets like HTTP and email.

For example, sending data to an Amazon S3 bucket is as simple as calling `$send.s3()`:

```javascript
$send.s3({
  bucket: &quot;your-bucket-here&quot;,
  prefix: &quot;your-prefix/&quot;,
  payload: event.body,
});
```

Pipedream supports the following destinations:

- [Amazon S3](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/s3/)
- [Snowflake](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/snowflake/)
- [HTTP](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/http/)
- [Email](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/email/)
- [SSE](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/sse/)

# Get Support

If you&#039;d like business to enterprise-level support from Rajeh, the current maintainer of Baileys, you can book a video chat. Book a 1 hour time slot by contacting him on Discord or pre-ordering [here](https://purpshell.dev/book). The earlier you pre-order the better, as his time slots usually fill up very quickly. He offers immense value per hour and will answer all your questions before the time runs out.

If you are a business, we encourage you to contribute back to the high development costs of the project and to feed the maintainers who dump tens of hours a week on this. You can do so by booking meetings or sponsoring below. All support, even in bona fide / contribution hours, is welcome by businesses of all sizes. This is not condoning or endorsing businesses to use the library. See the Disclaimer below.

- Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a **WebSocket**.
- Not running Selenium or Chromium saves you like **half a gig** of ram :/
- Baileys supports interacting with the multi-device &amp; web versions of WhatsApp.
- Thank you to [@pokearaujo](https://github.com/pokearaujo/multidevice) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Multi-Device. Also, thank you to [@Sigalor](https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Web and thanks to [@Rhymen](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/) for the __go__ implementation.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; The original repository had to be removed by the original author - we now continue development in this repository here.

## Connecting Account

WhatsApp provides a multi-device API that allows Baileys to be authenticated as a second WhatsApp client by scanning a **QR code** or **Pairing Code** with WhatsApp on your phone.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **[Here](#example-to-start) is a simple example of event handling**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **You can see all supported socket configs [here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/SocketConfig.html) (Recommended)**

### Starting socket with **QR-CODE**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can customize browser name if you connect with **QR-CODE**, with `Browser` constant, we have some browsers config, **see [here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/BrowsersMap.html)**

```ts
import makeWASocket from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    browser: Browsers.ubuntu(&#039;My App&#039;),
    printQRInTerminal: true
})
```

If the connection is successful, you will see a QR code printed on your terminal screen, scan it with WhatsApp on your phone and you&#039;ll be logged in!

### Starting socket with **Pairing Code**


&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Pairing Code isn&#039;t Mobile API, it&#039;s a method to connect Whatsapp Web without QR-CODE, you can connect only with one device, see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1324084875126592/?cms_platform=web)

The phone number can&#039;t have `+` or `()` or `-`, only numbers, you must provide country code

```ts
import makeWASocket from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    printQRInTerminal: false //need to be false
})

if (!sock.authState.creds.registered) {
    const number = &#039;XXXXXXXXXXX&#039;
    const code = await sock.requestPairingCode(number)
    console.log(code)
}
```

### Receive Full History

1. Set `syncFullHistory` as `true`
2. Baileys, by default, use chrome browser config
    - If you&#039;d like to emulate a desktop connection (and receive more message history), this browser setting to your Socket config:

```ts
const sock = makeWASocket({
    ...otherOpts,
    // can use Windows, Ubuntu here too
    browser: Browsers.macOS(&#039;Desktop&#039;),
    syncFullHistory: true
})
```

## Important Notes About Socket Config

### Caching Group Metadata (Recommended)
- If you use baileys for groups, we recommend you to set `cachedGroupMetadata` in socket config, you need to implement a cache like this:

    ```ts
    const groupCache = new NodeCache({stdTTL: 5 * 60, useClones: false})

    const sock = makeWASocket({
        cachedGroupMetadata: async (jid) =&gt; groupCache.get(jid)
    })

    sock.ev.on(&#039;groups.update&#039;, async ([event]) =&gt; {
        const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
        groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
    })

    sock.ev.on(&#039;group-participants.update&#039;, async (event) =&gt; {
        const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
        groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
    })
    ```

### Improve Retry System &amp; Decrypt Poll Votes
- If you want to improve sending message, retrying when error occurs and decrypt poll votes, you need to have a store and set `getMessage` config in socket like this:
    ```ts
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        getMessage: async (key) =&gt; await getMessageFromStore(key)
    })
    ```

### Receive Notifications in Whatsapp App
- If you want to receive notifications in whatsapp app, set `markOnlineOnConnect` to `false`
    ```ts
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        markOnlineOnConnect: false
    })
    ```
## Saving &amp; Restoring Sessions

You obviously don&#039;t want to keep scanning the QR code every time you want to connect.

So, you can load the credentials to log back in:
```ts
import makeWASocket, { useMultiFileAuthState } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState(&#039;auth_info_baileys&#039;)

// will use the given state to connect
// so if valid credentials are available -- it&#039;ll connect without QR
const sock = makeWASocket({ auth: state })

// this will be called as soon as the credentials are updated
sock.ev.on(&#039;creds.update&#039;, saveCreds)
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; `useMultiFileAuthState` is a utility function to help save the auth state in a single folder, this function serves as a good guide to help write auth &amp; key states for SQL/no-SQL databases, which I would recommend in any production grade system.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; When a message is received/sent, due to signal sessions needing updating, the auth keys (`authState.keys`) will update. Whenever that happens, you must save the updated keys (`authState.keys.set()` is called). Not doing so will prevent your messages from reaching the recipient &amp; cause other unexpected consequences. The `useMultiFileAuthState` function automatically takes care of that, but for any other serious implementation -- you will need to be very careful with the key state management.

## Handling Events

- Baileys uses the EventEmitter syntax for events.
They&#039;re all nicely typed up, so you shouldn&#039;t have any issues with an Intellisense editor like VS Code.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **The events are [these](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/BaileysEventMap.html)**, it&#039;s important you see all events

You can listen to these events like this:
```ts
const sock = makeWASocket()
sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.upsert&#039;, ({ messages }) =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;got messages&#039;, messages)
})
```

### Example to Start

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This example includes basic auth storage too

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; For reliable serialization of the authentication state, especially when storing as JSON, always use the BufferJSON utility.

```ts
import makeWASocket, { DisconnectReason, useMultiFileAuthState } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;
import { Boom } from &#039;@hapi/boom&#039;

async function connectToWhatsApp () {
    const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState(&#039;auth_info_baileys&#039;)
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        // can provide additional config here
        auth: state,
        printQRInTerminal: true
    })
    sock.ev.on(&#039;connection.update&#039;, (update) =&gt; {
        const { connection, lastDisconnect } = update
        if(connection === &#039;close&#039;) {
            const shouldReconnect = (lastDisconnect.error as Boom)?.output?.statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut
            console.log(&#039;connection closed due to &#039;, lastDisconnect.error, &#039;, reconnecting &#039;, shouldReconnect)
            // reconnect if not logged out
            if(shouldReconnect) {
                connectToWhatsApp()
            }
        } else if(connection === &#039;open&#039;) {
            console.log(&#039;opened connection&#039;)
        }
    })
    sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.upsert&#039;, event =&gt; {
        for (const m of event.messages) {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(m, undefined, 2))

            console.log(&#039;replying to&#039;, m.key.remoteJid)
            await sock.sendMessage(m.key.remoteJid!, { text: &#039;Hello Word&#039; })
        }
    })

    // to storage creds (session info) when it updates
    sock.ev.on(&#039;creds.update&#039;, saveCreds)
}
// run in main file
connectToWhatsApp()
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; In `messages.upsert` it&#039;s recommended to use a loop like `for (const message of event.messages)` to handle all messages in array

### Decrypt Poll Votes

- By default poll votes are encrypted and handled in `messages.update`
- That&#039;s a simple example
```ts
sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.update&#039;, event =&gt; {
    for(const { key, update } of event) {
        if(update.pollUpdates) {
            const pollCreation = await getMessage(key)
            if(pollCreation) {
                console.log(
                    &#039;got poll update, aggregation: &#039;,
                    getAggregateVotesInPollMessage({
                        message: pollCreation,
                        pollUpdates: update.pollUpdates,
                    })
                )
            }
        }
    }
})
```

- `getMessage` is a [store](#implementing-a-data-store) implementation (in your end)

### Summary of Events on First Connection

1. When you connect first time, `connection.update` will be fired requesting you to restart sock
2. Then, history messages will be received in `messaging.history-set`

## Implementing a Data Store

- Baileys does not come with a defacto storage for chats, contacts, or messages. However, a simple in-memory implementation has been provided. The store listens for chat updates, new messages, message updates, etc., to always have an up-to-date version of the data.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; I highly recommend building your own data store, as storing someone&#039;s entire chat history in memory is a terrible waste of RAM.

It can be used as follows:

```ts
import makeWASocket, { makeInMemoryStore } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;
// the store maintains the data of the WA connection in memory
// can be written out to a file &amp; read from it
const store = makeInMemoryStore({ })
// can be read from a file
store.readFromFile(&#039;./baileys_store.json&#039;)
// saves the state to a file every 10s
setInterval(() =&gt; {
    store.writeToFile(&#039;./baileys_store.json&#039;)
}, 10_000)

const sock = makeWASocket({ })
// will listen from this socket
// the store can listen from a new socket once the current socket outlives its lifetime
store.bind(sock.ev)

sock.ev.on(&#039;chats.upsert&#039;, () =&gt; {
    // can use &#039;store.chats&#039; however you want, even after the socket dies out
    // &#039;chats&#039; =&gt; a KeyedDB instance
    console.log(&#039;got chats&#039;, store.chats.all())
})

sock.ev.on(&#039;contacts.upsert&#039;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;got contacts&#039;, Object.values(store.contacts))
})

```

The store also provides some simple functions such as `loadMessages` that utilize the store to speed up data retrieval.

## Whatsapp IDs Explain

- `id` is the WhatsApp ID, called `jid` too, of the person or group you&#039;re sending the message to.
    - It must be in the format ```[country code][phone number]@s.whatsapp.net```
	    - Example for people: ```+19999999999@s.whatsapp.net```.

## Contribution Guides

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)

### References to issues/PRs

GitHub issues/PRs are usually referenced via `gh-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue/PR. You can find such an issue/PR under `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/NUMBER`.

jQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under [bugs.jquery.com](https://bugs.jquery.com/). It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern `trac-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under `https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/NUMBER`.

## Environments in which to use jQuery

- [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/)
- jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.

## What you need to build your own jQuery

To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

For Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.

## How to build your own jQuery

First, [clone the jQuery git repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Then, enter the jquery directory, install dependencies, and run the build script:

```bash
cd jquery
npm install
npm run build
```

The built version of jQuery will be placed in the `dist/` directory, along with a minified copy and associated map file.

## Build all jQuery release files

To build all variants of jQuery, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build:all
```

This will create all of the variants that jQuery includes in a release, including `jquery.js`, `jquery.slim.js`, `jquery.module.js`, and `jquery.slim.module.js` along their associated minified files and sourcemaps.

`jquery.module.js` and `jquery.slim.module.js` are [ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that export `jQuery` and `$` as named exports are placed in the `dist-module/` directory rather than the `dist/` directory.

## Building a Custom jQuery

The build script can be used to create a custom version of jQuery that includes only the modules you need.

Any module may be excluded except for `core`. When excluding `selector`, it is not removed but replaced with a small wrapper around native `querySelectorAll` (see below for more information).

### Build Script Help

To see the full list of available options for the build script, run the following:

```bash
npm run build -- --help
```

### Modules

To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the `src` folder (without the `.js` extension) to the `--exclude` option. When using the `--include` option, the default includes are dropped and a build is created with only those modules.

Some example modules that can be excluded or included are:

- **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.
- **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.
- **ajax/script**: The `&lt;script&gt;` AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.
- **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.
- **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).
- **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.
- **deprecated**: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.
- **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.
- **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(&quot;slow&quot;)`.
- **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.
- **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.
- **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.
- **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.
- **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(&quot;ready&quot;, ...)` or similar will not be triggered.
- **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.
- **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.
- **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.

- **selector**: The full jQuery selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced with a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser&#039;s `querySelectorAll` method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the [selector-native.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/src/selector-native.js) file for details.

*Note*: Excluding the full `selector` module will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as `effects/animatedSelector` and `css/hiddenVisibleSelectors`).

##### AMD name

You can set the module name for jQuery&#039;s AMD definition. By default, it is set to &quot;jquery&quot;, which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you&#039;d like to change this. Pass it to the `--amd` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --amd=&quot;custom-name&quot;
```

Or, to define anonymously, leave the name blank.

```bash
npm run build -- --amd
```

##### File name and directory

The default name for the built jQuery file is `jquery.js`; it is placed under the `dist/` directory. It&#039;s possible to change the file name using `--filename` and the directory using `--dir`. `--dir` is relative to the project root.

```bash
npm run build -- --slim --filename=&quot;jquery.slim.js&quot; --dir=&quot;/tmp&quot;
```

This would create a slim version of jQuery and place it under `tmp/jquery.slim.js`.

##### ECMAScript Module (ESM) mode

By default, jQuery generates a regular script JavaScript file. You can also generate an ECMAScript module exporting `jQuery` as the default export using the `--esm` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.module.js --esm
```

##### Factory mode

By default, jQuery depends on a global `window`. For environments that don&#039;t have one, you can generate a factory build that exposes a function accepting `window` as a parameter that you can provide externally (see [`README` of the published package](build/fixtures/README.md) for usage instructions). You can generate such a factory using the `--factory` parameter:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.js --factory
```

This option can be mixed with others like `--esm` or `--slim`:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.slim.module.js --factory --esm --slim --dir=&quot;/dist-module&quot;
```

#### Custom Build Examples

Create a custom build using `npm run build`, listing the modules to be excluded. Excluding a top-level module also excludes its corresponding directory of modules.

Exclude all **ajax** functionality:

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=ajax
```

Excluding **css** removes modules depending on CSS: **effects**, **offset**, **dimensions**.

```bash
npm run build -- --exclude=css
```

Exclude a bunch of modules (`-e` is an alias for `--exclude`):

```bash
npm run build -- -e ajax/jsonp -e css -e deprecated -e dimensions -e effects -e offset -e wrap
```

There is a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.js --slim
```

Or, to create the slim build as an esm module:

```bash
npm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.module.js --slim --esm
```

*Non-official custom builds are not regularly tested. Use them at your own risk.*

## Running the Unit Tests

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start `npm start` to auto-build jQuery as you work:

```bash
npm start
```

Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the &quot;test&quot; directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:

- Windows: [WAMP download](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
- Mac: [MAMP download](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
- Linux: [Setting up LAMP](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/easy-lamp-server-installation/)
- [Mongoose (most platforms)](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)

## Essential Git

As the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it&#039;s useful to know some features used.

### Cleaning

If you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you&#039;ve worked on is gone after these):

```bash
git reset --hard upstream/main
git clean -fdx
```

### Rebasing

For feature/topic branches, you should always use the `--rebase` flag to `git pull`, or if you are usually handling many temporary &quot;to be in a github pull request&quot; branches, run the following to automate this:

```bash
git config branch.autosetuprebase local
```

(see `man git-config` for more information)

### Handling merge conflicts

If you&#039;re getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature
`git mergetool`. Even though the default tool `xxdiff` looks awful/old, it&#039;s rather useful.

The following are some commands that can be used there:

- `Ctrl + Alt + M` - automerge as much as possible
- `b` - jump to next merge conflict
- `s` - change the order of the conflicted lines
- `u` - undo a merge
- `left mouse button` - mark a block to be the winner
- `middle mouse button` - mark a line to be the winner
- `Ctrl + S` - save
- `Ctrl + Q` - quit

## [QUnit](https://api.qunitjs.com) Reference

### Test methods

```js
expect( numAssertions );
stop();
start();
```

*Note*: QUnit&#039;s eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.

### Test assertions

```js
ok( value, [message] );
equal( actual, expected, [message] );
notEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
deepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
strictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
throws( block, [expected], [message] );
```

## Test Suite Convenience Methods Reference

See [test/data/testinit.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/test/data/testinit.js).

### Returns an array of elements with the given IDs

```js
q( ... );
```

Example:

```js
q( &quot;main&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; );

=&gt; [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]
```

### Asserts that a selection matches the given IDs

```js
t( testName, selector, [ &quot;array&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;ids&quot; ] );
```

Example:

```js
t(&quot;Check for something&quot;, &quot;//[a]&quot;, [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]);
```

### Fires a native DOM event without going through jQuery

```js
fireNative( node, eventType );
```

Example:

```js
fireNative( jQuery( &quot;#elem&quot; )[ 0 ], &quot;click&quot; );
```

### Add random number to url to stop caching

```js
url( &quot;some/url&quot; );
```

Example:

```js
url( &quot;index.html&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/index.html?10538358428943&quot;


url( &quot;mock.php?foo=bar&quot; );

=&gt; &quot;data/mock.php?foo=bar&amp;10538358345554&quot;
```

### Run tests in an iframe

Some tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and
these can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions
remain in jQuery&#039;s main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup
and setup code should be placed in the iframe file.

```js
testIframe( testName, fileName,
  function testCallback(
      assert, jQuery, window, document,
	  [ additional args ] ) {
	...
  } );
```

This loads a page, constructing a url with fileName `&quot;./data/&quot; + fileName`.
The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by
including the &quot;/test/data/iframeTest.js&quot; script and calling
`startIframeTest( [ additional args ] )` when appropriate. Often this
will be after either document ready or `window.onload` fires.

The `testCallback` receives the QUnit `assert` object created by `testIframe`
for this test, followed by the global `jQuery`, `window`, and `document` from
the iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to `startIframeTest`,
they follow the `document` argument.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

For information on using Node.js, see the [Node.js website][].

The Node.js project uses an [open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md). The
[OpenJS Foundation][] provides support for the project.

Contributors are expected to act in a collaborative manner to move
the project forward. We encourage the constructive exchange of contrary
opinions and compromise. The [TSC](./GOVERNANCE.md#technical-steering-committee)
reserves the right to limit or block contributors who repeatedly act in ways
that discourage, exhaust, or otherwise negatively affect other participants.

**This project has a [Code of Conduct][].**

## Support

Looking for help? Check out the
[instructions for getting support](.github/SUPPORT.md).

## Release types

* **Current**: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
  branch for its major version number (for example,
  [v22.x](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v22.x)). Node.js releases a new
  major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
  April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
  life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
  each October.
* **LTS**: Releases that receive Long Term Support, with a focus on stability
  and security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.
  LTS releases receive 12 months of _Active LTS_ support and a further 18 months
  of _Maintenance_. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered code names,
  beginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,
  except in some special circumstances.
* **Nightly**: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are
  changes. Use with caution.

Current and LTS releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). A
member of the Release Team [signs](#release-keys) each Current and LTS release.
For more information, see the
[Release README](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#readme).

### Download

Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
&lt;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&gt;.

#### Current and LTS releases

&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/release/&gt;

The [latest](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest/) directory is an
alias for the latest Current release. The latest-_codename_ directory is an
alias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the
[latest-hydrogen](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-hydrogen/)
directory contains the latest Hydrogen (Node.js 18) release.

#### Nightly releases

&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/&gt;

Each directory and filename includes the version (e.g., `v22.0.0`),
followed by the UTC date (e.g., `20240424` for April 24, 2024),
and the short commit SHA of the HEAD of the release (e.g., `ddd0a9e494`).
For instance, a full directory name might look like `v22.0.0-nightly20240424ddd0a9e494`.

#### API documentation

Documentation for the latest Current release is at &lt;https://nodejs.org/api/&gt;.
Version-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the
_docs_ subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at
&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/docs/&gt;.

### Verifying binaries

Download directories contain a `SHASUMS256.txt.asc` file with SHA checksums for the
files and the releaser PGP signature.

You can get a trusted keyring from nodejs/release-keys, e.g. using `curl`:

```bash
curl -fsLo &quot;/path/to/nodejs-keyring.kbx&quot; &quot;https://github.com/nodejs/release-keys/raw/HEAD/gpg/pubring.kbx&quot;
```

Alternatively, you can import the releaser keys in your default keyring, see
[Release keys](#release-keys) for commands to how to do that.

Then, you can verify the files you&#039;ve downloaded locally
(if you&#039;re using your default keyring, pass `--keyring=&quot;${GNUPGHOME:-~/.gnupg}/pubring.kbx&quot;`):

```bash
curl -fsO &quot;https://nodejs.org/dist/${VERSION}/SHASUMS256.txt.asc&quot; \
&amp;&amp; gpgv --keyring=&quot;/path/to/nodejs-keyring.kbx&quot; --output SHASUMS256.txt &lt; SHASUMS256.txt.asc \
&amp;&amp; shasum --check SHASUMS256.txt --ignore-missing
```

&lt;/div&gt;

## Overview
This user script unlocks and enables download of images, GIFs, audios, and videos in Telegram webapps from chats, stories, and even private channels where downloading is disabled or restricted.

(Note: some features are only available for specific Telegram webapp version. e.g. Audio message download is only available for the K webapp version.)

### What are user scripts?
User scripts put you in control of your  browsing experience. Once installed, they automatically make the sites you visit better by adding features, making them easier to use, or taking out the annoying bits. The user scripts on Greasy Fork were written by other users and posted to share with the world. They&#039;re free to install and easy to use.

## Installation

## How to Use
This script only works on Telegram Webapp.

For channels and chats that allow saving content, this script will have no effect. Please just use the official download button provided by the telegram webapp instead.

For channels and chats that disable downloading and restrict saving content, this script will add the download button back for images, GIFs and videos.

For videos, a progress bar will show on the bottom-right corder after you started downloading. For images and audios, there won&#039;t be a progress bar.

### Supported Webapp Versions
There are 2 different versions of telegram webapps:
- https://webk.telegram.org / https://web.telegram.org/k/ (**Recommended**)
- https://webz.telegram.org / https://web.telegram.org/a/

This script should work on both versions of webapp, but some features are only available in the /k/ version (such as voice message downloads). If certain features are not working, switching to the /k/ version is recommended.

### Check Downloading Progress
A progress bar will show on the bottom-right of the screen for videos. You can also check [DevTools console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) for logs.
