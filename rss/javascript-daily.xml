# What is Ripple?

&gt; Currently, this project is still in early development, and should not be used in production.

Ripple is a TypeScript UI framework that takes the best parts of React, Solid and Svelte and combines them into one package.

I wrote Ripple as a love letter for frontend web – and this is largely a project that I built in less than a week, so it&#039;s very raw.

Personally, I ([@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)) have been involved in some truly amazing frontend frameworks along their journeys – from [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno), where it all began, to [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and the journey of React Hooks, to creating [Lexical](https://github.com/facebook/lexical), to [Svelte 5](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and its new compiler and signal-based reactivity runtime. Along that journey, I collected ideas, and intriguing thoughts that may or may not pay off. Given my time between roles, I decided it was the best opportunity to try them out, and for open source to see what I was cooking.

Ripple was designed to be a JS/TS-first framework, rather than HTML-first. Ripple modules have their own `.ripple` extension and these modules
fully support TypeScript. By introducing a new extension, it affords Ripple to invent its own superset language, that plays really nicely with
TypeScript and JSX, but with a few interesting touches. In my experience, this has led to better DX not only for humans, but also for LLMs.

Right now, there will be plenty of bugs, things just won&#039;t work either and you&#039;ll find TODOs everywhere. At this stage, Ripple is more of an early alpha version of something that _might_ be, rather than something you should try and adopt. If anything, maybe some of the ideas can be shared and incubated back into other frameworks. There&#039;s also a lot of similarities with Svelte 5, and that&#039;s not by accident, that&#039;s because of my recent time working on Svelte 5.

- **Types**: The codebase is very raw with limited types, we&#039;re getting around to it

## Getting Started

### Try Ripple

&gt; We&#039;re working hard on getting an online playground available. Watch this space!

You can try Ripple now by using our basic Vite template either via [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/trueadm/ripple/tree/main/templates/basic), or by running these commands in your terminal:

```bash
npx degit trueadm/ripple/templates/basic my-app
cd my-app
npm i # or yarn or pnpm
npm run dev # or yarn or pnpm
```

## VSCode Extension

The [Ripple VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ripplejs.ripple-vscode-plugin) provides:

- **Syntax Highlighting** for `.ripple` files
- **Real-time Diagnostics** for compilation errors
- **TypeScript Integration** for type checking
- **IntelliSense** for autocompletion

You can find the extension on the VS Code Marketplace as [`Ripple for VS Code`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ripplejs.ripple-vscode-plugin).

You can also [manually install the extension](https://github.com/trueadm/ripple/raw/refs/heads/main/packages/ripple-vscode-plugin/published/ripple-vscode-plugin.vsix) `.vsix` that have been manually packaged.

### Mounting your app

You can use the `mount` API from the `ripple` package to render your Ripple component, using the `target`
option to specify what DOM element you want to render the component.

```ts
// index.ts
import { mount } from &#039;ripple&#039;;
import { App } from &#039;/App.ripple&#039;;

mount(App, {
  props: {
    title: &#039;Hello world!&#039;,
  },
  target: document.getElementById(&#039;root&#039;),
});
```

## Key Concepts

### Components

Define reusable components with the `component` keyword. These are similar to functions in that they have `props`, but crucially,
they allow for a JSX-like syntax to be defined alongside standard TypeScript. That means you do not _return JSX_ like in other frameworks,
but you instead use it like a JavaScript statement, as shown:

```jsx
component Button(props: { text: string, onClick: () =&gt; void }) {
  &lt;button onClick={props.onClick}&gt;
    {props.text}
  &lt;/button&gt;
}

// Usage
export component App() {
  &lt;Button text=&quot;Click me&quot; onClick={() =&gt; console.log(&quot;Clicked!&quot;)} /&gt;
}
```

Ripple&#039;s templating language also supports shorthands and object spreads too:

```svelte
// you can do a normal prop
&lt;div onClick={onClick}&gt;{text}&lt;/div&gt;

// or using the shorthand prop
&lt;div {onClick}&gt;{text}&lt;/div&gt;

// and you can spread props
&lt;div {...properties}&gt;{text}&lt;/div&gt;
```

### Reactive Variables

Variables prefixed with `$` are automatically reactive:

```ts
let $name = &#039;World&#039;;
let $count = 0;

// Updates automatically trigger re-renders
$count++;
```

Object properties prefixed with `$` are also automatically reactive:

```ts
let counter = { $current: 0 };

// Updates automatically trigger re-renders
counter.$current++;
```

Derived values are simply `$` variables that combined different parts of state:

```ts
let $count = 0;
let $double = $count * 2;
let $quadruple = $double * 2;
```

That means `$count` itself might be derived if it were to reference another reactive property. For example:

```jsx
component Counter({ $startingCount }) {
  let $count = $startingCount;
  let $double = $count * 2;
  let $quadruple = $double * 2;
}
```

Now given `$startingCount` is reactive, it would mean that `$count` might reset each time an incoming change to `$startingCount` occurs. That might not be desirable, so Ripple provides a way to `untrack` reactivity in those cases:

```jsx
import { untrack } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

component Counter({ $startingCount }) {
  let $count = untrack(() =&gt; $startingCount);
  let $double = $count * 2;
  let $quadruple = $double * 2;
}
```

Now `$count` will only reactively create its value on initialization.

&gt; Note: you cannot define reactive variables in module/global scope, they have to be created on access from an active component

#### Transporting Reactivity

Ripple doesn&#039;t constrain reactivity to components only. Reactivity can be used inside other functions (and classes in the future) and be composed in a way to improve expressitivity and co-location.

Ripple provides a very nice way to transport reactivity between boundaries so that it&#039;s persisted – using objects and arrays. Here&#039;s an example using arrays to transport reactivity:

```jsx
import { effect } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

function createDouble([ $count ]) {
  const $double = $count * 2;

  effect(() =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;Count:&#039;, $count)
  });

  return [ $double ];
}

export component App() {
  let $count = 0;

  const [ $double ] = createDouble([ $count ]);

  &lt;div&gt;{&#039;Double: &#039; + $double}&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; { $count++; }}&gt;{&#039;Increment&#039;}&lt;/button&gt;
}
```

You can do the same with objects too:

```jsx
import { effect } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

function createDouble({ $count }) {
  const $double = $count * 2;

  effect(() =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;Count:&#039;, $count)
  });

  return { $double };
}

export component App() {
  let $count = 0;
  const { $double } = createDouble({ $count });

  &lt;div&gt;{&#039;Double: &#039; + $double}&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; { $count++; }}&gt;{&#039;Increment&#039;}&lt;/button&gt;
}
```

Just remember, reactive state must be connected to a component and it can&#039;t be global or created within the top-level of a module – because then Ripple won&#039;t be able to link it to your component tree.

#### Reactive Arrays

Just like, objects, you can use the `$` prefix in an array literal to specify that the field is reactive.

```js
let $first = 0;
let $second = 0;
const arr = [$first, $second];

const $total = arr.reduce((a, b) =&gt; a + b, 0);
```

Like shown in the above example, you can compose normal arrays with reactivity and pass them through props or boundaries.

However, if you need the entire array to be fully reactive, including when
new elements get added, you should use the reactive array that Ripple provides.

You&#039;ll need to import the `RippleArray` class from Ripple. It extends the standard JS `Array` class, and supports all of its methods and properties.

```js
import { RippleArray } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

// using the new constructor
const arr = new RippleArray(1, 2, 3);

// using static from method
const arr = Ripple.from([1, 2, 3]);

// using static of method
const arr = Ripple.of(1, 2, 3);
```

The `RippleArray` is a reactive array, and that means you can access properties normally using numeric index. However,
accessing the `length` property of a `RippleArray` will be not be reactive, instead you should use `$length`.

#### Reactive Set

The `RippleSet` extends the standard JS `Set` class, and supports all of its methods and properties. However,
accessing the `size` property of a `RippleSet` will be not be reactive, instead you should use `$size`.

```js
import { RippleSet } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

const set = new RippleSet([1, 2, 3]);
```

RippleSet&#039;s reactive methods or properties can be used directly or assigned to reactive variables.

```jsx
import { RippleSet } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

export component App() {
  const set = new RippleSet([1, 2, 3]);

  // direct usage
  &lt;p&gt;{&quot;Direct usage: set contains 2: &quot;}{set.has(2)}&lt;/p&gt;

  // reactive assignment with prefixed `$`
  let $has = set.has(2);
  &lt;p&gt;{&quot;Assigned usage: set contains 2: &quot;}{$has}&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; set.delete(2)}&gt;{&quot;Delete 2&quot;}&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; set.add(2)}&gt;{&quot;Add 2&quot;}&lt;/button&gt;
}
```

#### Reactive Map

The `RippleMap` extends the standard JS `Map` class, and supports all of its methods and properties. However,
accessing the `size` property of a `RippleMap` will be not be reactive, instead you should use `$size`.

```js
import { RippleMap } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

const map = new RippleMap([[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4]]);
```

RippleMap&#039;s reactive methods or properties can be used directly or assigned to reactive variables.

```jsx
import { RippleMap } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

export component App() {
  const map = new RippleMap([[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4]]);

  // direct usage
  &lt;p&gt;{&quot;Direct usage: map has an item with key 2: &quot;}{map.has(2)}&lt;/p&gt;

  // reactive assignment with prefixed `$`
  let $has = map.has(2);
  &lt;p&gt;{&quot;Assigned usage: map has an item with key 2: &quot;}{$has}&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; map.delete(2)}&gt;{&quot;Delete item with key 2&quot;}&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; map.set(2, 2)}&gt;{&quot;Add key 2 with value 2&quot;}&lt;/button&gt;
}
```

### Effects

When dealing with reactive state, you might want to be able to create side-effects based upon changes that happen upon updates.
To do this, you can use `effect`:

```jsx
import { effect } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

export component App() {
  let $count = 0;

  effect(() =&gt; {
    console.log($count);
  });

  &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; $count++}&gt;{&#039;Increment&#039;}&lt;/button&gt;
}
```

### Control flow

The JSX-like syntax might take some time to get used to if you&#039;re coming from another framework. For one, templating in Ripple
can only occur _inside_ a `component` body – you can&#039;t create JSX inside functions, or assign it to variables as an expression.

```jsx
&lt;div&gt;
  // you can create variables inside the template!
  const str = &quot;hello world&quot;;

  console.log(str); // and function calls too!

  debugger; // you can put breakpoints anywhere to help debugging!

  {str}
&lt;/div&gt;
```

Note that strings inside the template need to be inside `{&quot;string&quot;}`, you can&#039;t do `&lt;div&gt;hello&lt;/div&gt;` as Ripple
has no idea if `hello` is a string or maybe some JavaScript code that needs evaluating, so just ensure you wrap them
in curly braces. This shouldn&#039;t be an issue in the real-world anyway, as you&#039;ll likely use an i18n library that means
using JavaScript expressions regardless.

### If statements

If blocks work seamlessly with Ripple&#039;s templating language, you can put them inside the JSX-like
statements, making control-flow far easier to read and reason with.

```jsx
component Truthy({ x }) {
  &lt;div&gt;
    if (x) {
      &lt;span&gt;{&#039;x is truthy&#039;}&lt;/span&gt;
    } else {
      &lt;span&gt;{&#039;x is falsy&#039;}&lt;/span&gt;
    }
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
```

### For statements

You can render collections using a `for...of` block, and you don&#039;t need to specify a `key` prop like
other frameworks.

```jsx
component ListView({ title, items }) {
  &lt;h2&gt;{title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    for (const item of items) {
      &lt;li&gt;{item.text}&lt;/li&gt;
    }
  &lt;/ul&gt;
}
```

You can use Ripple&#039;s reactive arrays to easily compose contents of an array.

```jsx
import { RippleArray } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

component Numbers() {
  const items = new RippleArray(1, 2, 3);

  for (const item of items) {
    &lt;div&gt;{item}&lt;/div&gt;
  }

  &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; items.push(`Item ${items.$length + 1}`)}&gt;{&quot;Add Item&quot;}&lt;/button&gt;
}
```

Clicking the `&lt;button&gt;` will create a new item, note that `items` is not `$` prefixed, because it&#039;s not
reactive, but rather its properties are instead.

### Try statements

Try blocks work to build the foundation for **error boundaries**, when the runtime encounters
an error in the `try` block, you can easily render a fallback in the `catch` block.

```jsx
import { reportError } from &#039;some-library&#039;;

component ErrorBoundary() {
  &lt;div&gt;
    try {
      &lt;ComponentThatFails /&gt;
    } catch (e) {
      reportError(e);

      &lt;div&gt;{&#039;An error occurred! &#039; + e.message}&lt;/div&gt;
    }
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
```

### Props

If you want a prop to be reactive, you should also give it a `$` prefix.

```jsx
component Button(props: { $text: string, onClick: () =&gt; void }) {
  &lt;button onClick={props.onClick}&gt;
    {props.$text}
  &lt;/button&gt;
}

// Usage
&lt;Button $text={some_text} onClick={() =&gt; console.log(&quot;Clicked!&quot;)} /&gt;
```

This also applies to DOM elements, if you want an attribute or property to be reactive, it needs to have a `$` prefix.

```tsx
&lt;div $class={props.$someClass} $id={$someId}&gt;
  {$someText}
&lt;/div&gt;
```

Otherwise changes to the attribute or property will not be reactively updated.

### Children

Use `$children` prop and then use it in the form of `&lt;$children /&gt;` for component composition.

When you pass in children to a component, it gets implicitly passed as the `$children` prop, in the form of a component.

```jsx
import type { Component } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

component Card(props: { $children: Component }) {
  &lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
    &lt;props.$children /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
}

// Usage
&lt;Card&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;{&quot;Card content here&quot;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/Card&gt;
```

You could also explicitly write the same code as shown:

```jsx
import type { Component } from &#039;ripple&#039;;

component Card(props: { $children: Component }) {
  &lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
    &lt;props.$children /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
}

// Usage with explicit component
&lt;Card&gt;
  component $children() {
    &lt;p&gt;{&quot;Card content here&quot;}&lt;/p&gt;
  }
&lt;/Card&gt;
```

### Accessor Props

When working with props on composite components (`&lt;Foo&gt;` rather than `&lt;div&gt;`), it can sometimes be difficult to debug why a certain value is a certain way. JavaScript gives us a way to do this on objects using the `get` syntax:

```js
let name = &#039;Bob&#039;;

const object = {
  get name() {
    // I can easily debug when this property gets
    // access and track it easily
    console.log(name);
    return name;
  }
}
```

So Ripple provides similar capabilities when working with composite components in a template, specifcally using `$prop:={}` rather than the typical `$prop={}`.

In fact, when you use an accessor, you must pass a function, and the prop must be `$` prefixed, as Ripple considers accessor props as reactive:

```jsx
let $name = &#039;Bob&#039;;

const getName = () =&gt; {
  // I can easily debug when this property gets
  // access and track it easily
  console.log(name);
  return $name;
};

&lt;Person $name:={getName} /&gt;
```

You can also inline the function too:

```jsx
let $name = &#039;Bob&#039;;

&lt;Person $name:={() =&gt; {
  // I can easily debug when this property gets
  // access and track it easily
  console.log(name);
  return $name;
}} /&gt;
```

Furthermore, just like property accessors in JavaScript, Ripple provides a way of capturing the `set` too, enabling two-way data-flow on composite component props. You just need to provide a second function after the first, separated using a comma:

```jsx
let $name = &#039;Bob&#039;;

const getName = () =&gt; {
  return $name;
}

const setName = (newName) =&gt; {
  $name = newName;
}

&lt;Person $name:={getName, setName} /&gt;
```

Or an inlined version:

```jsx
let $name = &#039;Bob&#039;;

&lt;Person $name:={() =&gt; $name, (newName) =&gt; $name = $newName} /&gt;
```

Now changes in the `Person` to its `props` will propagate to its parent component:

```jsx
component Person(props) {
  const updateName = (newName) =&gt; {
    props.$name = newName;
  }

  &lt;NameInput onChange={updateName}&gt;
}
```

### Decorators

Ripple provides a consistent way to capture the underlying DOM element – decorators. Specifically, using
the syntax `{@use fn}` where `fn` is a function that captures the DOM element. If you&#039;re familiar with other frameworks, then
this is identical to `{@attach fn}` in Svelte 5 and somewhat similar to `ref` in React. The hook function will receive
the reference to the underlying DOM element.

```jsx
export component App() {
  let $node;

  const ref = (node) =&gt; {
    $node = node;
    console.log(&quot;mounted&quot;, node);

    return () =&gt; {
      $node = undefined;
      console.log(&quot;unmounted&quot;, node);
    };
  };

  &lt;div {@use ref}&gt;{&quot;Hello world&quot;}&lt;/div&gt;
}
```

You can also create `{@use}` functions inline.

```jsx
export component App() {
  let $node;

  &lt;div {@use (node) =&gt; {
    $node = node;
    return () =&gt; $node = null;
  }}&gt;{&quot;Hello world&quot;}&lt;/div&gt;
}
```

You can also use function factories to define properties, these are functions that return functions that do the same
thing. However, you can use this pattern to pass reactive properties.

```jsx
import { fadeIn } from &#039;some-library&#039;;

export component App({ $ms }) {
  &lt;div {@use fadeIn({ $ms })}&gt;{&quot;Hello world&quot;}&lt;/div&gt;
}
```

Lastly, you can use decorators on composite components.

```jsx
&lt;Image {@use (node) =&gt; console.log(node)} {...props} /&gt;
```

When passing decorators to composite components (rather than HTML elements) as shown above, they will be passed a `Symbol` property, as they are not named. This still means that it can be spread to HTML template elements later on, and still work.

### Event Props

Like React, events are props that start with `on` and then continue with an uppercase character, such as:

- `onClick`
- `onPointerMove`
- `onPointerDown`
- `onKeyDown`

For `capture` phase events, just add `Capture` to the end of the prop name:

- `onClickCapture`
- `onPointerMoveCapture`
- `onPointerDownCapture`
- `onKeyDownCapture`

&gt; Note: Some events are automatically delegated where possible by Ripple to improve runtime performance.

### Styling

Ripple supports native CSS styling that is localize

[![Versions](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/monaco-editor/next)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor)
[![Feature Requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/microsoft/monaco-editor/feature-request.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)

The Monaco Editor is the fully featured code editor from [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). Check out the [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) to see some of the supported features.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5047891/94183711-290c0780-fea3-11ea-90e3-c88ff9d21bd6.png)

## Try it out

Try out the editor and see various examples [in our interactive playground](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/playground.html).

The playground is the best way to learn about how to use the editor, which features is supports, to try out different versions and to create minimal reproducible examples for bug reports.

## Installing

```
&gt; npm install monaco-editor
```

You will get:

- inside `/esm`: ESM version of the editor (compatible with e.g. webpack)
- `monaco.d.ts`: this specifies the API of the editor (this is what is actually versioned, everything else is considered private and might break with any release).

:warning: The monaco editor also ships an `AMD` build for backwards-compatibility reasons, but the `AMD` support is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.

## Concepts

Monaco editor is best known for being the text editor that powers VS Code. However, it&#039;s a bit more nuanced. Some basic understanding about the underlying concepts is needed to use Monaco editor effectively.

### Models

Models are at the heart of Monaco editor. It&#039;s what you interact with when managing content. A model represents a file that has been opened. This could represent a file that exists on a file system, but it doesn&#039;t have to. For example, the model holds the text content, determines the language of the content, and tracks the edit history of the content.

### URIs

Each model is identified by a URI. This is why it&#039;s not possible for two models to have the same URI. Ideally when you represent content in Monaco editor, you should think of a virtual file system that matches the files your users are editing. For example, you could use `file:///` as a base path. If a model is created without a URI, its URI will be `inmemory://model/1`. The number increases as more models are created.

### Editors

An editor is a user facing view of the model. This is what gets attached to the DOM and what your users see visually. Typical editor operations are displaying a model, managing the view state, or executing actions or commands.

### Providers

Providers provide smart editor features. For example, this includes completion and hover information. It is not the same as, but often maps to [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) features.

Providers work on models. Some smart features depends on the file URI. For example, for TypeScript to resolve imports, or for JSON IntelliSense to determine which JSON schema to apply to which model. So it&#039;s important to choose proper model URIs.

### Disposables

Many Monaco related objects often implement the `.dispose()` method. This method is intended to perform cleanups when a resource is no longer needed. For example, calling `model.dispose()` will unregister it, freeing up the URI for a new model. Editors should be disposed to free up resources and remove their model listeners.

## Documentation

- Learn how to integrate the editor with these [complete samples](./samples/).
  - [Integrate the ESM version](./docs/integrate-esm.md)
- Learn how to use the editor API and try out your own customizations in the [playground](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/playground.html).
- Explore the [API docs](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/docs.html) or read them straight from [`monaco.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/gh-pages/node_modules/monaco-editor/monaco.d.ts).
- Read [this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/wiki/Accessibility-Guide-for-Integrators) to ensure the editor is accessible to all your users!
- Create a Monarch tokenizer for a new programming language [in the Monarch playground](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/monarch.html).
- Ask questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/monaco-editor)! Search open and closed issues, there are a lot of tips in there!

## Issues

## FAQ

❓ **What is the relationship between VS Code and the Monaco Editor?**

The Monaco Editor is generated straight from VS Code&#039;s sources with some shims around services the code needs to make it run in a web browser outside of its home.

❓ **What is the relationship between VS Code&#039;s version and the Monaco Editor&#039;s version?**

None. The Monaco Editor is a library and it reflects directly the source code.

❓ **I&#039;ve written an extension for VS Code, will it work on the Monaco Editor in a browser?**

No.

&gt; Note: If the extension is fully based on the [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and if the language server is authored in JavaScript, then it would be possible.

❓ **Why all these web workers and why should I care?**

Language services create web workers to compute heavy stuff outside of the UI thread. They cost hardly anything in terms of resource overhead and you shouldn&#039;t worry too much about them, as long as you get them to work (see above the cross-domain case).

❓ **I see the warning &quot;Could not create web worker&quot;. What should I do?**

HTML5 does not allow pages loaded on `file://` to create web workers. Please load the editor with a web server on `http://` or `https://` schemes.

❓ **Is the editor supported in mobile browsers or mobile web app frameworks?**

No.

❓ **Why doesn&#039;t the editor support TextMate grammars?**

- Please see https://github.com/bolinfest/monaco-tm which puts together `monaco-editor`, `vscode-oniguruma` and `vscode-textmate` to get TM grammar support in the editor.

&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bluewavelabs.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Checkmate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An open source uptime and infrastructure monitoring application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img width=&quot;1660&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b748f36d-a271-4965-ad0a-18bf153bbee7&quot; /&gt;

This repository contains both the frontend and the backend of Checkmate, an open-source, self-hosted monitoring tool for tracking server hardware, uptime, response times, and incidents in real-time with beautiful visualizations. Checkmate regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services&#039; availability, downtime, and response time.

Checkmate also has an agent, called [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture), to retrieve data from remote servers. While Capture is not required to run Checkmate, it provides additional insights about your servers&#039; CPU, RAM, disk, and temperature status. Capture can run on Linux, Windows, Mac, Raspberry Pi, or any device that can run Go.

Checkmate has been stress-tested with 1000+ active monitors without any particular issues or performance bottlenecks.

## User&#039;s guide

Usage instructions can be found [here](https://docs.checkmate.so/checkmate-2.1). It&#039;s still WIP and some of the information there might be outdated as we continuously add features weekly. Rest assured, we are doing our best! :)

## Installation

See installation instructions in [Checkmate documentation portal](https://docs.checkmate.so/checkmate-2.1/users-guide/quickstart). 

Alternatively, you can also use [Coolify](https://coolify.io/), [Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/checkmate), [K8s](./charts/helm/checkmate/INSTALLATION.md) or [Pikapods](https://www.pikapods.com/) to quickly spin off a Checkmate instance. If you would like to monitor your server infrastructure, you&#039;ll need [Capture agent](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture). Capture repository also contains the installation instructions.

### Using a Custom CA

If you need to monitor internal HTTPS endpoints with certificates from private Certificate Authorities (like Smallstep), see our [Custom CA Trust Guide](./docs/custom-ca-trust.md) for Docker configuration options.

For more documentation, see the [docs directory](./docs/).

## Performance

Thanks to extensive optimizations, Checkmate operates with an exceptionally small memory footprint, requiring minimal memory and CPU resources. Here’s the memory usage of a Node.js instance running on a server that monitors 323 servers every minute:

## Deployment

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; You **cannot** deploy to static web hosts, including Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, and GitHub Pages.

### Password Protection

1. Go to the `config.js` file and set `challenge` to **true**. Then, set the environment variable as follows:
2. For PNPM: Run either `config=true pnpm start` or `$env:config=true; pnpm start`, depending on your server.
3. For Bun: Run either `config=true bun start` or `$env:config=true; bun start` if you prefer Bun.
4. For NPM: Run either `config=true npm start` or `$env:config=true; npm start` if you prefer NPM.


### Server Deployment

You must run these commands on your server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar
cd Interstellar
```

#### Ad-Free Deployment

```bash
git clone --branch Ad-Free https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar
cd Interstellar
```

Next depending on your package manager, run one of the following commands:

#### Bun

If you are using Bun, run the following commands:

```bash
bun i
bun start
```

#### pnpm

If you are using pnpm, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

#### npm

If you are using npm, run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

### Updating

```bash
cd Interstellar
git pull --force --allow-unrelated-histories # This may overwrite your local changes
```

### Deployment Alternatives

For more deployment options, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/interstellar) for various ways to deploy Interstellar.
This includes methods of deploying to Render/OnRender.

#### What happened to Replit Deployment?

As of January 1st, 2024, Replit is [no longer free](https://blog.replit.com/hosting-changes). Try GitHub Codespaces instead.

### GitHub Codespaces

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re setting the port below 1023, then you must run `sudo PORT=1023`

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven&#039;t already.
2. Click &quot;Code&quot; (green button) and then &quot;Create Codespace on main.&quot;
3. In the terminal at the bottom, paste `pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm start`.
4. Respond to the application popup by clicking &quot;Make public.&quot;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Make sure you click the &quot;Make public.&quot; button, or the proxy won&#039;t function properly.&lt;br&gt;
&gt; If you get a Range Error, go back and make sure you clicked Make public!
5. Access the deployed website from the ports tab.
6. For subsequent uses in the same codespace, just run `pnpm start`

### Solution for if there is no popup.

1. Run `pnpm i`, and before `pnpm start`, prepend `PORT=8080`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `PORT=6969 pnpm start`.
2. If this does not work then you can prepend `$env:PORT=8080;`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `$env:PORT=6969; pnpm start`
3. Go to the ports tab, Click Forward A Port, And type the port number.
4. Right-click Visibility and set Port Visibility to Public.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We are committed to making Interstellar easy and personalized however, as of now we need your support in making it ad-free. Consider keeping ads so Interstellar can run freely or contribute by being a supporter.

## Introduction
[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

## General
**👉🏼 Want to score an easy open-source contribution?** Check out our [Good first issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) label.

**🕰️ Looking for the older version of Swagger UI?** Refer to the [*2.x* branch](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x).


This repository publishes three different NPM modules:

* [swagger-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc.).
* [swagger-ui-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that can&#039;t resolve npm module dependencies.
* [swagger-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-react) is Swagger UI packaged as a React component for use in React applications.

We strongly suggest that you use `swagger-ui` instead of `swagger-ui-dist` if you&#039;re building a single-page application, since `swagger-ui-dist` is significantly larger.

If you are looking for plain ol&#039; HTML/JS/CSS, [download the latest release](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest) and copy the contents of the `/dist` folder to your server.


## Compatibility
The OpenAPI Specification has undergone 5 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  Compatibility between Swagger UI and the OpenAPI Specification is as follows:

| Swagger UI Version | Release Date | OpenAPI Spec compatibility                           | Notes                                                                 |

## Anonymized analytics

SwaggerUI uses [Scarf](https://scarf.sh/) to collect [anonymized installation analytics](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-what-information-does-scarf-js-send-about-me). These analytics help support the maintainers of this library and ONLY run during installation. To [opt out](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-how-can-i-opt-out-of-analytics), you can set the `scarfSettings.enabled` field to `false` in your project&#039;s `package.json`:

```
// package.json
{
  // ...
  &quot;scarfSettings&quot;: {
    &quot;enabled&quot;: false
  }
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `SCARF_ANALYTICS` to `false` as part of the environment that installs your npm packages, e.g., `SCARF_ANALYTICS=false npm install`.

***

Appium is an open-source automation framework that provides
[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)-based automation possibilities for a wide range of
different mobile, desktop and IoT platforms. Appium is modular and extensible, and supports multiple
programming languages, which means there is an entire ecosystem of related software:
* [__Drivers__](#drivers) add support for automating specific platforms
* [__Clients__](#clients) allow writing Appium tests in your programming language of choice
* [__Plugins__](#plugins) allow to further extend Appium functionality

## Upgrading From Older Versions

The Appium team only provides support for the most recent version of Appium. If you wish to upgrade from
an older major Appium version, please refer to the migration guides:

* [Appium v2 to v3](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/guides/migrating-2-to-3/)
* [Appium v1 to v2](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/guides/migrating-1-to-2/)

## Installation

Appium can be installed using `npm` (other package managers are not currently supported). Please
check the [installation docs](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/quickstart/install/) for the
system requirements and further information.

If upgrading from Appium 1, make sure Appium 1 is fully uninstalled (`npm uninstall -g appium`).
Unexpected errors might appear if this has not been done.

```bash
npm i -g appium
```

Note that this will only install the core Appium server, which cannot automate anything on its own.
Please install [drivers](#drivers) for your target platforms in order to automate them.

## Drivers

Appium supports app automation across a variety of platforms, like iOS, Android, macOS, Windows,
and more. Each platform is supported by one or more &quot;drivers&quot;, which know how to automate that
particular platform. You can find a full list of officially-supported and third-party drivers in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Drivers page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/drivers/).

Driver management is done using [Appium&#039;s Extension command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/extensions/):

```bash
# Install an official driver from npm (see documentation for a list of such drivers)
appium driver install &lt;driver-name&gt;
# Install any driver from npm
appium driver install --source=npm &lt;driver-name&gt;
# See documentation for installation from other sources

# List already installed drivers
appium driver list --installed
# Update a driver (it must be already installed)
# This will NOT update the major version, in order to prevent breaking changes
appium driver update &lt;driver-name&gt;
# Update a driver to the most recent version (may include breaking changes)
appium driver update &lt;driver-name&gt; --unsafe
# Uninstall a driver (it won&#039;t last forever, will it?)
appium driver uninstall &lt;driver-name&gt;
```

## Clients

Client libraries enable writing Appium tests in different programming languages. There are
officially-supported clients for Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET C#, as well as third-party clients
for other languages. You can find a full list of clients in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Clients page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/clients/).

## Plugins

Plugins allow you to extend server functionality without changing the server code. The main
difference between drivers and plugins is that the latter must be explicitly enabled on
Appium server startup (all installed drivers are enabled by default):

```bash
appium --use-plugins=&lt;plugin-name&gt;
```

You can find a full list of officially-supported and third-party plugins in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Plugins page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/plugins/).

Similarly to drivers, plugin management is also done using
[Appium&#039;s Extension command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/extensions/):

```bash
# Install an official plugin from npm (see documentation for a list of such plugins)
appium plugin install &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# Install any plugin from npm
appium plugin install --source=npm &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# See documentation for installation from other sources

# List already installed plugins
appium plugin list --installed
# Update a plugin (it must be already installed)
# This will NOT update the major version, in order to prevent breaking changes
appium plugin update &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# Update a plugin to the most recent version (may include breaking changes)
appium plugin update &lt;plugin-name&gt; --unsafe
# Uninstall a plugin
appium plugin uninstall &lt;plugin-name&gt;
```

## Server Command Line Interface

In order to start sending commands to the Appium server, it must be running on the URL and port
where your client library expects it to listen. [Appium&#039;s command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/server/)
is used to launch and configure the server:

```bash
# Start the server on the default host (0.0.0.0) and port (4723)
appium server
# You can also omit the &#039;server&#039; subcommand
appium
# Start the server on the given host, port and use a custom base path prefix (the default prefix is &#039;/&#039;)
appium --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9000 --base-path /wd/hub
```

Appium supports execution of parallel server processes, as well as parallel driver sessions within a
single server process. Refer the corresponding driver documentations regarding which mode is optimal
for the particular driver or whether it supports parallel sessions.

## Why Appium?

1. You usually don&#039;t have to recompile your app or modify it in any way, due to the use of standard
   automation APIs on all platforms.
2. You can write tests with your favorite dev tools using any WebDriver-compatible language such as
   Java, Python, Ruby and C#. There are also third party client implementations for other languages.
3. You can use any testing framework.
4. Some drivers like `xcuitest` and `uiautomator2` have built-in mobile web and hybrid app support.
   Within the same script, you can switch seamlessly between native app automation and webview
   automation, all using the WebDriver model that&#039;s already the standard for web automation.
5. You can run your automated tests locally and in a cloud. There are multiple cloud providers that
   support various Appium drivers (mostly targeting iOS and Android mobile automation).
6. [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector) can be used to visually inspect
   the page source of applications across different platforms, facilitating easier test development.

Investing in the [WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html) protocol means you
are betting on a single, free, and open protocol for testing that has become a web standard. Don&#039;t
lock yourself into a proprietary stack.

For example, if you use Apple&#039;s XCUITest library without Appium, you can only write tests using
Obj-C/Swift, and you can only run tests through Xcode. Similarly, with Google&#039;s UiAutomator or
Espresso, you can only write tests in Java/Kotlin. Appium opens up the possibility of true

## introduction

htmx allows you to access  [AJAX](https://htmx.org/docs#ajax), [CSS Transitions](https://htmx.org/docs#css_transitions),
[WebSockets](https://htmx.org/extensions/ws/) and [Server Sent Events](https://htmx.org/extensions/sse/)
directly in HTML, using [attributes](https://htmx.org/reference#attributes), so you can build
[modern user interfaces](https://htmx.org/examples) with the [simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) and
[power](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) of hypertext

htmx is small ([~14k min.gz&#039;d](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htmx.org/dist/)),
[dependency-free](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/package.json) &amp;
[extendable](https://htmx.org/extensions)

## motivation

* Why should only `&lt;a&gt;` and `&lt;form&gt;` be able to make HTTP requests?
* Why should only `click` &amp; `submit` events trigger them?
* Why should only GET &amp; POST be available?
* Why should you only be able to replace the *entire* screen?

By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a
[hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)

## quick start

```html
  &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htmx.org@2.0.7/dist/htmx.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX --&gt;
  &lt;button hx-post=&quot;/clicked&quot; hx-swap=&quot;outerHTML&quot;&gt;
    Click Me
  &lt;/button&gt;
```

The [`hx-post`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-post) and [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap) attributes tell htmx:

&gt; &quot;When a user clicks on this button, issue an AJAX request to /clicked, and replace the entire button with the response&quot;

htmx is the successor to [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org)

### installing as a node package

To install using npm:

```
npm install htmx.org --save
```

Note there is an old broken package called `htmx`.  This is `htmx.org`.

### hacking guide

To develop htmx locally, you will need to install the development dependencies.

Run:

```
npm install
```

Then, run a web server in the root.

This is easiest with:

```
npx serve
```

You can then run the test suite by navigating to:

&lt;http://0.0.0.0:3000/test/&gt;

At this point you can modify `/src/htmx.js` to add features, and then add tests in the appropriate area under `/test`.

* `/test/index.html` - the root test page from which all other tests are included
* `/test/attributes` - attribute specific tests
* `/test/core` - core functionality tests
* `/test/core/regressions.js` - regression tests
* `/test/ext` - extension tests
* `/test/manual` - manual tests that cannot be automated

htmx uses the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework, the [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion framework
and [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/releases/v9/fake-xhr-and-server/) to mock out AJAX requests.  They are all OK.

## haiku

*javascript fatigue:&lt;br/&gt;
longing for a hypertext&lt;br/&gt;
already in hand*

### Introduction

Welcome to OpenSign, the premier open source docusign alternative - document e-signing solution designed to provide a secure, reliable and free alternative to commercial esign platforms like DocuSign, PandaDoc, SignNow, Adobe Sign, Smartwaiver, SignRequest, HelloSign &amp; Zoho sign. Our mission is to democratize the document signing process, making it accessible and straightforward for everyone.

---

### Features

- **Secure PDF E-Signing:** With the help of robust encryption algorithms, OpenSign™ ensures maximum security, privacy &amp; compatibility. Now sign unlimited documents even on the [cloud hosted free version of OpenSign](https://www.opensignlabs.com/).
- **Annotate Documents:** OpenSign™ allows you to annotate PDF documents with an advanced signing pad that allows hand drawn signatures, uploaded images, typed signatures &amp; saved signatures for the simplest open source document signing experience ever.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** OpenSign™ was built while keeping Intuitive design in mind for ease of use. Features like &quot;Sign yourself&quot;, &quot;Templates&quot;, &quot;One click signatures&quot; and &quot;OpenSign™ Drive&quot; makes it stand out of the crowd and even makes it better than a lot of so-called industry leaders. OpenSign intends to provide the best document signing experience in the open source ecosystem.
- **Multi-signer Support:** OpenSign&#039;s ability to invite multiple signers for signing along with the ability to invite by sharing signing links &amp; being able to enforce signing in a sequence makes it the only open source solution that is fully loaded and allows it to compete head-to-head with established players in e-signature space.
- **Email Unique Code(OTP) verification support for guest signers:** With OpenSign™, your documents are fully secure even when being signed by guest users. Guest signers can only sign the document after entering a unique code sent to their email address. 
- **&quot;Expiring Docs&quot; &amp; &quot;Rejection&quot;:** You can set documents to expire after certain number of days after which nobody will be able to sign. Not just this, OpenSign™ also allows signers to reject signing a document with a reason that will be promptly shared with the sender.
- **Beautiful email templates:** All document signing invitations, completion notifications &amp; reminders are formatted using great looking email templates. Not just this, you are even allowed to customise the email templates making your free document signing invitations look the way you always wanted them to be.
- **PDF Template Creation:** OpenSign™ allows you to create and store PDF document templates for repeated use thereby saving you a lot of time &amp; collect e-signatures seamlessly.
- **OpenSign™ Drive:** It is a centralised secure vault for your digital documents that makes storing, signing, organizing, sharing &amp; archieving your docs a breeze.
- **Audit Trails &amp; completion certificate:** Being a security focused solution, OpenSign™ makes it a top priority to save detailed logs for tracking document activities along with time-stamps, IP addresses, email IDs &amp; phone numbers. A completion certificate is generated as soon as document is completed which contains all the document related logs for added safety.
- **API Support:** OpenSign™ API allows seamless integration into existing systems and software. You can generate an API key from the app and refer the [official API docs](https://docs.opensignlabs.com/docs/API-docs/opensign-api-v-1) to start integrating it in your existing applications.
- **Integrations:** The open source document signing experience becomes even more seamless because of integrations with various Cloud storage systems, CRMs &amp; enterprise platforms. We also have a Zapier integration that allows you to integrate it with virtually any application.

## Overview

Easy Dataset is an application specifically designed for creating fine-tuning datasets for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides an intuitive interface for uploading domain-specific files, intelligently splitting content, generating questions, and producing high-quality training data for model fine-tuning.

With Easy Dataset, you can transform domain knowledge into structured datasets, compatible with all LLM APIs that follow the OpenAI format, making the fine-tuning process simple and efficient.

   cd easy-dataset
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
   npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
   npm run build

   npm run start
```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:1717`

### Using the Official Docker Image

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset.git
cd easy-dataset
```

2. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
services:
  easy-dataset:
    image: ghcr.io/conardli/easy-dataset
    container_name: easy-dataset
    ports:
      - &#039;1717:1717&#039;
    volumes:
      - ./local-db:/app/local-db
      # - ./prisma:/app/prisma  If mounting is required, please manually initialize the database file first.
    restart: unless-stopped
```

&gt; **Note:** Replace `{YOUR_LOCAL_DB_PATH}` and `{LOCAL_PRISMA_PATH}` with the actual paths where you want to store the local database. It is recommended to use the `local-db` and `prisma` folders in the current code repository directory to maintain consistency with the database paths when starting via NPM.

&gt; **Note:** If you need to mount the database file (PRISMA), you need to run `npm run db:push` in advance to initialize the database file.

3. Start with docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:1717`

### Building with a Local Dockerfile

If you want to build the image yourself, use the Dockerfile in the project root directory:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset.git
cd easy-dataset
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t easy-dataset .
```

3. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 1717:1717 \
  -v {YOUR_LOCAL_DB_PATH}:/app/local-db \
  -v {LOCAL_PRISMA_PATH}:/app/prisma \
  --name easy-dataset \
  easy-dataset
```

&gt; **Note:** Replace `{YOUR_LOCAL_DB_PATH}` and `{LOCAL_PRISMA_PATH}` with the actual paths where you want to store the local database. It is recommended to use the `local-db` and `prisma` folders in the current code repository directory to maintain consistency with the database paths when starting via NPM.

4. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:1717`

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a new way to build web applications. It&#039;s a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.

Learn more at the [Svelte website](https://svelte.dev), or stop by the [Discord chatroom](https://svelte.dev/chat).

## Supporting Svelte

Svelte is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible entirely by fantastic volunteers. If you&#039;d like to support their efforts, please consider:

- [Becoming a backer on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/svelte).

Funds donated via Open Collective will be used for compensating expenses related to Svelte&#039;s development such as hosting costs. If sufficient donations are received, funds may also be used to support Svelte&#039;s development more directly.

## Roadmap

You may view [our roadmap](https://svelte.dev/roadmap) if you&#039;d like to see what we&#039;re currently working on.

## Contributing

Please see the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [`svelte`](packages/svelte) package for information on contributing to Svelte.

&lt;br/&gt;

## Getting Started

### 💻 Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter
cd puter
npm install
npm start
```
**→** This should launch Puter at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;



If this does not work, see [First Run Issues](./doc/self-hosters/first-run-issues.md) for
troubleshooting steps.

&lt;br/&gt;

### 🐳 Docker

```bash
mkdir puter &amp;&amp; cd puter &amp;&amp; mkdir -p puter/config puter/data &amp;&amp; sudo chown -R 1000:1000 puter &amp;&amp; docker run --rm -p 4100:4100 -v `pwd`/puter/config:/etc/puter -v `pwd`/puter/data:/var/puter  ghcr.io/heyputer/puter
```
**→** This should launch Puter at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

### 🐙 Docker Compose

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
mkdir -p puter/config puter/data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 puter
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyPuter/puter/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```
**→** This should be available at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

#### Windows

```powershell
mkdir -p puter
cd puter
New-Item -Path &quot;puter\config&quot; -ItemType Directory -Force
New-Item -Path &quot;puter\data&quot; -ItemType Directory -Force
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyPuter/puter/main/docker-compose.yml&quot; -OutFile &quot;docker-compose.yml&quot;
docker compose up
```
**→** This should launch Puter at 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; http://puter.localhost:4100 (or the next available port). &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.

**TL;DR**

- Bundles [ES Modules](https://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).
- Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
- Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
- Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
- Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

#### Learn about webpack through videos!

- [Understanding Webpack - Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj93pvQIsRo)
- [Understanding Webpack - Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQiJaFzuJ8)

### Get Started

Check out webpack&#039;s quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

### Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
Webpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.

&lt;h2&gt;Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)

Webpack has a [rich plugin
interface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features
within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very
**flexible**.

### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)

Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle
**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own
loaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.

Loaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,
or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.

### Performance

Webpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast
and incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.

### Module Formats

Webpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static
analysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate
simple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.

### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)

Webpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are
loaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.
