### Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?

Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don&#039;t plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.

Documentation is still available but it&#039;s moved to
[https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0) and
[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

## About
**A WhatsApp API client that operates via the WhatsApp Web browser.**

The library launches the WhatsApp Web browser app via Puppeteer, accessing its internal functions and creating a managed instance to reduce the risk of being blocked. This gives the API client nearly all WhatsApp Web features for dynamic use in a Node.js application.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn&#039;t be considered totally safe.**

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

&lt;/div&gt;

[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) is a comprehensive library of React components that features our independent implementation of Google&#039;s [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/design/introduction/) system.
It&#039;s trusted by some of the world&#039;s greatest product teams because it&#039;s been rigorously battle-tested through more than a decade of development by thousands of open-source contributors.

Material UI&#039;s core functionality is extended by [MUI X](https://github.com/mui/mui-x), a suite of complex components for advanced use cases.

## Documentation

Get started in the [Material UI documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Older versions&lt;/summary&gt;

- **[v5.x](https://v5.mui.com/)** ([Upgrading from v5 to v6](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/))
- **[v4.x](https://v4.mui.com/)** ([Upgrading from v4 to v5](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migration-v4/))
- **[v3.x](https://v3.mui.com/)** ([Upgrading from v3 to v4](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migration-v3/))
- **[v0.x](https://v0.mui.com/)** ([Upgrading to v1](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migration-v0x/))

&lt;/details&gt;

**Note:** `@next` points to pre-releases.
Use `@latest` for the latest stable release.

## Joy UI

This repository also contains Joy UI, an experimental component library that implements our own in-house Joy Design.
Joy UI is in beta and _development is currently on hold_.
When starting a new project from scratch, we recommend Material UI over Joy UI because we can guarantee ongoing support.

Keep in mind that the maintainers are primarily focused on other projects and may not be able to respond in a timely manner to issues or pull requests related to Joy UI.

View the [Joy UI documentation](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/).

最全的中华古典文集数据库，包含 5.5 万首唐诗、26 万首宋诗、2.1 万首宋词和其他古典文集。诗人包括唐宋两朝近 1.4 万古诗人，和两宋时期 1.5 千古词人。数据来源于互联网。

**为什么要做这个仓库?** 古诗是中华民族乃至全世界的瑰宝，我们应该传承下去，虽然有古典文集，但大多数人并没有拥有这些书籍。从某种意义上来说，这些庞大的文集离我们是有一定距离的。而电子版方便拷贝，所以此开源数据库诞生了。此数据库通过 JSON 格式分发，可以让你很方便的开始你的项目。

古诗采集没有记录过程，因为古诗数据庞大，目标网站有限制，采集过程经常中断超过了一个星期。2017 年新加入全宋词，[全宋词爬取过程及数据分析](https://jackeygao.github.io/r/words/crawl-ci.html)。

Templates are the core of the [nuclei scanner](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) which powers the actual scanning engine.
This repository stores and houses various templates for the scanner provided by our team, as well as contributed by the community.
We hope that you also contribute by sending templates via **pull requests** or [Github issues](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=submit-template.md&amp;title=%5Bnuclei-template%5D+) to grow the list.


## Nuclei Templates overview


An overview of the nuclei template project, including statistics on unique tags, author, directory, severity, and type of templates. The table below contains the top ten statistics for each matrix; an expanded version of this is [available here](TEMPLATES-STATS.md), and also available in [JSON](TEMPLATES-STATS.json) format for integration.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

### 🚨 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Coverage

Nuclei templates provide coverage for vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild:

| **KEV Source** | **Templates** | **Description** |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 🔴 **CISA KEV** | **454** | [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) |
| 🟠 **VulnCheck KEV** | **1449** | [VulnCheck KEV](https://vulncheck.com/kev) - Enhanced vulnerability intelligence |
| 🟢 **Both Sources** | **407** | Templates covering vulnerabilities in both catalogs |

&gt; 💡 **Total unique KEV templates: 1496** - Use `nuclei -tags kev,vkev` to scan for actively exploited vulnerabilities

Install with yarn:

```bash
yarn add webpack --dev
```

## Introduction

Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.

**TL;DR**

- Bundles [ES Modules](https://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).
- Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
- Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
- Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
- Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

#### Learn about webpack through videos!

- [Understanding Webpack - Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj93pvQIsRo)
- [Understanding Webpack - Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQiJaFzuJ8)

### Get Started

Check out webpack&#039;s quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

### Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
Webpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.

## Concepts

### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)

Webpack has a [rich plugin
interface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features
within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very
**flexible**.

### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)

Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle
**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own
loaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.

Loaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,
or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.
