## Self-hosting Screenity

You can run Screenity locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here&#039;s how:

1. Download the latest Build.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/releases)
2. Load the extension by pasting `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it&#039;s a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the &quot;Load unpacked&quot; button and locate the folder.
4. That&#039;s it, you should now be able to use Screenity locally. [Follow these instructions](#enabling-save-to-google-drive) to set up the Google Drive integration.

## Creating a development version

&gt; ‚ùóÔ∏è Note that the license has changed to [GPLv3](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/blob/master/LICENSE) for the current MV3 version (Screenity version 3.0.0 and higher). Make sure to read the license and the [Terms of Service](https://screenity.io/en/terms/) regarding intellectual property.

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is &gt;= **14**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Load the extension by going to `chrome://extensions/` , and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
6. Click on `Load unpacked extension`.
7. Select the `build` folder.

### Enabling Save to Google Drive

To enable the Google Drive Upload (authorization consent screen) you must change the client_id in the manifest.json file with your linked extension key.

You can create it accessing [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and selecting Create Credential &gt; OAuth Client ID &gt; Chrome App. To create a persistent extension key, you can follow the steps detailed [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/key).

## About
**A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app**

The library works by launching the WhatsApp Web browser application and managing it using Puppeteer to create an instance of WhatsApp Web, thereby mitigating the risk of being blocked. The WhatsApp API client connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app, accessing its internal functions. This grants you access to nearly all the features available on WhatsApp Web, enabling dynamic handling similar to any other Node.js application.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn&#039;t be considered totally safe.**

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

## Introduction
[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) allows anyone ‚Äî be it your development team or your end consumers ‚Äî to visualize and interact with the API‚Äôs resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It‚Äôs automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

## General
**üëâüèº Want to score an easy open-source contribution?** Check out our [Good first issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) label.

**üï∞Ô∏è Looking for the older version of Swagger UI?** Refer to the [*2.x* branch](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x).


This repository publishes three different NPM modules:

* [swagger-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc.).
* [swagger-ui-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that can&#039;t resolve npm module dependencies.
* [swagger-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-react) is Swagger UI packaged as a React component for use in React applications.

We strongly suggest that you use `swagger-ui` instead of `swagger-ui-dist` if you&#039;re building a single-page application, since `swagger-ui-dist` is significantly larger.

If you are looking for plain ol&#039; HTML/JS/CSS, [download the latest release](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest) and copy the contents of the `/dist` folder to your server.


## Compatibility
The OpenAPI Specification has undergone 5 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  Compatibility between Swagger UI and the OpenAPI Specification is as follows:

## Anonymized analytics

SwaggerUI uses [Scarf](https://scarf.sh/) to collect [anonymized installation analytics](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-what-information-does-scarf-js-send-about-me). These analytics help support the maintainers of this library and ONLY run during installation. To [opt out](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-how-can-i-opt-out-of-analytics), you can set the `scarfSettings.enabled` field to `false` in your project&#039;s `package.json`:

```
// package.json
{
  // ...
  &quot;scarfSettings&quot;: {
    &quot;enabled&quot;: false
  }
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `SCARF_ANALYTICS` to `false` as part of the environment that installs your npm packages, e.g., `SCARF_ANALYTICS=false npm install`.

## Try out Label Studio

Install Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. Also you can try [Label Studio Teams](https://app.heartex.com).

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python &gt;=3.7 &lt;=3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you&#039;ve made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you&#039;re using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you&#039;re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‚Äë4.5.0‚Äëcp38‚Äëcp38‚Äëwin_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

#### Run test suite
```bash
pip install -r deploy/requirements-test.txt
cd label_studio

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass)
DJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto
```


## What you get from Label Studio

![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it&#039;s tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/templates-categories.jpg&quot; /&gt;

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).

## How to Install üöÄ

### Installation via Python pip üêç

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker üê≥

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! üòÑ

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

Look at the [Local Development Guide](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/advanced-topics/development) for instructions on setting up a local development environment.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it‚Äôs often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch üåô

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

&gt; üìö Awesome cheatsheets for popular programming languages, frameworks and development tools. They include everything you should know in one single file.

## ü§î Why Awesome-Cheatsheets?

I usually make a cheat sheet when I want to improve my skills in a programming language, a framework or a development tool. [I started doing these kinds of things a long time ago on Gist](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa). To better keep track of the history and to let people contribute, I re-organized all of them into this single repository. Most of the content is coming from official documentation and some books I have read.

Feel free to take a look. You might learn new things. They have been designed to provide a quick way to assess your knowledge and to save you time.

CesiumJS is a JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin. It uses WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, and is cross-platform, cross-browser, and tuned for dynamic-data visualization.

Built on open formats, CesiumJS is designed for robust interoperability and scaling for massive datasets.

## :rocket: Get started

Visit the [Downloads page](https://cesium.com/downloads/) to download a pre-built copy of CesiumJS.

### npm &amp; yarn

If you‚Äôre building your application using a module bundler such as Webpack, Parcel, or Rollup, you can install CesiumJS via the [`cesium` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cesium):

```sh
npm install cesium --save
```

Then, import CesiumJS in your app code. Import individual modules to benefit from tree shaking optimizations through most build tools:

```js
import { Viewer } from &quot;cesium&quot;;
import &quot;cesium/Build/Cesium/Widgets/widgets.css&quot;;

const viewer = new Viewer(&quot;cesiumContainer&quot;);
```

In addition to the `cesium` package, CesiumJS is also [distributed as scoped npm packages for better dependency management](https://cesium.com/blog/2022/12/07/modular-structure-in-cesiumjs/):

- [`@cesium/engine`](./packages/engine/README.md) - CesiumJS&#039;s core, rendering, and data APIs
- [`@cesium/widgets`](./packages/widgets/README.md) - A widgets library for use with CesiumJS

### What next?

See our [Quickstart Guide](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs-learn/cesiumjs-quickstart/) for more information on getting a CesiumJS app up and running.

Instructions for serving local data are in the CesiumJS
[Offline Guide](./Documentation/OfflineGuide/README.md).

## :green_book: License

[Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). CesiumJS is free for both commercial and non-commercial use.

## :earth_americas: Where does the Global 3D Content come from?

The Cesium platform follows an [open-core business model](https://cesium.com/why-cesium/open-ecosystem/cesium-business-model/) with open source runtime engines such as CesiumJS and optional commercial subscription to Cesium ion.

CesiumJS can stream [3D content such as terrain, imagery, and 3D Tiles from the commercial Cesium ion platform](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-ion/content/) alongside open standards from other offline or online services. We provide Cesium ion as the quickest option for all users to get up and running, but you are free to use any combination of content sources with CesiumJS that you please.

Bring your own data for tiling, hosting, and streaming from Cesium ion. [Using Cesium ion](https://cesium.com/ion/signup/) helps support CesiumJS development.

## :white_check_mark: Features

- Stream in 3D Tiles and other standard formats from Cesium ion or another source
- Visualize and analyze on a high-precision WGS84 globe
- Share with users on desktop or mobile

See more in the [CesiumJS Features Checklist](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/wiki/CesiumJS-Features-Checklist).

            <h2>README</h2><pre>About
-----
draw.io, this project, is a configurable diagramming/whiteboarding visualization application. draw.io is jointly owned and developed by JGraph Ltd and draw.io AG.

As well as running this project, we run a production-grade deployment of the diagramming interface at https://app.diagrams.net.

License
-----------------

The minified code authored by us in this repo is licensed under an Apache v2 license, but the sources to build those files are not in this repo. This is not an open source project. We do not accept PRs unless one of the maintainers specifically says it&#039;s OK (basically never).

The JGraph provided icons and diagram templates are licensed under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Additional terms may also apply where the icons are originally defined by a third-party copyright holder. We have checked in all cases that the original license allows use in this project. Also see the terms for using the draw.io logo below.

Additional minified JavaScript files and Java libraries are used in this project. All of the licenses are deemed compatible with the Apache 2.0, nothing is GPL or AGPL, due diligence is performed on all third-party code.

We make no copyright claim on the content you create with this software, regardless of the copyright of individual icons used in such content.

Scope of the Project
--------------------

draw.io is a diagramming or whiteboarding application, depending on which theme is selected. It is not an SVG editing app, the SVG export is designed only for embedding in web pages, not for further editing in other tools.

The application is designed to be entirely as-is. draw.io is not suitable as a framework for building other products from, as source code is not provided. For this try either [Tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) or [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).

Note, in particular, we don&#039;t have support for collaborative editing in this project. If this is important, one of the projects above is likely a better choice.

If you are using a draw.io project/product and have issues or questions about the editor itself, the issue tracker and discussion in this GitHub project are likely a good place to look.

Running
-------

One way to run draw.io is to fork this project, [publish the master branch to GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) and the [pages sites](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) will have the full editor functionality (sans the integrations).

Another way is to use [the recommended Docker project](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio) or to download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net).

The full packaged .war of the client and servlets is built when the project is tagged and available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).

Supported Browsers
------------------

draw.io supports Chrome 123+, Firefox 120+, Safari 17.5+, Opera 109+, WebView Android 137+, Safari iOS 18.5+ and Edge 123+.

Logo and trademark usage
------------------------

draw.io is a registered EU trademark, #018062448

Do not use the draw.io name or any draw.io logo in a way that suggests you are JGraph, your offering or project is by JGraph, or that JGraph is endorsing you or your offering or project.

Do not use any draw.io logo as the icon or logo for your business/organization, offering, project, domain name, social media account, or website.

Do not modify the permitted draw.io logos, including changing the color, dimensions, or combining with other words or design elements.

Do not use JGraph trademarks or logos without JGraph‚Äôs prior written permission.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>About
----- 

**drawio-desktop** is a diagramming desktop app based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that wraps the [core draw.io editor](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).

Download built binaries from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).

**Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don&#039;t change the code and accept it is provided &quot;as-is&quot;, you can use it for any purpose.

Security
--------

draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.

No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. There is a Content Security Policy in place on the web part of the interface to ensure external transmission cannot happen, even by accident.

Security and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no.

Support
-------

Support is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support for non-paying users.

Purchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop.

Developing
----------

**draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.git`

To run this:
1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo)
2. export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode.
3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`.

Note: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also.

To release:
1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin.
2. Wait for the builds to complete (https://travis-ci.org/jgraph/drawio-desktop and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidjgraph/drawio-desktop)
3. Go to https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases, edit the preview release.
4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr http://rfc3161timestamp.globalsign.com/advanced /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe`
5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe`
6. Add release notes
7. Publish release

*Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them.

Local Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io`
- Windows: `C:\Users\&lt;USER-NAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\draw.io\`

Not open-contribution
---------------------

draw.io is closed to contributions (unless a maintainer permits it, which is extremely rare).

The level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes 
can break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required 
is far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we&#039;d have 
to basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented.

We are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, &amp; feature requests. We do
not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we&#039;ve
made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for 
the long term viability of the project.
