            <h2>README</h2><pre># kokoro

An inference library for [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M). You can [`pip install kokoro`](https://pypi.org/project/kokoro/).

&gt; **Kokoro** is an open-weight TTS model with 82 million parameters. Despite its lightweight architecture, it delivers comparable quality to larger models while being significantly faster and more cost-efficient. With Apache-licensed weights, Kokoro can be deployed anywhere from production environments to personal projects.

### Usage
You can run this basic cell on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). [Listen to samples](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/blob/main/SAMPLES.md).
```py
!pip install -q kokoro&gt;=0.9.4 soundfile
!apt-get -qq -y install espeak-ng &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
from kokoro import KPipeline
from IPython.display import display, Audio
import soundfile as sf
import torch
pipeline = KPipeline(lang_code=&#039;a&#039;)
text = &#039;&#039;&#039;

&#039;&#039;&#039;
generator = pipeline(text, voice=&#039;af_heart&#039;)
for i, (gs, ps, audio) in enumerate(generator):
    print(i, gs, ps)
    display(Audio(data=audio, rate=24000, autoplay=i==0))
    sf.write(f&#039;{i}.wav&#039;, audio, 24000)
```
Under the hood, `kokoro` uses [`misaki`](https://pypi.org/project/misaki/), a G2P library at https://github.com/hexgrad/misaki

### Advanced Usage

It was a Sprawl voice and a Sprawl joke. The Chatsubo was a bar for professional expatriates; you could drink there for a week and never hear two words in Japanese.

These were to have an enormous impact, not only because they were associated with Constantine, but also because, as in so many other areas, the decisions taken by Constantine (or in his name) were to have great significance for centuries to come. One of the main issues was the shape that Christian churches were to take, since there was not, apparently, a tradition of monumental church buildings when Constantine decided to help the Christian church build a series of truly spectacular structures. The main form that these churches took was that of the basilica, a multipurpose rectangular structure, based ultimately on the earlier Greek stoa, which could be found in most of the great cities of the empire. Christianity, unlike classical polytheism, needed a large interior space for the celebration of its religious services, and the basilica aptly filled that need. We naturally do not know the degree to which the emperor was involved in the design of new churches, but it is tempting to connect this with the secular basilica that Constantine completed in the Roman forum (the so-called Basilica of Maxentius) and the one he probably built in Trier, in connection with his residence in the city at a time when he was still caesar.

This repository contains both the frontend and the backend of Checkmate, an open-source, self-hosted monitoring tool for tracking server hardware, uptime, response times, and incidents in real-time with beautiful visualizations. Checkmate regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services&#039; availability, downtime, and response time.

Checkmate also has an agent, called [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture), to retrieve data from remote servers. While Capture is not required to run Checkmate, it provides additional insights about your servers&#039; CPU, RAM, disk, and temperature status.

Checkmate has been stress-tested with 1000+ active monitors without any particular issues or performance bottlenecks.

Feel free to stop by our [Matrix room](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#pdfjs:mozilla.org) for questions or guidance.

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the &quot;Modern browsers&quot; version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools &gt; Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.

For an introduction to the PDF.js code, check out the presentation by our
contributor Julian Viereck:

## Community Edition

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. We run a hosted version at [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com), but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.

## Enterprise

If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises). It also includes more features for security (SSO with LDAP or SAML), administration and collaboration (e.g. tracked changes). [Find out more!](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises)

## Keeping up to date

Sign up to the [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/overleaf.com/community-edition-and-server-pro) to get updates on Overleaf releases and development.

## Installation

We have detailed installation instructions in the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/).

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Overleaf, please see the [Release Notes section on the Wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki#release-notes) for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.

## Overleaf Docker Image

This repo contains two dockerfiles, [`Dockerfile-base`](server-ce/Dockerfile-base), which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex-base` image, and [`Dockerfile`](server-ce/Dockerfile) which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex` (or &quot;community&quot;) image.

The Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like `wget`, plus `texlive`.
We split this out because it&#039;s a pretty heavy set of
dependencies, and it&#039;s nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time.

The `sharelatex/sharelatex` image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code
and services.

Use `make build-base` and `make build-community` from `server-ce/` to build these images.

We use the [Phusion base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)
(which is extended by our `base` image) to provide us with a VM-like container
in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the `runit` service
manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the `server-ce/runit`
folder.

Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a security research platform for mobile applications in Android, iOS and Windows Mobile. MobSF can be used for a variety of use cases such as mobile application security, penetration testing, malware analysis, and privacy analysis. The Static Analyzer supports popular mobile app binaries like APK, IPA, APPX and source code. Meanwhile, the Dynamic Analyzer supports both Android and iOS applications and offers a platform for interactive instrumented testing, runtime data and network traffic analysis. MobSF seamlessly integrates with your DevSecOps or CI/CD pipeline, facilitated by REST APIs and CLI tools, enhancing your security workflow with ease.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don&#039;t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

[Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn).

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.
* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you&#039;re looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).

Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
* [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
* [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)
* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)
* [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)
* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Advanced Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)
* [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)
* [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community)
* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from &#039;react-dom/client&#039;;

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(&#039;container&#039;));
root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name=&quot;Taylor&quot; /&gt;);
```

This example will render &quot;Hello Taylor&quot; into a container on the page.

You&#039;ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.

# Introduction

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) designed to teach web
application security lessons.

This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The
exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and
penetration testing techniques.

**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
this program.*  WebGoat&#039;s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
the exposure.

**WARNING 2:** *This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
first thing that all hackers claim.*

# Installation instructions:

For more details check [the Contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 1. Run using Docker

Already have a browser and ZAP and/or Burp installed on your machine in this case you can run the WebGoat image directly using Docker.

Every release is also published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/webgoat/webgoat).

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 webgoat/webgoat
```

For some lessons you need the container run in the same timezone. For this you can set the TZ environment variable.
E.g.

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

If you want to use OWASP ZAP or another proxy, you can no longer use 127.0.0.1 or localhost. but
you can use custom host entries. For example:

```shell
127.0.0.1 www.webgoat.local www.webwolf.local
```

Then you can run the container with:

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e WEBGOAT_HOST=www.webgoat.local -e WEBWOLF_HOST=www.webwolf.local -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

Then visit http://www.webgoat.local:8080/WebGoat/ and http://www.webwolf.local:9090/WebWolf/

## 2. Run using Docker with complete Linux Desktop

Instead of installing tools locally we have a complete Docker image based on running a desktop in your browser. This way you only have to run a Docker image which will give you the best user experience.

```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 webgoat/webgoat-desktop
```

## 3. Standalone

Download the latest WebGoat release from [https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases)

```shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar
```

Click the link in the log to start WebGoat.

### 3.1 Running on a different port

If for some reason you want to run WebGoat on a different port, you can do so by adding the following parameter:

```shell
java -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar --webgoat.port=8001 --webwolf.port=8002
```

For a full overview of all the parameters you can use, please check the [WebGoat properties file](webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application-{webgoat, webwolf}.properties).

## 4. Run from the sources

### Prerequisites:

* Java 23
* Your favorite IDE
* Git, or Git support in your IDE

Open a command shell/window:

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:WebGoat/WebGoat.git
```

Now let&#039;s start by compiling the project.

```Shell
cd WebGoat
git checkout &lt;&lt;branch_name&gt;&gt;
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw clean install

# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd clean install

# Using docker or podman, you can than build the container locally
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t webgoat/webgoat
```

Now we are ready to run the project. WebGoat is using Spring Boot.

```Shell
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

```

... you should be running WebGoat on http://localhost:8080/WebGoat momentarily.

Note: The above link will redirect you to login page if you are not logged in. LogIn/Create account to proceed.

To change the IP address add the following variable to the `WebGoat/webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

```
server.address=x.x.x.x
```

## 4. Run with custom menu

For specialist only. There is a way to set up WebGoat with a personalized menu. You can leave out some menu categories or individual lessons by setting certain environment variables.

For instance running as a jar on a Linux/macOS it will look like this:

```Shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
export EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot;
export EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot;
java -jar target/webgoat-2023.8-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Or in a docker run it would (once this version is pushed into docker hub) look like this:

```Shell
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot; -e EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot; webgoat/webgoat
```

&lt;/table&gt;

### Install with NPM

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset.git
   cd easy-dataset
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
   npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
   npm run build

   npm run start
```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:1717`

### Using the Official Docker Image

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset.git
cd easy-dataset
```

2. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
services:
  easy-dataset:
    image: ghcr.io/conardli/easy-dataset
    container_name: easy-dataset
    ports:
      - &#039;1717:1717&#039;
    volumes:
      - ${LOCAL_DB_PATH}:/app/local-db
      - ${LOCAL_PRISMA_PATH}:/app/prisma
    restart: unless-stopped
```

&gt; **Note:** Replace `{YOUR_LOCAL_DB_PATH}` and `{LOCAL_PRISMA_PATH}` with the actual paths where you want to store the local database. It is recommended to use the `local-db` and `prisma` folders in the current code repository directory to maintain consistency with the database paths when starting via NPM.

3. Start with docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:1717`

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 1717:1717 \
  -v {YOUR_LOCAL_DB_PATH}:/app/local-db \
  -v {LOCAL_PRISMA_PATH}:/app/prisma \
  --name easy-dataset \
  easy-dataset
```

&gt; **Note:** Replace `{YOUR_LOCAL_DB_PATH}` and `{LOCAL_PRISMA_PATH}` with the actual paths where you want to store the local database. It is recommended to use the `local-db` and `prisma` folders in the current code repository directory to maintain consistency with the database paths when starting via NPM.

eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.

  &lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Demo on YouTube&quot; src=&quot;media/youtube-demo-teaser.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

Heavily inspired from the [TRON Legacy movie effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671) (especially the [Board Room sequence](https://gmunk.com/TRON-Board-Room)), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be *&quot;[DEX-UI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui) with less « art » and more « distributable software »&quot;*.

While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.

&lt;br&gt;

It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.

## Q&amp;A
#### How do I get it?
Click on the little badges under the eDEX logo at the top of this page, or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases) tab, or download it through [one of the available repositories](https://repology.org/project/edex-ui/versions) (Homebrew, AUR...).

Public release binaries are unsigned ([why](https://gaby.dev/posts/code-signing)). On Linux, you will need to `chmod +x` the AppImage file in order to run it.
#### I have a problem!
Search through the [Issues](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues) to see if yours has already been reported. If you&#039;re confident it hasn&#039;t been reported yet, feel free to open up a new one. If you see your issue and it&#039;s been closed, it probably means that the fix for it will ship in the next version, and you&#039;ll have to wait a bit.
#### Can you disable the keyboard/the filesystem display?
You can&#039;t disable them (yet) but you can hide them. See the `tron-notype` theme.
#### Why is the file browser saying that &quot;Tracking Failed&quot;? (Windows only)
On Linux and macOS, eDEX tracks where you&#039;re going in your terminal tab to display the content of the current folder on-screen.
Sadly, this is technically impossible to do on Windows right now, so the file browser reverts back to a &quot;detached&quot; mode. You can still use it to browse files &amp; directories and click on files to input their path in the terminal.
#### Can this run on a Raspberry Pi / ARM device?
We provide prebuilt arm64 builds. For other platforms, see [this issue comment](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/313#issuecomment-443465345), and the thread on issue [#818](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/818).
#### Is this repo actively maintained?
No, after a 3 years run, this project has been archived. See the [announcement](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases/tag/v2.2.8).
#### How did you make this?
Glad you&#039;re interested! See [#272](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/272).
#### This is so cool.
Thanks! If you feel like it, you can [follow me on Twitter](https://gaby.dev/twitter) to hear about new stuff I&#039;m making.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the following instructions are meant for running eDEX from the latest unoptimized, unreleased, development version. If you&#039;d like to get stable software instead, refer to [these](#how-do-i-get-it) instructions.

#### Starting from source:
on *nix systems (You&#039;ll need the Xcode command line tools on macOS):
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-linux`
- `npm run start`

on Windows:
- start cmd or powershell **as administrator**
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-windows`
- `npm run start`

#### Building
Note: Due to native modules, you can only build targets for the host OS you are using.

- `npm install` (NOT `install-linux` or `install-windows`)
- `npm run build-linux` or `build-windows` or `build-darwin`

The script will minify the source code, recompile native dependencies and create distributable assets in the `dist` folder.

#### Getting the bleeding edge
If you&#039;re interested in running the latest in-development version but don&#039;t want to compile source code yourself, you can can get pre-built nightly binaries on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/actions): click the latest commits, and download the artifacts bundle for your OS.

## Credits
eDEX-UI&#039;s source code was primarily written by me, [Squared](https://github.com/GitSquared). If you want to get in touch with me or find other projects I&#039;m involved in, check out [my website](https://gaby.dev).

[PixelyIon](https://github.com/PixelyIon) helped me get started with Windows compatibility and offered some precious advice when I started to work on this project seriously.

[IceWolf](https://soundcloud.com/iamicewolf) composed the sound effects on v2.1.x and above. He makes really cool stuff, check out his music!

## Thanks
Of course, eDEX would never have existed if I hadn&#039;t stumbled upon the amazing work of [Seena](https://github.com/seenaburns) on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

This project uses a bunch of open-source libraries, frameworks and tools, see [the full dependency graph](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/network/dependencies).

I want to namely thank the developers behind [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) and [SmoothieCharts](https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie).

Huge thanks to [Rob &quot;Arscan&quot; Scanlon](https://github.com/arscan) for making the fantastic [ENCOM Globe](https://github.com/arscan/encom-globe), also inspired by the TRON: Legacy movie, and distributing it freely. His work really puts the icing on the cake.

***

Appium is an open-source automation framework that provides
[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)-based automation possibilities for a wide range of
different mobile, desktop and IoT platforms. Appium is modular and extensible, and supports multiple
programming languages, which means there is an entire ecosystem of related software:
* [__Drivers__](#drivers) add support for automating specific platforms
* [__Clients__](#clients) allow writing Appium tests in your programming language of choice
* [__Plugins__](#plugins) allow to further extend Appium functionality

## Migrating From Appium 1 to Appium 2

As of January 1st, 2022, the Appium team no longer maintains or supports Appium 1. All officially
supported platform drivers are only compatible with Appium 2.

__[Please read the Migration Guide](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/guides/migrating-1-to-2/) if you
are still using Appium 1.__

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; If you use Appium Desktop or Appium Server GUI, you will not be able to upgrade to Appium 2, as
both of these tools have been deprecated. Please use [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector)
in combination with a standalone Appium 2 server.

## Installation

Appium can be installed using `npm` (other package managers are not currently supported). Please
check the [installation docs](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/quickstart/install/) for the
system requirements and further information.

If upgrading from Appium 1, make sure Appium 1 is fully uninstalled (`npm uninstall -g appium`).
Unexpected errors might appear if this has not been done.

```bash
npm i -g appium
```

Note that this will only install the core Appium server, which cannot automate anything on its own.
Please install [drivers](#drivers) for your target platforms in order to automate them.

## Drivers

Appium supports app automation across a variety of platforms, like iOS, Android, macOS, Windows,
and more. Each platform is supported by one or more &quot;drivers&quot;, which know how to automate that
particular platform. You can find a full list of officially-supported and third-party drivers in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Drivers page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/drivers/).

Driver management is done using [Appium&#039;s Extension command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/extensions/):

```bash
# Install an official driver from npm (see documentation for a list of such drivers)
appium driver install &lt;driver-name&gt;
# Install any driver from npm
appium driver install --source=npm &lt;driver-name&gt;
# See documentation for installation from other sources

# List already installed drivers
appium driver list --installed
# Update a driver (it must be already installed)
# This will NOT update the major version, in order to prevent breaking changes
appium driver update &lt;driver-name&gt;
# Update a driver to the most recent version (may include breaking changes)
appium driver update &lt;driver-name&gt; --unsafe
# Uninstall a driver (it won&#039;t last forever, will it?)
appium driver uninstall &lt;driver-name&gt;
```

## Clients

Client libraries enable writing Appium tests in different programming languages. There are
officially-supported clients for Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET C#, as well as third-party clients
for other languages. You can find a full list of clients in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Clients page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/clients/).

## Plugins

Plugins allow you to extend server functionality without changing the server code. The main
difference between drivers and plugins is that the latter must be explicitly enabled on
Appium server startup (all installed drivers are enabled by default):

```bash
appium --use-plugins=&lt;plugin-name&gt;
```

You can find a full list of officially-supported and third-party plugins in
[Appium Ecosystem&#039;s Plugins page](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/plugins/).

Similarly to drivers, plugin management is also done using
[Appium&#039;s Extension command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/extensions/):

```bash
# Install an official plugin from npm (see documentation for a list of such plugins)
appium plugin install &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# Install any plugin from npm
appium plugin install --source=npm &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# See documentation for installation from other sources

# List already installed plugins
appium plugin list --installed
# Update a plugin (it must be already installed)
# This will NOT update the major version, in order to prevent breaking changes
appium plugin update &lt;plugin-name&gt;
# Update a plugin to the most recent version (may include breaking changes)
appium plugin update &lt;plugin-name&gt; --unsafe
# Uninstall a plugin
appium plugin uninstall &lt;plugin-name&gt;
```

## Server Command Line Interface

In order to start sending commands to the Appium server, it must be running on the URL and port
where your client library expects it to listen. [Appium&#039;s command-line interface](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/cli/args/)
is used to launch and configure the server:

```bash
# Start the server on the default host (0.0.0.0) and port (4723)
appium server
# You can also omit the &#039;server&#039; subcommand
appium
# Start the server on the given host, port and use a custom base path prefix (the default prefix is &#039;/&#039;)
appium --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9000 --base-path /wd/hub
```

Appium supports execution of parallel server processes, as well as parallel driver sessions within a
single server process. Refer the corresponding driver documentations regarding which mode is optimal
for the particular driver or whether it supports parallel sessions.

## Why Appium?

1. You usually don&#039;t have to recompile your app or modify it in any way, due to the use of standard
   automation APIs on all platforms.
2. You can write tests with your favorite dev tools using any WebDriver-compatible language such as
   Java, Python, Ruby and C#. There are also third party client implementations for other languages.
3. You can use any testing framework.
4. Some drivers like `xcuitest` and `uiautomator2` have built-in mobile web and hybrid app support.
   Within the same script, you can switch seamlessly between native app automation and webview
   automation, all using the WebDriver model that&#039;s already the standard for web automation.
5. You can run your automated tests locally and in a cloud. There are multiple cloud providers that
   support various Appium drivers (mostly targeting iOS and Android mobile automation).
6. [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector) can be used to visually inspect
   the page source of applications across different platforms, facilitating easier test development.

Investing in the [WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html) protocol means you
are betting on a single, free, and open protocol for testing that has become a web standard. Don&#039;t
lock yourself into a proprietary stack.

For example, if you use Apple&#039;s XCUITest library without Appium, you can only write tests using
Obj-C/Swift, and you can only run tests through Xcode. Similarly, with Google&#039;s UiAutomator or
Espresso, you can only write tests in Java/Kotlin. Appium opens up the possibility of true
cross-platform native app automation, for mobile and beyond!

If you are looking for a more comprehensive description of what this is all about, please read our
documentation on [How Does Appium Work?](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/intro/appium/).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># React - The Complete Guide Course Resources

This repository provides access to code files, code snapshots, slides &amp; other resources that are used or provided by the [React - The Complete Guide](https://acad.link/reactjs) course.

If you&#039;re facing any issues with the code, please post in the course Q&amp;A section.

# Repository Content

- **Code Snapshots:** All code snapshots (starting snapshots, intermediate snapshots, finished snapshots) for the various course sections can be found in the [/code](/code/) folder.
- **Lecture Attachments:** Any standalone code files or other attachments that are mentioned in course lectures (and attached to those lectures) are stored in the [/attachments](/attachments/) folder.
- **Other Resources:** Other resources (like the course slides) can be found in the [/other](/other/) folder.

The **Code Snapshots** and **Lecture Attachments** folders contain one subfolder per course section - this allows you to easily access the resources for a specific course section.

# How To Use Code Snapshots

Code snapshots are primarily provided to allow you to compare your code to mine. The snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and therefore reflect my code you see in the videos.

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine. You&#039;ll need to run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server - just as shown in the course.

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.

**TL;DR**

- Bundles [ES Modules](https://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).
- Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
- Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
- Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
- Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

#### Learn about webpack through videos!

- [Understanding Webpack - Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj93pvQIsRo)
- [Understanding Webpack - Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQiJaFzuJ8)

### Get Started

Check out webpack&#039;s quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

### Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
Webpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.

&lt;h2&gt;Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)

Webpack has a [rich plugin
interface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features
within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very
**flexible**.

### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)

Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle
**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own
loaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.

Loaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,
or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.

Webpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast
and incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.

Templates are the core of the [nuclei scanner](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) which powers the actual scanning engine.
This repository stores and houses various templates for the scanner provided by our team, as well as contributed by the community.
We hope that you also contribute by sending templates via **pull requests** or [Github issues](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=submit-template.md&amp;title=%5Bnuclei-template%5D+) to grow the list.
