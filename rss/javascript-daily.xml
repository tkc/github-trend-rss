[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! While this collection was originally created for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), these prompts work great with other AI models like [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Hugging Face Chat](https://hf.co/chat), [Llama](https://meta.ai), [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai), and more.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a web interface created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use AI to help generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for your preferred AI chat model. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun exploring AI chat models!

&gt; or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out
&gt; and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the
&gt; prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

最全的中华古典文集数据库，包含 5.5 万首唐诗、26 万首宋诗、2.1 万首宋词和其他古典文集。诗人包括唐宋两朝近 1.4 万古诗人，和两宋时期 1.5 千古词人。数据来源于互联网。

**为什么要做这个仓库?** 古诗是中华民族乃至全世界的瑰宝，我们应该传承下去，虽然有古典文集，但大多数人并没有拥有这些书籍。从某种意义上来说，这些庞大的文集离我们是有一定距离的。而电子版方便拷贝，所以此开源数据库诞生了。此数据库通过 JSON 格式分发，可以让你很方便的开始你的项目。

古诗采集没有记录过程，因为古诗数据庞大，目标网站有限制，采集过程经常中断超过了一个星期。2017 年新加入全宋词，[全宋词爬取过程及数据分析](https://jackeygao.github.io/r/words/crawl-ci.html)。

## Usage

Here&#039;s a super-simple Hello World example - a spinning cube!

```js
import * as pc from &#039;playcanvas&#039;;

const canvas = document.createElement(&#039;canvas&#039;);
document.body.appendChild(canvas);

const app = new pc.Application(canvas);

// fill the available space at full resolution
app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW);
app.setCanvasResolution(pc.RESOLUTION_AUTO);

// ensure canvas is resized when window changes size
window.addEventListener(&#039;resize&#039;, () =&gt; app.resizeCanvas());

// create box entity
const box = new pc.Entity(&#039;cube&#039;);
box.addComponent(&#039;model&#039;, {
  type: &#039;box&#039;
});
app.root.addChild(box);

// create camera entity
const camera = new pc.Entity(&#039;camera&#039;);
camera.addComponent(&#039;camera&#039;, {
  clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
});
app.root.addChild(camera);
camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);

// create directional light entity
const light = new pc.Entity(&#039;light&#039;);
light.addComponent(&#039;light&#039;);
app.root.addChild(light);
light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

// rotate the box according to the delta time since the last frame
app.on(&#039;update&#039;, dt =&gt; box.rotate(10 * dt, 20 * dt, 30 * dt));

app.start();
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Viewing beta v1 documentation – usable but expect breaking changes. For stable version, see [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/tree/v0)

👋 _Hey! Using React, Vue or Astro? Check my new project [MistCSS](https://github.com/typicode/mistcss) to write 50% less code._

## Install

```shell
npm install json-server
```

## Usage

Create a `db.json` or `db.json5` file

```json
{
  &quot;posts&quot;: [
    { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;a title&quot;, &quot;views&quot;: 100 },
    { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;another title&quot;, &quot;views&quot;: 200 }
  ],
  &quot;comments&quot;: [
    { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;a comment about post 1&quot;, &quot;postId&quot;: &quot;1&quot; },
    { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;another comment about post 1&quot;, &quot;postId&quot;: &quot;1&quot; }
  ],
  &quot;profile&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;typicode&quot;
  }
}
```

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;View db.json5 example&lt;/summary&gt;

```json5
{
  posts: [
    { id: &#039;1&#039;, title: &#039;a title&#039;, views: 100 },
    { id: &#039;2&#039;, title: &#039;another title&#039;, views: 200 },
  ],
  comments: [
    { id: &#039;1&#039;, text: &#039;a comment about post 1&#039;, postId: &#039;1&#039; },
    { id: &#039;2&#039;, text: &#039;another comment about post 1&#039;, postId: &#039;1&#039; },
  ],
  profile: {
    name: &#039;typicode&#039;,
  },
}
```

You can read more about JSON5 format [here](https://github.com/json5/json5).

&lt;/details&gt;

Pass it to JSON Server CLI

```shell
$ npx json-server db.json
```

Get a REST API

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:3000/posts/1
{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;a title&quot;,
  &quot;views&quot;: 100
}
```

Run `json-server --help` for a list of options

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This project uses the [Fair Source License](https://fair.io/). Only organizations with 3+ users are kindly asked to contribute a small amount through sponsorship [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/typicode) for usage. __This license helps keep the project sustainable and healthy, benefiting everyone.__
&gt;
&gt; For more information, FAQs, and the rationale behind this, visit [https://fair.io/](https://fair.io/).

## Routes

Based on the example `db.json`, you&#039;ll get the following routes:

```
GET    /posts
GET    /posts/:id
POST   /posts
PUT    /posts/:id
PATCH  /posts/:id
DELETE /posts/:id

# Same for comments
```

```
GET   /profile
PUT   /profile
PATCH /profile
```

## Params

### Conditions

- ` ` → `==`
- `lt` → `&lt;`
- `lte` → `&lt;=`
- `gt` → `&gt;`
- `gte` → `&gt;=`
- `ne` → `!=`

```
GET /posts?views_gt=9000
```

### Range

- `start`
- `end`
- `limit`

```
GET /posts?_start=10&amp;_end=20
GET /posts?_start=10&amp;_limit=10
```

### Paginate

- `page`
- `per_page` (default = 10)

```
GET /posts?_page=1&amp;_per_page=25
```

### Sort

- `_sort=f1,f2`

```
GET /posts?_sort=id,-views
```

### Nested and array fields

- `x.y.z...`
- `x.y.z[i]...`

```
GET /foo?a.b=bar
GET /foo?x.y_lt=100
GET /foo?arr[0]=bar
```

### Embed

```
GET /posts?_embed=comments
GET /comments?_embed=post
```

## Delete

```
DELETE /posts/1
DELETE /posts/1?_dependent=comments
```

## Serving static files

If you create a `./public` directory, JSON Server will serve its content in addition to the REST API.

You can also add custom directories using `-s/--static` option.

```sh
json-server -s ./static
json-server -s ./static -s ./node_modules
```

## Notable differences with v0.17

- `id` is always a string and will be generated for you if missing
- use `_per_page` with `_page` instead of `_limit`for pagination
- use Chrome&#039;s `Network tab &gt; throtling` to delay requests instead of `--delay` CLI option

## Client did not pay?

Add opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the website is fully vanished. 


```javascript
/* change these variables as you wish */
var due_date = new Date(&#039;2017-02-27&#039;);
var days_deadline = 60;
/* stop changing here */
```

# Video.js - Web Video Player &amp; Framework

[![NPM][npm-icon]][npm-link]

**Update:** Big changes coming in Video.js 10, early 2026! [Read the discussion.](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/discussions/9035)

Video.js is a full featured, open source video player for all web-based platforms.

Right out of the box, Video.js supports all common media formats used on the web including streaming formats like HLS and DASH. It works on desktops, mobile devices, tablets, and web-based Smart TVs. It can be further extended and customized by a robust ecosystem of [plugins][plugins].

Video.js was started in May 2010 and since then:
* Millions of websites have used VideoJS over time (source [Builtwith][builtwith])
* Billions of end-users every month of just the CDN-hosted copy (source Fastly stats)
* 900+ amazing contributors to the video.js core
* Hundreds of [plugins](https://videojs.com/plugins/)

## Table of Contents

* [Quick Start](#quick-start)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)
* [License](#license)

## [Quick Start][getting-started]

Thanks to the awesome folks over at [Fastly][fastly], there&#039;s a free, CDN hosted version of Video.js that anyone can use. Add these tags to your document&#039;s `&lt;head&gt;`:

```html
&lt;link href=&quot;//vjs.zencdn.net/8.23.3/video-js.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//vjs.zencdn.net/8.23.3/video.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Alternatively, you can include Video.js by getting it from [npm](https://videojs.com/getting-started/#install-via-npm), downloading it from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/releases) or by including it via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) or another JavaScript CDN, like CDNjs.

```html
&lt;!-- unpkg : use the latest version of Video.js --&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video-js.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- unpkg : use a specific version of Video.js (change the version numbers as necessary) --&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;https://unpkg.com/video.js@8.23.3/dist/video-js.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/video.js@8.23.3/dist/video.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- cdnjs : use a specific version of Video.js (change the version numbers as necessary) --&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/video.js/8.23.3/video-js.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/video.js/8.23.3/video.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Next, using Video.js is as simple as creating a `&lt;video&gt;` element, but with an additional `data-setup` attribute. At a minimum, this attribute must have a value of `&#039;{}&#039;`, but it can include any Video.js [options][options] - just make sure it contains valid JSON!

```html
&lt;video
    id=&quot;my-player&quot;
    class=&quot;video-js&quot;
    controls
    preload=&quot;auto&quot;
    poster=&quot;//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.png&quot;
    data-setup=&#039;{}&#039;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;vjs-no-js&quot;&gt;
    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a
    web browser that
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
      supports HTML5 video
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
```

When the page loads, Video.js will find this element and automatically setup a player in its place.

If you don&#039;t want to use automatic setup, you can leave off the `data-setup` attribute and initialize a `&lt;video&gt;` element manually using the `videojs` function:

```js
var player = videojs(&#039;my-player&#039;);
```

The `videojs` function also accepts an `options` object and a callback to be invoked when the player is ready:

```js
var options = {};

var player = videojs(&#039;my-player&#039;, options, function onPlayerReady() {
  videojs.log(&#039;Your player is ready!&#039;);

  // In this context, `this` is the player that was created by Video.js.
  this.play();

  // How about an event listener?
  this.on(&#039;ended&#039;, function() {
    videojs.log(&#039;Awww...over so soon?!&#039;);
  });
});
```

If you&#039;re ready to dive in, the [Getting Started][getting-started] page and [documentation][docs] are the best places to go for more information. If you get stuck, head over to our [Slack][slack-link]!

`uni-app` 是一个使用 `Vue.js` 开发小程序、H5、App的统一前端框架。官网地址：[https://uniapp.dcloud.io](https://uniapp.dcloud.io)

开发者使用 `Vue` 语法编写代码，`uni-app` 框架将其编译到 小程序（微信/支付宝/百度/字节跳动/QQ/快手/钉钉/小红书）、App（iOS/Android）、H5等多个平台，保证其正确运行并达到优秀体验。


# uni-app的特点

- 开发者和案例更多：HBuilder装机量800万台，开发者社区月活百万，70多个QQ微信群承载10万人。案例众多，uni统计月活超10亿（[详见](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/case)）
- 性能更高（见[评测](https://juejin.im/post/5ca1736af265da30ae314248)）
- 更丰富的周边生态，[插件市场](https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/)数千款插件
- 提供比小程序原生开发更好的开发体验、更高的工程化效率
- 跨端抹平度更完善，且各端特色发挥更灵活，可真正实现一套代码多端覆盖，无需各端多头维护升级
- 权威认可：阿里小程序官方工具内置uni-app（[详见](https://docs.alipay.com/mini/ide/0.70-stable)）、腾讯课堂官方自制uni-app培训视频（[详见](https://ask.dcloud.net.cn/article/35640)）

## 扫码体验

开发一次，编译到14个平台。依次扫描14个二维码，亲自体验最全面的跨平台效果！

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://web-ext-storage.dcloud.net.cn/doc/uni-support-platform-qrcode.jpg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

*注： 某些平台不能提交简单demo，补充了一些其他功能。*

## 快速开始

`uni-app`支持通过`vue-cli`命令行、`HBuilderX`可视化界面两种方式快速创建项目：

- [vue-cli命令行方式](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/quickstart?id=_2-通过vue-cli命令行)：不限IDE，适合对node熟悉的开发者，扩展阅读：[在vscode中开发uni-app](https://ask.dcloud.net.cn/article/36286)、[在 WebStorm 中开发 uni-app](https://ask.dcloud.net.cn/article/36307)
- [HBuilderX可视化界面](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/quickstart?id=_1-通过-hbuilderx-可视化界面)：专用IDE，内置相关环境，开箱即用，开发效率更高。

## 需求墙

`uni-app`计划支持的功能点，会在需求墙上进行展示，征集开发者的投票意见，[前往投票](https://dev.dcloud.net.cn/wish/)。

## 更新日志

`uni-app`一直保持高频的更新迭代，详见[正式版更新日志](https://uniapp.dcloud.net.cn/release)、[Alpha版更新日志](https://uniapp.dcloud.net.cn/release-note-alpha)。

## 论坛

由于`DCloud`有70多个QQ、微信群，官方已无法维护更多交流群。请开发者到官方论坛交流：[https://ask.dcloud.net.cn/explore/](https://ask.dcloud.net.cn/explore/) 。论坛提供了比issues更专业的工具服务。

## 插件市场

`uni-app`有丰富的插件生态，众多开发者提交了数千款组件、sdk、项目模板，详见：[https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/](https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/)

除了众多三方ui库，官方还提供了uni-ui，在性能和跨端兼容方面有更强的优势。详见：[https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/plugin?id=55](https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/plugin?id=55)

## 常见疑问

- 问：不同端有不同的需求、不同的特色，登录支付也不一样，如何统一？
- 答：差异部分使用条件编译。uni-app提供了灵活强大的[条件编译](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/platform)。可以完美处理复用部分和差异部分。真正一套工程源码。当业务升级时，不再需要多端维护。如果多端维护，经常会因为某些端的流量不大，就一直拖延无法让那些用户享受到最新服务。另外登录支付在客户端部分，已经被uni-app统一成一样的api了。


- 问：多端是不是一种妥协，是否会造成性能下降？
- 答：good question。多端且不影响性能，确实很难，但uni-app做到了。在h5端，它的性能、包体积与直接使用vue.js开发一致； 在小程序端，它的性能比大多数开发框架更好，uni-app底层自动处理的setdata差量同步机制，比开发者手动写setdata更好，就像使用vue.js更新界面比手动写js修改dom更高效一样； 在App，uni-app支持webview渲染和原生渲染双引擎，启用原生渲染时，css写法受限，但性能是很接近原生开发的效果的，在当前的手机环境下，千万日活以下的应用在App使用uni-app也不会遇到任何压力。当然也可以在已经做好的原生App中将部分页面改为uni-app实现; 此外，我们会把很多跨端处理放在编译期完成的，这样会减少对运行期的效率影响。


- 问：不做多端，是不是不需要uni-app？
- 答：不是。大量开发者用uni-app只做一个端，详见[案例](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/case)。对于开发者而言，一个优秀工具在手，做什么都不愁。

- 问：uni-app以后会不会变更开源协议，转向收费？
- 答：官方承诺永远不会变更开源协议。无论HBuilderX、uni-app、App，面向中国人永久免费。

## Community Edition

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. We run a hosted version at [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com), but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.

## Enterprise

If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises). It also includes more features for security (SSO with LDAP or SAML), administration and collaboration (e.g. tracked changes). [Find out more!](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises)

## Keeping up to date

Sign up to the [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/overleaf.com/community-edition-and-server-pro) to get updates on Overleaf releases and development.

## Installation

We have detailed installation instructions in the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/).

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Overleaf, please see the [Release Notes section on the Wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki#release-notes) for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.

## Overleaf Docker Image

This repo contains two dockerfiles, [`Dockerfile-base`](server-ce/Dockerfile-base), which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex-base` image, and [`Dockerfile`](server-ce/Dockerfile) which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex` (or &quot;community&quot;) image.

The Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like `wget`, plus `texlive`.
We split this out because it&#039;s a pretty heavy set of
dependencies, and it&#039;s nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time.

The `sharelatex/sharelatex` image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code
and services.

Use `make build-base` and `make build-community` from `server-ce/` to build these images.

We use the [Phusion base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)
(which is extended by our `base` image) to provide us with a VM-like container
in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the `runit` service
manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the `server-ce/runit`
folder.

## Install &amp; Upgrade

```
bash &lt;(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui/refs/tags/v2.6.0/install.sh)
```

## Install legacy Version (we don&#039;t recommend)

To install your desired version, use following installation command. e.g., ver `v1.7.9`:

```
VERSION=v1.7.9 &amp;&amp; bash &lt;(curl -Ls &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhsanaei/3x-ui/$VERSION/install.sh&quot;) $VERSION
```

## SSL Certificate

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Click for SSL Certificate details&lt;/summary&gt;

### ACME

To manage SSL certificates using ACME:

1. Ensure your domain is correctly resolved to the server.
2. Run the `x-ui` command in the terminal, then choose `SSL Certificate Management`.
3. You will be presented with the following options:

   - **Get SSL:** Obtain SSL certificates.
   - **Revoke:** Revoke existing SSL certificates.
   - **Force Renew:** Force renewal of SSL certificates.
   - **Show Existing Domains:** Display all domain certificates available on the server.  
   - **Set Certificate Paths for the Panel:** Specify the certificate for your domain to be used by the panel. 

### Certbot

To install and use Certbot:

```sh
apt-get install certbot -y
certbot certonly --standalone --agree-tos --register-unsafely-without-email -d yourdomain.com
certbot renew --dry-run
```

### Cloudflare

The management script includes a built-in SSL certificate application for Cloudflare. To use this script to apply for a certificate, you need the following:

- Cloudflare registered email
- Cloudflare Global API Key
- The domain name must be resolved to the current server through Cloudflare

**How to get the Cloudflare Global API Key:**

1. Run the `x-ui` command in the terminal, then choose `Cloudflare SSL Certificate`.
2. Visit the link: [Cloudflare API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
3. Click on &quot;View Global API Key&quot; (see the screenshot below):
   ![](media/APIKey1.PNG)
4. You may need to re-authenticate your account. After that, the API Key will be shown (see the screenshot below):
   ![](media/APIKey2.png)

When using, just enter your `domain name`, `email`, and `API KEY`. The diagram is as follows:

**For versions `v2.1.0` and later:**

WARP is built-in, and no additional installation is required. Simply turn on the necessary configuration in the panel.

&lt;/details&gt;

## IP Limit

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Click for IP limit details&lt;/summary&gt;

#### Usage

**Note:** IP Limit won&#039;t work correctly when using IP Tunnel.

- **For versions up to `v1.6.1`:**
  - The IP limit is built-in to the panel

**For versions `v1.7.0` and newer:**

To enable the IP Limit functionality, you need to install `fail2ban` and its required files by following these steps:

1. Run the `x-ui` command in the terminal, then choose `IP Limit Management`.
2. You will see the following options:

   - **Change Ban Duration:** Adjust the duration of bans.
   - **Unban Everyone:** Lift all current bans.
   - **Check Logs:** Review the logs.
   - **Fail2ban Status:** Check the status of `fail2ban`.
   - **Restart Fail2ban:** Restart the `fail2ban` service.
   - **Uninstall Fail2ban:** Uninstall Fail2ban with configuration.

3. Add a path for the access log on the panel by setting `Xray Configs/log/Access log` to `./access.log` then save and restart xray.

- **For versions before `v2.1.3`:**
  - You need to set the access log path manually in your Xray configuration:

    ```sh
    &quot;log&quot;: {
      &quot;access&quot;: &quot;./access.log&quot;,
      &quot;dnsLog&quot;: false,
      &quot;loglevel&quot;: &quot;warning&quot;
    },
    ```

- **For versions `v2.1.3` and newer:**
  - There is an option for configuring `access.log` directly from the panel.

&lt;/details&gt;

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Model Context Protocol servers

This repository is a collection of *reference implementations* for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references
to community built servers and additional resources.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.
Each MCP server is implemented with either the [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

&gt; Note: Lists in this README are maintained in alphabetical order to minimize merge conflicts when adding new items.

  # _Send it_, with [PairDrop](https://pairdrop.net)

  &lt;p&gt;
    Local file sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pairdrop.net&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in your web browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
    &lt;br&gt;
    Inspired by Apple&#039;s AirDrop.
    &lt;br&gt; 
    Fork of Snapdrop.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop/issues&quot;&gt;Report a bug&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop/issues&quot;&gt;Request feature&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

## Features

## Differences to the [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop) it is based on
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;View all differences&lt;/summary&gt;

### Paired Devices and Public Rooms — Internet Transfer
* Transfer files over the Internet between paired devices or by entering temporary public rooms.
* Connect to devices in complex network environments (public Wi-Fi, company network, iCloud Private Relay, VPN, etc.).
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* Devices outside of your local network that are behind a NAT are auto-connected via the PairDrop TURN server.
* Devices from the local network, in the same public room, or previously paired are shown.

#### Persistent Device Pairing

Always connect to known devices

* Pair devices via a 6-digit code or a QR-Code.
* Paired devices always find each other via shared secrets independently of their local network. 
* Pairing is persistent. You find your devices even after reopening PairDrop.
* You can edit and unpair devices easily.

#### Temporary Public Rooms

Connect to others in complex network situations, or over the Internet.

* Enter a public room via a 5-letter code or a QR-code.
* Enter a public room to temporarily connect to devices outside your local network.
* All devices in the same public room see each other.
* Public rooms are temporary. Closing PairDrop  leaves all rooms.

### [Improved UI for Sending/Receiving Files](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/issues/560)
* Files are transferred after a request is accepted. Files are auto-downloaded upon completing a transfer, if possible.
* Multiple files are downloaded as a ZIP file
* Download, share or save to gallery via the &quot;Share&quot; menu on Android and iOS.
* Multiple files are transferred at once with an overall progress indicator.

### Send Files or Text Directly From Share Menu, Context Menu or CLI
* [Send files directly from context menu on Ubuntu (using Nautilus)](docs/how-to.md#send-multiple-files-and-directories-directly-from-context-menu-on-ubuntu-using-nautilus)
* [Send files directly from the context menu on Windows](docs/how-to.md#send-files-directly-from-context-menu-on-windows)
* [Send directly from the &quot;Share&quot; menu on iOS](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-ios)
* [Send directly from the &quot;Share&quot; menu on Android](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-android)
* [Send directly via the command-line interface](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-via-command-line-interface)

### Other Changes
* Change your display name to easily differentiate your devices.
* [Paste files/text and choose the recipient afterwards ](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/534)
* [Prevent devices from sleeping on file transfer](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/413)
* Warn user before PairDrop is closed on file transfer
* Open PairDrop on multiple tabs simultaneously (Thanks [@willstott101](https://github.com/willstott101))
* [Video and audio preview](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/455) (Thanks [@victorwads](https://github.com/victorwads))
* Switch theme back to auto/system after dark or light mode is on
* Node-only implementation (Thanks [@Bellisario](https://github.com/Bellisario))
* Auto-restart on error (Thanks [@KaKi87](https://github.com/KaKi87))
* Lots of stability fixes (Thanks [@MWY001](https://github.com/MWY001) [@skiby7](https://github.com/skiby7) and [@willstott101](https://github.com/willstott101))
* To host PairDrop on your local network (e.g. on Raspberry Pi): [All peers connected with private IPs are discoverable by each other](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/558)
* When hosting PairDrop yourself, you can [set your own STUN/TURN servers](docs/host-your-own.md#specify-stunturn-servers)
* Translations.

&lt;/details&gt;
