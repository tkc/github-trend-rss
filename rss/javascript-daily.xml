## Mission

**The world is rushing to build AI systems. It is not engineering them.**

That gap is what we mean by AI engineering.

**AI engineering is the discipline of building efficient, reliable, safe, and robust intelligent systems that operate in the real world, not just models in isolation.**

**Our mission:** Establish AI engineering as a foundational discipline, alongside software engineering and computer engineering, by teaching how to design, build, and evaluate end to end intelligent systems. The long term impact of AI will be shaped by engineers who can turn ideas into working, dependable systems.

---

## What’s in this repo

This repository is the open learning stack for AI systems engineering.

It includes the textbook source, TinyTorch, hardware kits, and upcoming co-labs that connect principles to runnable code and real devices.

## What Makes This Different

This is a living textbook. We keep it updated as the field grows, with community input along the way.

AI may feel like it is moving at lightning speed, but the engineering building blocks that make it work do not change as quickly as the headlines. This project is built around those stable foundations.

Think of it like LEGO. New sets arrive all the time, but the bricks themselves stay the same. Once you learn how the bricks fit together, you can build anything. Here, those &quot;AI bricks&quot; are the solid systems principles that make AI work.

Whether you are reading a chapter, running a lab, or sharing feedback, you are helping make these ideas more accessible to the next learner.

### Research to Teaching Loop

We use the same loop for research and teaching: define the system problem, build a reference implementation, benchmark it, then turn it into curriculum and tooling so others can reproduce and extend it.

| Loop Step | Research Artifacts | Teaching Artifacts |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Measure** | Benchmarks, suites, metrics | Benchmarking chapter, assignments |
| **Build** | Reference systems, compilers, runtimes | TinyTorch modules, co-labs |
| **Deploy** | Hardware targets, constraints, reliability | Hardware labs, kits |

## Support This Work

We are working toward **1 million learners by 2030** so that AI engineering becomes a shared, teachable discipline, not a collection of isolated practices. Every star, share, and contribution helps move this effort forward.

### Why GitHub Stars Matter

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

*What gets measured gets improved.*

Each star is a learner, educator, or supporter who believes AI systems should be engineered with rigor and real world constraints in mind.

[![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/harvard-edge/cs249r_book?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;color=gold)](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/stargazers)

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#harvard-edge/cs249r_book&amp;Date)

1 learner → 10 learners → 100 learners → 1,000 learners → **10,000 learners** → 100,000 learners → **1M learners**

&lt;/div&gt;

Stars are not the goal. They are a signal.

A visible, growing community makes it easier for universities, foundations, and industry partners to adopt this material, donate hardware, and fund workshops. That momentum lowers the barrier for the next institution, the next classroom, and the next cohort of learners.

Support raised through this signal flows into [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook) and funds concrete outcomes such as TinyML4D workshops, hardware kits for underserved classrooms, and the infrastructure required to keep this resource free and open.

One click can unlock the next classroom, the next contributor, and the next generation of AI engineers.

### Fund the Mission

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

All contributions go to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook), a transparent fund that supports educational outreach.

&lt;img src=&quot;./doc/img/logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Hermes logo - large H with wings&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;20%&quot;/&gt;

Hermes is a JavaScript engine optimized for fast start-up of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) apps. It features ahead-of-time static optimization and compact bytecode.

If you&#039;re only interested in using pre-built Hermes in a new or existing React Native app, you do not need to follow this guide or have direct access to the Hermes source. Instead, just follow [these instructions to enable Hermes](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes).

&gt; Noted that each Hermes release is aimed at a specific RN version. The rule of thumb is to always follow [Hermes releases](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/releases) strictly. Version mismatch can result in instant crash of your apps in the worst case scenario.

If you want to know how to build and hack on Hermes directly, and/or integrate Hermes built from source into a React Native app then read on.

The instructions here very briefly cover steps to build the Hermes CLI. They assume you have typical native development tools setup for your OS, and support for cmake and Ninja. For more details of required dependencies, building Hermes with different options, etc. follow these links instead:

* [Building and Running Hermes](doc/BuildingAndRunning.md)
* [Using a custom Hermes build in a React Native app](doc/ReactNativeIntegration.md#using-a-custom-hermes-build-in-a-react-native-app)

To build a local debug version of the Hermes CLI tools the following steps should get you started on macOS/Linux:

```shell
mkdir hermes_workingdir
cd hermes_workingdir
git clone https://github.com/facebook/hermes.git
cmake -S hermes -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build ./build
```

Or if you&#039;re using Windows, the following should get you going in a Git Bash shell:

```shell
mkdir hermes_workingdir
cd hermes_workingdir
git -c core.autocrlf=false clone https://github.com/facebook/hermes.git
cmake -S hermes -B build -G &#039;Visual Studio 16 2019&#039; -A x64
cmake --build ./build
```

You will now be in a directory with the output of building Hermes into CLI tools. From here you can run a piece of JavaScript as follows:

```shell
echo &quot;&#039;use strict&#039;; function hello() { print(&#039;Hello World&#039;); } hello();&quot; | ./bin/hermes
```

- ✅ Fixed result mapping for `retrieveMemories()` flat structure
- ✅ Fixed parameter mismatch (namespace vs domain)
- ✅ 2-3ms query latency with hash embeddings
- ✅ Works without API keys (deterministic 1024-dim embeddings)

### 🧠 **ReasoningBank Integration (agentic-flow@1.5.13)**
- **Node.js Backend**: Replaced WASM with SQLite + better-sqlite3
- **Persistent Storage**: All memories saved to `.swarm/memory.db`
- **Semantic Search**: MMR ranking with 4-factor scoring
- **Database Tables**: patterns, embeddings, trajectories, links
- **Performance**: 2ms queries, 400KB per pattern with embeddings

```bash
# Semantic search now fully functional
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store test &quot;API configuration&quot; --namespace semantic --reasoningbank
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query &quot;configuration&quot; --namespace semantic --reasoningbank
# ✅ Found 3 results (semantic search) in 2ms
```

📚 **Release Notes**: [v2.7.0-alpha.10](./docs/RELEASE-NOTES-v2.7.0-alpha.10.md)

## 🧠 **Memory System Commands**

## Installing

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install axios
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add axios
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
$ pnpm add axios
```

Using jsDelivr CDN:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Using unpkg CDN:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Example

### note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with `require()` use the following approach:

```js
const axios = require(&#039;axios&#039;).default;

// axios.&lt;method&gt; will now provide autocomplete and parameter typings
```

Performing a `GET` request

```js
const axios = require(&#039;axios&#039;).default;

// Make a request for a user with a given ID
axios.get(&#039;/user?ID=12345&#039;)
  .then(function (response) {
    // handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    // handle error
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios.get(&#039;/user&#039;, {
    params: {
      ID: 12345
    }
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });  

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(&#039;/user?ID=12345&#039;);
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

&gt; **NOTE:** `async/await` is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
&gt; Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.

Performing a `POST` request

```js
axios.post(&#039;/user&#039;, {
    firstName: &#039;Fred&#039;,
    lastName: &#039;Flintstone&#039;
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

Performing multiple concurrent requests

```js
function getUserAccount() {
  return axios.get(&#039;/user/12345&#039;);
}

function getUserPermissions() {
  return axios.get(&#039;/user/12345/permissions&#039;);
}

Promise.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()])
  .then(function (results) {
    const acct = results[0];
    const perm = results[1];
  });
```

## axios API

Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to `axios`.

##### axios(config)

```js
// Send a POST request
axios({
  method: &#039;post&#039;,
  url: &#039;/user/12345&#039;,
  data: {
    firstName: &#039;Fred&#039;,
    lastName: &#039;Flintstone&#039;
  }
});
```

```js
// GET request for remote image in node.js
axios({
  method: &#039;get&#039;,
  url: &#039;https://bit.ly/2mTM3nY&#039;,
  responseType: &#039;stream&#039;
})
  .then(function (response) {
    response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(&#039;ada_lovelace.jpg&#039;))
  });
```

##### axios(url[, config])

```js
// Send a GET request (default method)
axios(&#039;/user/12345&#039;);
```

### Request method aliases

For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.

##### axios.request(config)
##### axios.get(url[, config])
##### axios.delete(url[, config])
##### axios.head(url[, config])
##### axios.options(url[, config])
##### axios.post(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios.put(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios.patch(url[, data[, config]])

###### NOTE
When using the alias methods `url`, `method`, and `data` properties don&#039;t need to be specified in config.

### Concurrency (Deprecated)
Please use `Promise.all` to replace the below functions.

Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.

axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)

### Creating an instance

You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.

##### axios.create([config])

```js
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: &#039;https://some-domain.com/api/&#039;,
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: {&#039;X-Custom-Header&#039;: &#039;foobar&#039;}
});
```

### Instance methods

The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.

##### axios#request(config)
##### axios#get(url[, config])
##### axios#delete(url[, config])
##### axios#head(url[, config])
##### axios#options(url[, config])
##### axios#post(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#put(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#patch(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#getUri([config])

## Request Config

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the `url` is required. Requests will default to `GET` if `method` is not specified.

```js
{
  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: &#039;/user&#039;,

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: &#039;get&#039;, // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` unless `url` is absolute.
  // It can be convenient to set `baseURL` for an instance of axios to pass relative URLs
  // to methods of that instance.
  baseURL: &#039;https://some-domain.com/api/&#039;,

  // `transformRequest` allows changes to the request data before it is sent to the server
  // This is only applicable for request methods &#039;PUT&#039;, &#039;POST&#039;, &#039;PATCH&#039; and &#039;DELETE&#039;
  // The last function in the array must return a string or an instance of Buffer, ArrayBuffer,
  // FormData or Stream
  // You may modify the headers object.
  transformRequest: [function (data, headers) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `transformResponse` allows changes to the response data to be made before
  // it is passed to then/catch
  transformResponse: [function (data) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `headers` are custom headers to be sent
  headers: {&#039;X-Requested-With&#039;: &#039;XMLHttpRequest&#039;},

  // `params` are the URL parameters to be sent with the request
  // Must be a plain object or a URLSearchParams object
  params: {
    ID: 12345
  },

  // `paramsSerializer` is an optional config in charge of serializing `params`
  paramsSerializer: {
    indexes: null // array indexes format (null - no brackets, false - empty brackets, true - brackets with indexes)
  },

  // `data` is the data to be sent as the request body
  // Only applicable for request methods &#039;PUT&#039;, &#039;POST&#039;, &#039;DELETE , and &#039;PATCH&#039;
  // When no `transformRequest` is set, must be of one of the following types:
  // - string, plain object, ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, URLSearchParams
  // - Browser only: FormData, File, Blob
  // - Node only: Stream, Buffer
  data: {
    firstName: &#039;Fred&#039;
  },
  
  // syntax alternative to send data into the body
  // method post
  // only the value is sent, not the key
  data: &#039;Country=Brasil&amp;City=Belo Horizonte&#039;,

  // `timeout` specifies the number of milliseconds before the request times out.
  // If the request takes longer than `timeout`, the request will be aborted.
  timeout: 1000, // default is `0` (no timeout)

  // `withCredentials` indicates whether or not cross-site Access-Control requests
  // should be made using credentials
  withCredentials: false, // default

  // `adapter` allows custom handling of requests which makes testing easier.
  // Return a promise and supply a valid response (see lib/adapters/README.md).
  adapter: function (config) {
    /* ... */
  },

  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used, and supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  // Please note that only HTTP Basic auth is configurable through this parameter.
  // For Bearer tokens and such, use `Authorization` custom headers instead.
  auth: {
    username: &#039;janedoe&#039;,
    password: &#039;s00pers3cret&#039;
  },

  // `responseType` indicates the type of data that the server will respond with
  // options are: &#039;arraybuffer&#039;, &#039;document&#039;, &#039;json&#039;, &#039;text&#039;, &#039;stream&#039;
  //   browser only: &#039;blob&#039;
  responseType: &#039;json&#039;, // default

  // `responseEncoding` indicates encoding to use for decoding responses (Node.js only)
  // Note: Ignored for `responseType` of &#039;stream&#039; or client-side requests
  responseEncoding: &#039;utf8&#039;, // default

  // `xsrfCookieName` is the name of the cookie to use as a value for xsrf token
  xsrfCookieName: &#039;XSRF-TOKEN&#039;, // default

  // `xsrfHeaderName` is the name of the http header that carries the xsrf token value
  xsrfHeaderName: &#039;X-XSRF-TOKEN&#039;, // default

  // `onUploadProgress` allows handling of progress events for uploads

  // browser only
  onDownloadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // Do whatever you want with the native progress event
  },

  // `maxContentLength` defines the max size of the http response content in bytes allowed in node.js
  maxContentLength: 2000,

  // `maxBodyLength` (Node only option) defines the max size of the http request content in bytes allowed
  maxBodyLength: 2000,

  // `validateStatus` defines whether to resolve or reject the promise for a given
  // HTTP response status code. If `validateStatus` returns `true` (or is set to `null`
  // or `undefined`), the promise will be resolved; otherwise, the promise will be
  // rejected.
  validateStatus: function (status) {
    return status &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; status &lt; 300; // default
  },

  // `maxRedirects` defines the maximum number of redirects to follow in node.js.
  // If set to 0, no redirects will be followed.
  maxRedirects: 21, // default

  // `beforeRedirect` defines a function that will be called before redirect.
  // Use this to adjust the request options upon redirecting,
  // to inspect the latest response headers,
  // or to cancel the request by throwing an error
  // If maxRedirects is set to 0, `beforeRedirect` is not used.
  beforeRedirect: (options, { headers }) =&gt; {

  // `socketPath` defines a UNIX Socket to be used in node.js.
  // e.g. &#039;/var/run/docker.sock&#039; to send requests to the docker daemon.
  // Only either `socketPath` or `proxy` can be specified.
  // If both are specified, `socketPath` is used.
  socketPath: null, // default

  // `httpAgent` and `httpsAgent` define a custom agent to be used when performing http
  // and https requests, respectively, in node.js. This allows options to be added like
  // `keepAlive` that are not enabled by default.
  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),
  httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),

  // `proxy` defines the hostname, port, and protocol of the proxy server.
  // You can also define your proxy using the conventional `http_proxy` and
  // `https_proxy` environment variables. If you are using environment variables
  // for your proxy configuration, you can also define a `no_proxy` environment
  // variable as a comma-separated list of domains that should not be proxied.
  // Use `false` to disable proxies, ignoring environment variables.
  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used to connect to the proxy, and
  // supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Proxy-Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Proxy-Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  // If the proxy server uses HTTPS, then you must set the protocol to `https`. 
  proxy: {
    protocol: &#039;https&#039;,

  // (see Cancellation section below for details)
  cancelToken: new CancelToken(function (cancel) {
  }),

  // an alternative way to cancel Axios requests using AbortController
  signal: new AbortController().signal,

  // `decompress` indicates whether or not the response body should be decompressed 
  // automatically. If set to `true` will also remove the &#039;content-encoding&#039; header 
  // from the responses objects of all decompressed responses
  // - Node only (XHR cannot turn off decompression)
  decompress: true // default

  // `insecureHTTPParser` boolean.
  // Indicates where to use an insecure HTTP parser that accepts invalid HTTP headers.
  // This may allow interoperability with non-conformant HTTP implementations.
  // Using the insecure parser should be avoided.
  // see options https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/http.html#http_http_request_url_options_callback

      metaTokens: boolean; // keep special endings like {} in parameter key 
      indexes: boolean; // array indexes format null - no brackets, false - empty brackets, true - brackets with indexes
  }
}
```

## Response Schema

The response for a request contains the following information.

```js
{
  // `data` is the response that was provided by the server
  data: {},

  // `status` is the HTTP status code from the server response
  status: 200,

  // `statusText` is the HTTP status message from the server response
  statusText: &#039;OK&#039;,

  // `headers` the HTTP headers that the server responded with
  // All header names are lowercase and can be accessed using the bracket notation.
  // Example: `response.headers[&#039;content-type&#039;]`
  headers: {},

  // `config` is the config that was provided to `axios` for the request
  config: {},

  // `request` is the request that generated this response
  // It is the last ClientRequest instance in node.js (in redirects)
  // and an XMLHttpRequest instance in the browser
  request: {}
}
```

When using `then`, you will receive the response as follows:

```js
axios.get(&#039;/user/12345&#039;)
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response.data);
    console.log(response.status);
    console.log(response.statusText);
    console.log(response.headers);
    console.log(response.config);
  });
```

When using `catch`, or passing a [rejection callback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) as second parameter of `then`, the response will be available through the `error` object as explained in the [Handling Errors](#handling-errors) section.

## Config Defaults

You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.

### Global axios defaults

```js
axios.defaults.bas

A library of string validators and sanitizers.

## Strings only

**This library validates and sanitizes strings only.**

If you&#039;re not sure if your input is a string, coerce it using `input + &#039;&#039;`.
Passing anything other than a string will result in an error.

## Installation and Usage

### Server-side usage

Install the `validator` package as:

```sh
npm i validator
yarn add validator
pnpm i validator
```

#### No ES6

```javascript
var validator = require(&#039;validator&#039;);

validator.isEmail(&#039;foo@bar.com&#039;); //=&gt; true
```

#### ES6

```javascript
import validator from &#039;validator&#039;;
```

Or, import only a subset of the library:

```javascript
import isEmail from &#039;validator/lib/isEmail&#039;;
```

#### Tree-shakeable ES imports

```javascript
import isEmail from &#039;validator/es/lib/isEmail&#039;;
```

### Client-side usage

The library can be loaded either as a standalone script, or through an [AMD][amd]-compatible loader

```html
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;validator.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
  validator.isEmail(&#039;foo@bar.com&#039;); //=&gt; true
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The library can also be installed through [bower][bower]

```bash
$ bower install validator-js
```

CDN

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/validator@latest/validator.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Validators

Here is a list of the validators currently available.

--------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------
**contains(str, seed [, options])**    | check if the string contains the seed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`options` is an object that defaults to `{ ignoreCase: false, minOccurrences: 1 }`.&lt;br /&gt;Options: &lt;br/&gt; `ignoreCase`: Ignore case when doing comparison, default false.&lt;br/&gt;`minOccurrences`: Minimum number of occurrences for the seed in the string. Defaults to 1.
**equals(str, comparison)**             | check if the string matches the comparison.
**isAbaRouting(str)**               | check if the string is an ABA routing number for US bank account / cheque.

## MCP Server

To make it easy to add these customizations to your editor, we have created a [MCP Server](https://developer.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-awesome-copilot-mcp-server) that provides a prompt for searching and installing prompts, instructions, and chat modes directly from this repository. You&#039;ll need to have Docker installed and running to run the server.

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


## Installation

```
npm install @tabler/icons --save
```

or just [download from GitHub](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/releases).

## Usage

All icons are built with SVG, so you can place them as `&lt;img&gt;`, `background-image` and inline in HTML code.

### HTML image

If you load an icon as an image, you can modify its size using CSS.

```html
&lt;img src=&quot;path/to/icon.svg&quot; alt=&quot;icon title&quot; /&gt;
```

### Inline HTML

You can paste the content of the icon file into your HTML code to display it on the page.

```html
&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;svg
    xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;
    class=&quot;icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-disabled&quot;
    width=&quot;24&quot;
    height=&quot;24&quot;
    viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot;
    stroke-width=&quot;1.25&quot;
    stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot;
    fill=&quot;none&quot;
    stroke-linecap=&quot;round&quot;
    stroke-linejoin=&quot;round&quot;
  &gt;
    ...
  &lt;/svg&gt;
  Click me
&lt;/a&gt;
```

Thanks to that, you can change the size, color and the `stroke-width` of the icons with CSS code.

```css
.icon-tabler {
  color: red;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  stroke-width: 1.25;
}
```

### SVG sprite

Add an icon to be displayed on your page with the following markup (`activity` in the above example can be replaced with any valid icon name):

```html
&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
  &lt;use xlink:href=&quot;path/to/tabler-sprite.svg#tabler-activity&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
```

  &lt;IconHome stroke-width=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
// Returns Vue component

  components: { IconHome }
};
&lt;/script&gt;
```

import { TablerIconsModule } from &#039;angular-tabler-icons&#039;;
import { IconCamera, IconHeart, IconBrandGithub } from &#039;angular-tabler-icons/icons&#039;;

// Select some icons (use an object, not an array)
const icons = {
  IconCamera,
  IconHeart,

};

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    TablerIconsModule.pick(icons)
  ],
  exports: [
    TablerIconsModule
  ]
})
export class IconsModule { }
```

### Compiling fonts

To compile fonts first install [fontforge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/).

When compiling the font it will look for a json file `compile-options.json` in root folder (same folder as the `package.json`) In this file you can define extra options:

The default settings if you have not defined the file will be:
```JSON
{
  &quot;includeIcons&quot;: [],
  &quot;fontForge&quot;: &quot;fontforge&quot;,
  &quot;strokeWidth&quot;: null
}
```

The fontforge executable needs to be in the path or you can set the path to the downloaded fontforge executable in the configuration file. If you installed in on a mac in your application directory it will be `/Applications/FontForge.app/Contents/MacOS/FontForge`. You can set this value in the `compile-options.json` file.

```JSON
{
  &quot;fontForge&quot;: &quot;/Applications/FontForge.app/Contents/MacOS/FontForge&quot;
}
```

To compile the fonts run:
```sh
npm run build-iconfont
```

By default the stroke width is 2. You can change the stroke width in the `compile-options.json`
```JSON
{
  &quot;strokeWidth&quot;: 1.5,
}
```

To reduce the font file size you can choose to compile a sub set of icons. When you leave the array empty it will compile all the fonts. To compile only two icons you can set for example the following option in the `compile-options.json`:

```JSON
{
  &quot;includeIcons&quot;: [&quot;alert-octagon&quot;, &quot;alert-triangle&quot;]
}
```

Optional property `includeCategories` - an array or string of icon categories to include, category names are case-insensitive.
```JSON
{
  &quot;includeCategories&quot;: [&quot;Devices&quot;, &quot;System&quot;]
}
```
or
```JSON
{
  &quot;includeCategories&quot;: &quot;Devices System&quot;
}
```

Optional property `excludeIcons` - an array of icon names using to exclude some category icons:
```JSON
{
  &quot;includeCategories&quot;: [&quot;system&quot;],
  &quot;excludeIcons&quot;: [&quot;adjustments&quot;]
}
```

Complex solution:
```JSON
{
  &quot;includeIcons&quot;: [&quot;alert-octagon&quot;, &quot;alert-triangle&quot;],
  &quot;includeCategories&quot;: [&quot;devices&quot;, &quot;system&quot;],
  &quot;excludeIcons&quot;: [&quot;adjustments&quot;]
}
```

### Jetpack Compose

For Android or Desktop you can use [`compose-icons`](https://github.com/DevSrSouza/compose-icons) to use icons in your projects. (see [docs](https://github.com/DevSrSouza/compose-icons/blob/master/tabler-icons/DOCUMENTATION.md))

## Multiple strokes

All icons in this repository have been created with the value of the `stroke-width` property, so if you change the value, you can get different icon variants that will fit in well with your design.

_Works on Windows/macOS/Linux._

Raspberry Pi (3, 4, Zero 2): [requires 64-bit OS](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/3) like Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu (Raspbian won&#039;t work since it&#039;s 32-bit).

## How to run
Easy option: [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (or [podman](https://podman-desktop.io/)) and run this command in a terminal:
```
docker run --rm -it -p 6080:6080 -v fgc:/fgc/data --pull=always ghcr.io/vogler/free-games-claimer
```

_This currently gives you a captcha challenge for epic-games. Until [issue #183](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/183) is fixed, it is recommended to just run `node epic-games` without docker (see below)._

This will run `node epic-games; node prime-gaming; node gog` - if you only want to claim games for one of the stores, you can override the default command by appending e.g. `node epic-games` at the end of the `docker run` command, or if you want several `bash -c &quot;node epic-games.js; node gog.js&quot;`.
Data (including json files with claimed games, codes to redeem, screenshots) is stored in the Docker volume `fgc`.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;I want to run without Docker or develop locally.&lt;/summary&gt;

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Clone/download this repository and `cd` into it in a terminal
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `pip install apprise` (or use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) if you have [problems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75608323/how-do-i-solve-error-externally-managed-environment-every-time-i-use-pip-3)) to install [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) if you want notifications
5. To get updates: `git pull; npm install`
6. Run `node epic-games`, `node prime-gaming`, `node gog`...

During `npm install` Playwright will download its Firefox to a cache in home ([doc](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#managing-browser-binaries)).
If you are missing some dependencies for the browser on your system, you can use `sudo npx playwright install firefox --with-deps`.

If you don&#039;t want to use Docker for quasi-headless mode, you could run inside a virtual machine, on a server, or you wake your PC at night to avoid being interrupted.
&lt;/details&gt;

## Usage
All scripts start an automated Firefox instance, either with the browser GUI shown or hidden (*headless mode*). By default, you won&#039;t see any browser open on your host system.

- When running inside Docker, the browser will be shown only inside the container. You can open http://localhost:6080 to interact with the browser running inside the container via noVNC (or use other VNC clients on port 5900).
- When running the scripts outside of Docker, the browser will be hidden by default; you can use `SHOW=1 ...` to show the UI (see options below).

When running the first time, you have to login for each store you want to claim games on.
You can login indirectly via the terminal or directly in the browser. The scripts will wait until you are successfully logged in.

There will be prompts in the terminal asking you to enter email, password, and afterwards some OTP (one time password / security code) if you have 2FA/MFA (two-/multi-factor authentication) enabled. If you want to login yourself via the browser, you can press escape in the terminal to skip the prompts.

After login, the script will continue claiming the current games. If it still waits after you are already logged in, you can restart it (and open an issue). If you run the scripts regularly, you should not have to login again.

### Configuration / Options
Options are set via [environment variables](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-an-environment-variable/) which allow for flexible configuration.

TODO: ~~On the first run, the script will guide you through configuration and save all settings to `data/config.env`. You can edit this file directly or run `node fgc config` to run the configuration assistant again.~~

See `src/config.js` for all options.

#### How to set options
You can add options directly in the command or put them in a file to load.

##### Docker
You can pass variables using `-e VAR=VAL`, for example `docker run -e EMAIL=foo@bar.baz -e NOTIFY=&#039;tgram://bottoken/ChatID&#039; ...` or using `--env-file fgc.env` where `fgc.env` is a file on your host system (see [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#env)). You can also `docker cp` your configuration file to `/fgc/data/config.env` in the `fgc` volume to store it with the rest of the data instead of on the host ([example](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25245#issuecomment-365980572)).
If you are using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/) (or Portainer etc.), you can put options in the `environment:` section.

##### Without Docker
On Linux/macOS you can prefix the variables you want to set, for example `EMAIL=foo@bar.baz SHOW=1 node epic-games` will show the browser and skip asking you for your login email. On Windows you have to use `set`, [example](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/314).
You can also put options in `data/config.env` which will be loaded by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

### Notifications
The scripts will try to send notifications for successfully claimed games and any errors like needing to log in or encountered captchas (should not happen).

[apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) is used for notifications and offers many services including Pushover, Slack, Telegram, SMS, Email, desktop and custom notifications.
You just need to set `NOTIFY` to the notification services you want to use, e.g. `NOTIFY=&#039;mailto://myemail:mypass@gmail.com&#039; &#039;pbul://o.gn5kj6nfhv736I7jC3cj3QLRiyhgl98b&#039;` - refer to their list of services and [examples](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#command-line-usage).

### Automatic login, two-factor authentication
If you set the options for email, password and OTP key, there will be no prompts and logins should happen automatically. This is optional since all stores should stay logged in since cookies are refreshed.
To get the OTP key, it is easiest to follow the store&#039;s guide for adding an authenticator app. You should also scan the shown QR code with your favorite app to have an alternative method for 2FA.

- **Epic Games**: visit [password &amp; security](https://www.epicgames.com/account/password), enable &#039;third-party authenticator app&#039;, copy the &#039;Manual Entry Key&#039; and use it to set `EG_OTPKEY`.
- **Prime Gaming**: visit Amazon &#039;Your Account › Login &amp; security&#039;, 2-step verification › Manage › Add new app › Can&#039;t scan the barcode, copy the bold key and use it to set `PG_OTPKEY`
- **GOG**: only offers OTP via email
&lt;!-- - **Xbox**: visit [additional security](https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional) &gt; Add a new way to sign in or verify &gt; Use an app &gt; Set up a different Authenticator app &gt; I can&#039;t scan the bar code &gt; copy the bold key and use it to set `XBOX_OTPKEY` --&gt;

Beware that storing passwords and OTP keys as clear text may be a security risk. Use a unique/generated password! TODO: maybe at least offer to base64 encode for storage.

### Epic Games Store
Run `node epic-games` (locally or in Docker).

### Amazon Prime Gaming
Run `node prime-gaming` (locally or in Docker).

Claiming the Amazon Games works out-of-the-box, however, for games on external stores you need to either link your account or redeem a key.

- Stores that require account linking: Epic Games, Battle.net, Origin.
- Stores that require redeeming a key: GOG.com, Microsoft Games, Legacy Games.
  
  Keys and URLs are printed to the console, included in notifications and saved in `data/prime-gaming.json`. A screenshot of the page with the key is also saved to `data/screenshots`.
  [TODO](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/5): ~~redeem keys on external stores.~~

&lt;!-- ### Xbox Games With Gold --&gt;
&lt;!-- Run `node xbox` (locally or in docker). --&gt;

### Run periodically
#### How often?
Epic Games usually has two free games *every week*, before Christmas every day.
Prime Gaming has new games *every month* or more often during Prime days.
GOG usually has one new game every couples of weeks.
Unreal Engine has new assets to claim *every first Tuesday of a month*.
&lt;!-- Xbox usually has two games *every month*. --&gt;

It is safe to run the scripts every day.

#### How to schedule?
The container/scripts will claim currently available games and then exit.
If you want it to run regularly, you have to schedule the runs yourself:

- Linux/macOS: `crontab -e` ([example](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/discussions/56))
- macOS: [launchd](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132955/how-do-i-set-a-task-to-run-every-so-often)
- Windows: [task scheduler](https://active-directory-wp.com/docs/Usage/How_to_add_a_cron_job_on_Windows/Scheduled_tasks_and_cron_jobs_on_Windows/index.html) ([example](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/wiki/%5BHowTo%5D-Schedule-runs-on-Windows)), [other options](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132971/what-is-the-windows-version-of-cron), or just put the command in a `.bat` file in Autostart if you restart often...
- any OS: use a process manager like [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/restart-strategies/)
- Docker Compose `command: bash -c &quot;node epic-games; node prime-gaming; node gog; echo sleeping; sleep 1d&quot;` additionally add `restart: unless-stopped` to it.

TODO: ~~add some server-mode where the script just keeps running and claims games e.g. every day.~~

### Problems?

Check the open [issues](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues) and comment there or open a new issue.

If you&#039;re a developer, you can use `PWDEBUG=1 ...` to [inspect](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector) which opens a debugger where you can step through the script.


## History/DevLog
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

Tried [epicgames-freebies-claimer](https://github.com/Revadike/epicgames-freebies-claimer), but had problems since epicgames introduced hcaptcha (see [issue](https://github.com/Revadike/epicgames-freebies-claimer/issues/172)).

Played around with puppeteer before, now trying newer https://playwright.dev which is pretty similar.
Playwright Inspector and `codegen` to generate scripts are nice, but failed to generate the right code for clicking a button in an iframe.

Added [main.spec.ts](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/e5ce7916ab6329cfc7134677c4d89c2b3fa3ba97#diff-d18d03e9c407a20e05fbf03cbd6f9299857740544fb6b50d6a70b9c6fbc35831) which was the test script generated by `npx playwright codegen` with manual fix for clicking buttons in the created iframe. Can be executed by `npx playwright test`. The test runner has options `--debug` and `--timeout` and can execute typescript which is nice. However, this only worked up to the button &#039;I Agree&#039;, and then showed an hcaptcha.

Added [main.captcha.js](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/e5ce7916ab6329cfc7134677c4d89c2b3fa3ba97#diff-d18d03e9c407a20e05fbf03cbd6f9299857740544fb6b50d6a70b9c6fbc35831) which uses beta of `playwright-extra@next` and `@extra/recaptcha@next` (from [comment on puppeteer-extra](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/pull/303#issuecomment-775277480)).
However, `playwright-extra` seems to be old and missing `:has-text` selector (fixed [here](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/ba97a0e840b65f4476cca18e28d8461b0c703420)) and `page.frameLocator`, so the script did not run without adjustments.
Also, solving via [2captcha](https://2captcha.com?from=13225256) is a paid service which takes time and may be unreliable.
&lt;!-- Alternative: https://anti-captcha.com --&gt;

Added [main.stealth.js](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/64d0ba8ce71baec3947d1b64acd567befcb39340#diff-f70d3bd29df4a343f11062a97063953173491ce30fe34f69a0fc52517adbf342) which uses the stealth plugin without `playwright-extra` wrapper but up-to-date `playwright` (from [comment](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/issues/454#issuecomment-917437212)).
The listed evasions are enough to not show an hcaptcha. Script claimed game successfully in non-headless mode.

Removed `main.captcha.js`.
Using Playwright Test (`main.spec.ts`) instead of Library (`main.stealth.js`) has the advantage of free CLI like `--debug` and `--timeout`.
&lt;!-- TODO: check if stealth plugin can be setup with `contextOptions` ([doc](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#more-browser-and-context-options)). --&gt;

Button selectors should preferably use text in order to be more stable against changes in the DOM.

Renamed repository from epicgames-claimer to free-games-claimer since a script for Amazon Prime Gaming was also added. Removed all old scripts in favor of just `epic-games.js` and `prime-gaming.js`.

epic games: `headless` mode gets hcaptcha challenge. More details/references in [issue](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/2).

https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/pull/11 introduced a Dockerfile for running non-headless inside the container via xvfb which makes it headless for the host running the container.

v1.0 Standalone scripts node epic-games and node prime-gaming using Chromium.

Changed to Firefox for all scripts since Chromium led to captchas. Claiming then also worked in headless mode without Docker.

Added options via env vars, configurable in `data/config.env`.

Added OTP generation via otplib for automatic login, even with 2FA.

Added notifications via [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise).
&lt;/details&gt;

**MagicMirror²** is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the **MagicMirror²** allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. **MagicMirror²** is built by the creator of [the original MagicMirror](https://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror) with the incredible help of a [growing community of contributors](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror/graphs/contributors).

MagicMirror² focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!

Betaflight App is a crossplatform configuration and management application for the Betaflight flight control system.

The Betaflight App is a Progressive Web Application (PWA). The most recent release of the Betaflight App is available at [app.betaflight.com](https://app.betaflight.com)

NOTE: If you are considering testing the latest unstable release then it is at [master.app.betaflight.com](https://master.app.betaflight.com)

Various types of aircraft are supported by the tool and by Betaflight, e.g. quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters and fixed-wing aircraft.

## Historical Releases

These are still available under different operating systems and allows you to configure the Betaflight software running on any supported Betaflight target. [Downloads are available in Releases.](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases)

## Installation

### Standalone

We provide a standalone program for Windows, Linux, Mac and Android.

Download the installer from [Releases.](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases)

### Notes

#### Windows users

The minimum required version of windows is Windows 8.

#### MacOS X users

Changes to the security model used in the latest versions of MacOS X 10.14 (Mojave) and 10.15 (Catalina) mean that the operating system will show an error message (&#039;&quot;Betaflight Configurator.app&quot; is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.&#039;) when trying to install the application. To work around this, run the following command in a terminal after installing: `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Betaflight\ Configurator.app`.

#### Linux users

First step is to download the installer and keep it in your working directory, which can be done with the following command:
```
wget https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/download/10.10.0/betaflight-configurator_10.10.0_amd64.deb
```

In most Linux distributions your user won&#039;t have access to serial interfaces by default. To add this access right type the following command in a terminal, log out your user and log in again:

```
sudo usermod -aG dialout ${USER}
```

Post-installation errors can be prevented by making sure the directory `/usr/share/desktop-directories` exists. To make sure it exists, run the following command before installing the package:

```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/desktop-directories/
```

The `libatomic` library must also be installed before installing Betaflight App. (If the library is missing, the installation will succeed but Betaflight App will not start.) Some Linux distributions (e.g. Fedora) will install it automatically. On Debian or Ubuntu you can install it as follows:

```
sudo apt install libatomic1
```

On Ubuntu 23.10 please follow these alternative steps for installation:

```
sudo echo &quot;deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lunar universe&quot; &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lunar-repos-old.list
sudo apt update
sudo dpkg -i betaflight-configurator_10.10.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get -f install
```

On Ubuntu 24.10 and above, please follow these steps, as some deprecated modules are no longer available through apt on this distro:
```
sudo apt update
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gconf/libgconf-2-4_3.2.6-4ubuntu1_amd64.deb
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gconf/gconf2-common_3.2.6-4ubuntu1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i gconf2-common_3.2.6-4ubuntu1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i libgconf-2-4_3.2.6-4ubuntu1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i betaflight-configurator_10.10.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get -f install
```

#### Graphics Issues

If you experience graphics display problems or smudged/dithered fonts display issues in Betaflight App, try invoking the `betaflight-configurator` executable file with the `--disable-gpu` command line switch. This will switch off hardware graphics acceleration. Likewise, setting your graphics card antialiasing option to OFF (e.g. FXAA parameter on NVidia graphics cards) might be a remedy as well.

### Unstable Testing Versions

The future of the Betaflight App is moving to a PWA (Progressive Web Application). In this way it will be easier to maintain specially to support different devices like phones, tablets. etc. Is a work in progress but you can have access to the latest snapshot in PWA way without installing anything (take into account that some things don&#039;t work and are in development).

- Latest PWA master snapshot of the App: [https://master.app.betaflight.com/](https://master.app.betaflight.com/)

**Be aware that this version is intended for testing / feedback only, and may be buggy or broken, and can cause flight controller settings to be corrupted. Caution is advised when using this version.**

## Languages

**Please do not submit pull requests for translation changes, but read and follow the instructions below!**

Betaflight App has been translated into several languages. The application will try to detect and use your system language if a translation into this language is available. You can help [translating the application into your language](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/tree/master/README.md#translators);

If you prefer to have the application in English or any other language, you can select your desired language in the first screen of the application.

## Build and Development

### Technical details

The next versions of the App will be a modern tool that based on PWA (Progressive Web Application) and uses principally Node, Yarn, Vite and Vue for development and building. For Android we use Capacitor as wrapper over the PWA. To build and develop over it, follow the instructions below.

### Prepare your environment

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (refer to [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc) for minimum required version)
2. Install yarn: `npm install yarn -g`

### PWA version

#### Run development version

1. Change to project folder and run `yarn install`.
2. Run `yarn dev`.

The web app will be available at http://localhost:8000 with full HMR.

#### Run production version

1. Change to project folder and run `yarn install`.
2. Run `yarn build`.
3. Run `yarn preview` after build has finished.

Alternatively you can run `yarn review` to build and preview in one step.

The web app should behave directly as in production, available at http://localhost:8080.

### Android version

NOTE: The Android version is not fully functional yet. It is in development.

#### Prerequisites

You need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) as Capacitor apps are configured and managed through it.

#### Run development version

1. Change to project folder and run `yarn install`.
2. Run `yarn android:run`.

The command will ask for the device to run the app. You need to have some Android virtual machine created or some Android phone [connected using ADB](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb).

As alternative to the step 2, you can execute a `yarn android:open` to open de project into Android Studio and run or debug the app from there.

#### Run development version with live reload

1. Change to project folder and run `yarn install`.
2. Run `yarn dev --host`. It will start the vite server and will show you the IP address where the server is listening.
3. Run `yarn android:dev` 

This will ask for the IP where the server is running (if there are more than one network interfaces). You need to have some Android virtual machine created or some Android phone [connected using ADB](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb).
Any change make in the code will reload the app in the Android device.

### Running tests

`yarn test`

## Support and Developers Channel

            <h2>README</h2><pre># kokoro

An inference library for [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M). You can [`pip install kokoro`](https://pypi.org/project/kokoro/).

&gt; **Kokoro** is an open-weight TTS model with 82 million parameters. Despite its lightweight architecture, it delivers comparable quality to larger models while being significantly faster and more cost-efficient. With Apache-licensed weights, Kokoro can be deployed anywhere from production environments to personal projects.

### Usage
You can run this basic cell on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). [Listen to samples](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/blob/main/SAMPLES.md).
```py
!pip install -q kokoro&gt;=0.9.4 soundfile
!apt-get -qq -y install espeak-ng &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
from kokoro import KPipeline
from IPython.display import display, Audio
import soundfile as sf
import torch
pipeline = KPipeline(lang_code=&#039;a&#039;)
text = &#039;&#039;&#039;

&#039;&#039;&#039;
generator = pipeline(text, voice=&#039;af_heart&#039;)
for i, (gs, ps, audio) in enumerate(generator):
    print(i, gs, ps)
    display(Audio(data=audio, rate=24000, autoplay=i==0))
    sf.write(f&#039;{i}.wav&#039;, audio, 24000)
```
Under the hood, `kokoro` uses [`misaki`](https://pypi.org/project/misaki/), a G2P library at https://github.com/hexgrad/misaki

These were to have an enormous impact, not only because they were associated with Constantine, but also because, as in so many other areas, the decisions taken by Constantine (or in his name) were to have great significance for centuries to come. One of the main issues was the shape that Christian churches were to take, since there was not, apparently, a tradition of monumental church buildings when Constantine decided to help the Christian church build a series of truly spectacular structures. The main form that these churches took was that of the basilica, a multipurpose rectangular structure, based ultimately on the earlier Greek stoa, which could be found in most of the great cities of the empire. Christianity, unlike classical polytheism, needed a large interior space for the celebration of its religious services, and the basilica aptly filled that need. We naturally do not know the degree to which the emperor was involved in the design of new churches, but it is tempting to connect this with the secular basilica that Constantine completed in the Roman forum (the so-called Basilica of Maxentius) and the one he probably built in Trier, in connection with his residence in the city at a time when he was still caesar.

## 部署
### 基于 Docker 进行部署
```shell
# 使用 SQLite 的部署命令：
docker run --name one-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/one-api:/data justsong/one-api
# 使用 MySQL 的部署命令，在上面的基础上添加 `-e SQL_DSN=&quot;root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi&quot;`，请自行修改数据库连接参数，不清楚如何修改请参见下面环境变量一节。
# 例如：
docker run --name one-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e SQL_DSN=&quot;root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi&quot; -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/one-api:/data justsong/one-api
```

其中，`-p 3000:3000` 中的第一个 `3000` 是宿主机的端口，可以根据需要进行修改。

数据和日志将会保存在宿主机的 `/home/ubuntu/data/one-api` 目录，请确保该目录存在且具有写入权限，或者更改为合适的目录。

如果启动失败，请添加 `--privileged=true`，具体参考 https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api/issues/482 。

如果上面的镜像无法拉取，可以尝试使用 GitHub 的 Docker 镜像，将上面的 `justsong/one-api` 替换为 `ghcr.io/songquanpeng/one-api` 即可。

如果你的并发量较大，**务必**设置 `SQL_DSN`，详见下面[环境变量](#环境变量)一节。

更新命令：`docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower -cR`

Nginx 的参考配置：
```
server{
   server_name openai.justsong.cn;  # 请根据实际情况修改你的域名

   location / {
          client_max_body_size  64m;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # 请根据实际情况修改你的端口
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
          proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
          proxy_read_timeout 300s;  # GPT-4 需要较长的超时时间，请自行调整
   }
}
```

之后使用 Let&#039;s Encrypt 的 certbot 配置 HTTPS：
```bash
# Ubuntu 安装 certbot：
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
# 生成证书 &amp; 修改 Nginx 配置
sudo certbot --nginx
# 根据指示进行操作
# 重启 Nginx
sudo service nginx restart
```

初始账号用户名为 `root`，密码为 `123456`。

### 通过宝塔面板进行一键部署
1. 安装宝塔面板9.2.0及以上版本，前往 [宝塔面板](https://www.bt.cn/new/download.html?r=dk_oneapi) 官网，选择正式版的脚本下载安装；
2. 安装后登录宝塔面板，在左侧菜单栏中点击 `Docker`，首次进入会提示安装 `Docker` 服务，点击立即安装，按提示完成安装；
3. 安装完成后在应用商店中搜索 `One-API`，点击安装，配置域名等基本信息即可完成安装；

### 基于 Docker Compose 进行部署

&gt; 仅启动方式不同，参数设置不变，请参考基于 Docker 部署部分

```shell
# 目前支持 MySQL 启动，数据存储在 ./data/mysql 文件夹内
docker-compose up -d

# 查看部署状态
docker-compose ps
```

### 手动部署
1. 从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api/releases/latest) 下载可执行文件或者从源码编译：
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api.git

   # 构建前端
   cd one-api/web/default
   npm install
   npm run build

   # 构建后端
   cd ../..
   go mod download
   go build -ldflags &quot;-s -w&quot; -o one-api
   ````
2. 运行：
   ```shell
   chmod u+x one-api
   ./one-api --port 3000 --log-dir ./logs
   ```
3. 访问 [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) 并登录。初始账号用户名为 `root`，密码为 `123456`。

更加详细的部署教程[参见此处](https://iamazing.cn/page/how-to-deploy-a-website)。

### 多机部署
1. 所有服务器 `SESSION_SECRET` 设置一样的值。
2. 必须设置 `SQL_DSN`，使用 MySQL 数据库而非 SQLite，所有服务器连接同一个数据库。
3. 所有从服务器必须设置 `NODE_TYPE` 为 `slave`，不设置则默认为主服务器。
4. 设置 `SYNC_FREQUENCY` 后服务器将定期从数据库同步配置，在使用远程数据库的情况下，推荐设置该项并启用 Redis，无论主从。
5. 从服务器可以选择设置 `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`，以重定向页面请求到主服务器。
6. 从服务器上**分别**装好 Redis，设置好 `REDIS_CONN_STRING`，这样可以做到在缓存未过期的情况下数据库零访问，可以减少延迟（Redis 集群或者哨兵模式的支持请参考环境变量说明）。
7. 如果主服务器访问数据库延迟也比较高，则也需要启用 Redis，并设置 `SYNC_FREQUENCY`，以定期从数据库同步配置。

环境变量的具体使用方法详见[此处](#环境变量)。

### 宝塔部署教程

详见 [#175](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api/issues/175)。

如果部署后访问出现空白页面，详见 [#97](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api/issues/97)。

### 部署第三方服务配合 One API 使用
&gt; 欢迎 PR 添加更多示例。

#### ChatGPT Next Web
项目主页：https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web

```bash
docker run --name chat-next-web -d -p 3001:3000 yidadaa/chatgpt-next-web
```

注意修改端口号，之后在页面上设置接口地址（例如：https://openai.justsong.cn/ ）和 API Key 即可。

#### ChatGPT Web
项目主页：https://github.com/Chanzhaoyu/chatgpt-web

```bash
docker run --name chatgpt-web -d -p 3002:3002 -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=https://openai.justsong.cn -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx chenzhaoyu94/chatgpt-web
```

注意修改端口号、`OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` 和 `OPENAI_API_KEY`。

#### QChatGPT - QQ机器人
项目主页：https://github.com/RockChinQ/QChatGPT

根据[文档](https://qchatgpt.rockchin.top)完成部署后，在 `data/provider.json`设置`requester.openai-chat-completions.base-url`为 One API 实例地址，并填写 API Key 到 `keys.openai` 组中，设置 `model` 为要使用的模型名称。

运行期间可以通过`!model`命令查看、切换可用模型。

### 部署到第三方平台
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;部署到 Sealos &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&gt; Sealos 的服务器在国外，不需要额外处理网络问题，支持高并发 &amp; 动态伸缩。

点击以下按钮一键部署（部署后访问出现 404 请等待 3~5 分钟）：

[![Deploy-on-Sealos.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labring-actions/templates/main/Deploy-on-Sealos.svg)](https://cloud.sealos.io/?openapp=system-fastdeploy?templateName=one-api)

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;部署到 Zeabur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&gt; Zeabur 的服务器在国外，自动解决了网络的问题，同时免费的额度也足够个人使用

[![Deploy on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/templates/7Q0KO3)

1. 首先 fork 一份代码。
2. 进入 [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com?referralCode=songquanpeng)，登录，进入控制台。
3. 新建一个 Project，在 Service -&gt; Add Service 选择 Marketplace，选择 MySQL，并记下连接参数（用户名、密码、地址、端口）。
4. 复制链接参数，运行 ```create database `one-api` ``` 创建数据库。
5. 然后在 Service -&gt; Add Service，选择 Git（第一次使用需要先授权），选择你 fork 的仓库。
6. Deploy 会自动开始，先取消。进入下方 Variable，添加一个 `PORT`，值为 `3000`，再添加一个 `SQL_DSN`，值为 `&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@tcp(&lt;addr&gt;:&lt;port&gt;)/one-api` ，然后保存。 注意如果不填写 `SQL_DSN`，数据将无法持久化，重新部署后数据会丢失。
7. 选择 Redeploy。
8. 进入下方 Domains，选择一个合适的域名前缀，如 &quot;my-one-api&quot;，最终域名为 &quot;my-one-api.zeabur.app&quot;，也可以 CNAME 自己的域名。
9. 等待部署完成，点击生成的域名进入 One API。

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;部署到 Render&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&gt; Render 提供免费额度，绑卡后可以进一步提升额度

Render 可以直接部署 docker 镜像，不需要 fork 仓库：https://dashboard.render.com

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

## 配置
系统本身开箱即用。

你可以通过设置环境变量或者命令行参数进行配置。

等到系统启动后，使用 `root` 用户登录系统并做进一步的配置。

**Note**：如果你不知道某个配置项的含义，可以临时删掉值以看到进一步的提示文字。

## 使用方法
在`渠道`页面中添加你的 API Key，之后在`令牌`页面中新增访问令牌。

之后就可以使用你的令牌访问 One API 了，使用方式与 [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) 一致。

你需要在各种用到 OpenAI API 的地方设置 API Base 为你的 One API 的部署地址，例如：`https://openai.justsong.cn`，API Key 则为你在 One API 中生成的令牌。

注意，具体的 API Base 的格式取决于你所使用的客户端。

例如对于 OpenAI 的官方库：
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;sk-xxxxxx&quot;
OPENAI_API_BASE=&quot;https://&lt;HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/v1&quot;
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(用户)
    A ---&gt;|使用 One API 分发的 key 进行请求| B(One API)
    B --&gt;|中继请求| C(OpenAI)
    B --&gt;|中继请求| D(Azure)
    B --&gt;|中继请求| E(其他 OpenAI API 格式下游渠道)
    B --&gt;|中继并修改请求体和返回体| F(非 OpenAI API 格式下游渠道)
```

可以通过在令牌后面添加渠道 ID 的方式指定使用哪一个渠道处理本次请求，例如：`Authorization: Bearer ONE_API_KEY-CHANNEL_ID`。
注意，需要是管理员用户创建的令牌才能指定渠道 ID。

不加的话将会使用负载均衡的方式使用多个渠道。

### 环境变量
&gt; One API 支持从 `.env` 文件中读取环境变量，请参照 `.env.example` 文件，使用时请将其重命名为 `.env`。
1. `REDIS_CONN_STRING`：设置之后将使用 Redis 作为缓存使用。
   + 例子：`REDIS_CONN_STRING=redis://default:redispw@localhost:49153`
   + 如果数据库访问延迟很低，没有必要启用 Redis，启用后反而会出现数据滞后的问题。
   + 如果需要使用哨兵或者集群模式：
     + 则需要把该环境变量设置为节点列表，例如：`localhost:49153,localhost:49154,localhost:49155`。
     + 除此之外还需要设置以下环境变量：
       + `REDIS_PASSWORD`：Redis 集群或者哨兵模式下的密码设置。
       + `REDIS_MASTER_NAME`：Redis 哨兵模式下主节点的名称。
2. `SESSION_SECRET`：设置之后将使用固定的会话密钥，这样系统重新启动后已登录用户的 cookie 将依旧有效。
   + 例子：`SESSION_SECRET=random_string`
3. `SQL_DSN`：设置之后将使用指定数据库而非 SQLite，请使用 MySQL 或 PostgreSQL。
   + 例子：
     + MySQL：`SQL_DSN=root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi`
     + PostgreSQL：`SQL_DSN=postgres://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/oneapi`（适配中，欢迎反馈）
   + 注意需要提前建立数据库 `oneapi`，无需手动建表，程序将自动建表。
   + 如果使用本地数据库：部署命令可添加 `--network=&quot;host&quot;` 以使得容器内的程序可以访问到宿主机上的 MySQL。
   + 如果使用云数据库：如果云服务器需要验证身份，需要在连接参数中添加 `?tls=skip-verify`。
   + 请根据你的数据库配置修改下列参数（或者保持默认值）：
     + `SQL_MAX_IDLE_CONNS`：最大空闲连接数，默认为 `100`。
     + `SQL_MAX_OPEN_CONNS`：最大打开连接数，默认为 `1000`。
       + 如果报错 `Error 1040: Too many connections`，请适当减小该值。
     + `SQL_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME`：连接的最大生命周期，默认为 `60`，单位分钟。
4. `LOG_SQL_DSN`：设置之后将为 `logs` 表使用独立的数据库，请使用 MySQL 或 PostgreSQL。
5. `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`：设置之后将重定向页面请求到指定的地址，仅限从服务器设置。
   + 例子：`FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://openai.justsong.cn`
6. `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED`：启用内存缓存，会导致用户额度的更新存在一定的延迟，可选值为 `true` 和 `false`，未设置则默认为 `false`。
   + 例子：`MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED=true`
7. `SYNC_FREQUENCY`：在启用缓存的情况下与数据库同步配置的频率，单位为秒，默认为 `600` 秒。
   + 例子：`SYNC_FREQUENCY=60`
8. `NODE_TYPE`：设置之后将指定节点类型，可选值为 `master` 和 `slave`，未设置则默认为 `master`。
   + 例子：`NODE_TYPE=slave`
9. `CHANNEL_UPDATE_FREQUENCY`：设置之后将定期更新渠道余额，单位为分钟，未设置则不进行更新。
   + 例子：`CHANNEL_UPDATE_FREQUENCY=1440`
10. `CHANNEL_TEST_FREQUENCY`：设置之后将定期检查渠道，单位为分钟，未设置则不进行检查。 
   +例子：`CHANNEL_TEST_FREQUENCY=1440`
11. `POLLING_INTERVAL`：批量更新渠道余额以及测试可用性时的请求间隔，单位为秒，默认无间隔。
    + 例子：`POLLING_INTERVAL=5`
12. `BATCH_UPDATE_ENABLED`：启用数据库批量更新聚合，会导致用户额度的更新存在一定的延迟可选值为 `true` 和 `false`，未设置则默认为 `false`。
    + 例子：`BATCH_UPDATE_ENABLED=true`
    + 如果你遇到了数据库连接数过多的问题，可以尝试启用该选项。
13. `BATCH_UPDATE_INTERVAL=5`：批量更新聚合的时间间隔，单位为秒，默认为 `5`。
    + 例子：`BATCH_UPDATE_INTERVAL=5`
14. 请求频率限制：
    + `GLOBAL_API_RATE_LIMIT`：全局 API 速率限制（除中继请求外），单 ip 三分钟内的最大请求数，默认为 `180`。
    + `GLOBAL_WEB_RATE_LIMIT`：全局 Web 速率限制，单 ip 三分钟内的最大请求数，默认为 `60`。
15. 编码器缓存设置：
    + `TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR`：默认程序启动时会联网下载一些通用的词元的编码，如：`gpt-3.5-turbo`，在一些网络环境不稳定，或者离线情况，可能会导致启动有问题，可以配置此目录缓存数据，可迁移到离线环境。
    + `DATA_GYM_CACHE_DIR`：目前该配置作用与 `TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR` 一致，但是优先级没有它高。
16. `RELAY_TIMEOUT`：中继超时设置，单位为秒，默认不设置超时时间。

## 常见问题
1. 额度是什么？怎么计算的？One API 的额度计算有问题？
   + 额度 = 分组倍率 * 模型倍率 * （提示 token 数 + 补全 token 数 * 补全倍率）
   + 其中补全倍率对于 GPT3.5 固定为 1.33，GPT4 为 2，与官方保持一致。
   + 如果是非流模式，官方接口会返回消耗的总 token，但是你要注意提示和补全的消耗倍率不一样。
   + 注意，One API 的默认倍率就是官方倍率，是已经调整过的。
2. 账户额度足够为什么提示额度不足？
   + 请检查你的令牌额度是否足够，这个和账户额度是分开的。
   + 令牌额度仅供用户设置最大使用量，用户可自由设置。
3. 提示无可用渠道？
   + 请检查的用户分组和渠道分组设置。
   + 以及渠道的模型设置。
4. 渠道测试报错：`invalid character &#039;&lt;&#039; looking for beginning of value`
   + 这是因为返回值不是合法的 JSON，而是一个 HTML 页面。
   + 大概率是你的部署站的 IP 或代理的节点被 CloudFlare 封禁了。
5. ChatGPT Next Web 报错：`Failed to fetch`
   + 部署的时候不要设置 `BASE_URL`。
   + 检查你的接口地址和 API Key 有没有填对。
   + 检查是否启用了 HTTPS，浏览器会拦截 HTTPS 域名下的 HTTP 请求。
6. 报错：`当前分组负载已饱和，请稍后再试`
   + 上游渠道 429 了。
7. 升级之后我的数据会丢失吗？
   + 如果使用 MySQL，不会。
   + 如果使用 SQLite，需要按照我所给的部署命令挂载 volume 持久化 one-api.db 数据库文件，否则容器重启后数据会丢失。
8. 升级之前数据库需要做变更吗？
   + 一般情况下不需要，系统将在初始化的时候自动调整。
   + 如果需要的话，我会在更新日志中说明，并给出脚本。
