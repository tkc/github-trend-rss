            <h2>README</h2><pre># Multiple Window 3D Scene using Three.js

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a unique approach to creating and managing a 3D scene across multiple browser windows using Three.js and localStorage. It&#039;s designed for developers interested in advanced web graphics and window management techniques.

## Features
- 3D scene creation and rendering with Three.js.
- Synchronization of 3D scenes across multiple browser windows.
- Dynamic window management and state synchronization using localStorage.

## Installation
Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to start exploring the 3D scene.

```
git clone https://github.com/bgstaal/multipleWindow3dScene
```
## Usage
The main application logic is contained within `main.js` and `WindowManager.js`. The 3D scene is rendered in `index.html`, which serves as the entry point of the application.

## Structure and Components
- `index.html`: Entry point that sets up the HTML structure and includes the Three.js library and the main script.
- `WindowManager.js`: Core class managing window creation, synchronization, and state management across multiple windows.
- `main.js`: Contains the logic for initializing the 3D scene, handling window events, and rendering the scene.
- `three.r124.min.js`: Minified version of the Three.js library used for 3D graphics rendering.

## Detailed Functionality
- `WindowManager.js` handles the lifecycle of multiple browser windows, including creation, synchronization, and removal. It uses localStorage to maintain state across windows.
- `main.js` initializes the 3D scene using Three.js, manages the window&#039;s resize events, and updates the scene based on window interactions.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance or expand the project are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.

## License
This project is open-sourced under the MIT License.

## Acknowledgments
- The Three.js team for their comprehensive 3D library.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Hiring Without Whiteboards

A list of companies (or teams) that don&#039;t do &quot;whiteboard&quot; interviews. &quot;Whiteboards&quot; is used as a metaphor, and is a _symbol_ for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad – CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category.

The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) [our recommendations](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for ways to conduct better interviews.

### tl;dr

- Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is 👍
- Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is 👎

Please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to be added.

### Duds

If you&#039;ve been through an interview with one of these companies recently, and your experience suggests otherwise from their description, please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to remove them from this list.

### I want to search/sort/filter/group by X!

Check out our [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shr3eGPDm3wGjT2gA)!

Additions to this document that are properly formatted will automatically be pushed and added to Airtable. Keywords from the description will also be extracted. You can see (and contribute!) to the [API here](https://github.com/poteto/hww-api).

Also check out [No Whiteboards](https://www.nowhiteboard.org) to search for jobs at these companies.

![Hue Editor](https://cdn.gethue.com/uploads/2021/02/hue-4.9.png)

# Getting Started

Quick Demos:

* Docker Compose: [Impala](https://gethue.com/blog/quickstart-sql-editor-for-apache-impala/), [Flink SQL](https://gethue.com/blog/sql-querying-live-kafka-logs-and-sending-live-updates-with-flink-sql/), [ksqlDB](https://gethue.com/blog/tutorial-query-live-data-stream-with-kafka-sql/), [Phoenix SQL / HBase](https://gethue.com/blog/querying-live-kafka-data-in-apache-hbase-with-phoenix/), [Spark SQL](https://gethue.com/blog/querying-spark-sql-with-spark-thrift-server-and-hue-editor/)
* Live instance: [demo.gethue.com](https://demo.gethue.com/)

Three ways to start the server then configure the [databases](https://docs.gethue.com/administrator/configuration/connectors/) you want to query:

## Docker
Start Hue in a single click with the [Docker Guide](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/tools/docker/hue) or the
[video blog post](http://gethue.com/getting-started-with-hue-in-2-minutes-with-docker/).

    docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gethue/hue:latest

Now Hue should be up and running on your default Docker IP on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)!

## Kubernetes

    helm repo add gethue https://helm.gethue.com
    helm repo update
    helm install hue gethue/hue

Read more about configurations at [tools/kubernetes](tools/kubernetes/).

## Development

For a very Quick Start go with the [Dev Environment Docker](https://docs.gethue.com/developer/development/#dev-docker).

Or install the [dependencies](https://docs.gethue.com/administrator/installation/dependencies/), clone the repository, build and get the server running.

    # &lt;install OS dependencies&gt;
    git clone https://github.com/cloudera/hue.git
    cd hue
    make apps
    build/env/bin/hue runserver

Now Hue should be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!

Read more in the [documentation](https://docs.gethue.com/developer/development/).

&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;野生 API 文档&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;不断更新中....&lt;/h3&gt;

本项目旨在对 B 站 WEB、APP、TV 等客户端中，散落在世界各地的野生 API 进行收集整理，研究使用方法并对其进行说明，运用了黑箱法、控制变量法、代码逆向分析、拆包及反编译法、网络抓包法等研究办法

本文档探讨的对象是主站业务接口，[官方开放平台](https://openhome.bilibili.com/doc) 和 [直播开放平台](https://open-live.bilibili.com/document/) 均不属于本项目范畴，请移步

B站 API 采用 C/S 结构，大多数接口为 REST API 和 gRPC，少部分接口为 WebSocket；REST API 接口请求数据大多为 url query 表单或 JSON，返回数据大多为 JSON 或 Protobuf，强制使用 https 协议

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the &quot;Modern browsers&quot; version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools &gt; Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.

For an introduction to the PDF.js code, check out the presentation by our
contributor Julian Viereck:

            <h2>README</h2><pre>About
-----
draw.io, this project, is a configurable diagramming/whiteboarding visualization application. draw.io is jointly owned and developed by JGraph Ltd and draw.io AG.

As well as running this project, we run a production-grade deployment of the diagramming interface at https://app.diagrams.net.

License
-----------------

The minified code authored by us in this repo is licensed under an Apache v2 license, but the sources to build those files are not in this repo. This is not an open source project. We do not accept PRs unless one of the maintainers specifically says it&#039;s OK (basically never).

The JGraph provided icons and diagram templates are licensed under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Additional terms may also apply where the icons are originally defined by a third-party copyright holder. We have checked in all cases that the original license allows use in this project. Also see the terms for using the draw.io logo below.

Additional minified JavaScript files and Java libraries are used in this project. All of the licenses are deemed compatible with the Apache 2.0, nothing is GPL or AGPL, due diligence is performed on all third-party code.

We make no copyright claim on the content you create with this software, regardless of the copyright of individual icons used in such content.

Scope of the Project
--------------------

draw.io is a diagramming or whiteboarding application, depending on which theme is selected. It is not an SVG editing app, the SVG export is designed only for embedding in web pages, not for further editing in other tools.

The application is designed to be entirely as-is. draw.io is not suitable as a framework for building other products from, as source code is not provided. For this try either [Tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) or [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).

Note, in particular, we don&#039;t have support for collaborative editing in this project. If this is important, one of the projects above is likely a better choice.

If you are using a draw.io project/product and have issues or questions about the editor itself, the issue tracker and discussion in this GitHub project are likely a good place to look.

Running
-------

One way to run draw.io is to fork this project, [publish the master branch to GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) and the [pages sites](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) will have the full editor functionality (sans the integrations).

Another way is to use [the recommended Docker project](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio) or to download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net).

The full packaged .war of the client and servlets is built when the project is tagged and available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).

Supported Browsers
------------------

draw.io supports Chrome 98+, Firefox 94+, Safari 15.4+, Opera 84+, WebView Android 98+, Safari iOS 15.4+ and Edge 98+.

Logo and trademark usage
------------------------

draw.io is a registered EU trademark, #018062448

Do not use the draw.io name or any draw.io logo in a way that suggests you are JGraph, your offering or project is by JGraph, or that JGraph is endorsing you or your offering or project.

Do not use any draw.io logo as the icon or logo for your business/organization, offering, project, domain name, social media account, or website.

Do not modify the permitted draw.io logos, including changing the color, dimensions, or combining with other words or design elements.

Do not use JGraph trademarks or logos without JGraph’s prior written permission.

![Tavily MCP Demo](./assets/mcp-demo.gif)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI systems to interact seamlessly with various data sources and tools, facilitating secure, two-way connections.

Developed by Anthropic, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI assistants like Claude to seamlessly integrate with Tavily&#039;s advanced search and data extraction capabilities. This integration provides AI models with real-time access to web information, complete with sophisticated filtering options and domain-specific search features.

The Tavily MCP server provides:
- Seamless interaction with the tavily-search and tavily-extract tools
- Real-time web search capabilities through the tavily-search tool
- Intelligent data extraction from web pages via the tavily-extract tool

## Tavily MCP server installation ⚡

### Running with NPX 

```bash
npx -y tavily-mcp@0.1.4  
```

### Installing via Smithery

To install Tavily MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@tavily-ai/tavily-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @tavily-ai/tavily-mcp --client claude
```

Although you can launch a server on its own, it&#039;s not particularly helpful in isolation. Instead, you should integrate it into an MCP client. Below is an example of how to configure the Claude Desktop app to work with the tavily-mcp server.


## Configuring MCP Clients ⚙️

This repository will explain how to configure [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) to work with the tavily-mcp server.

### Configuring VS Code 💻

For one-click installation, click one of the install buttons below:

[![Install with NPX in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-NPM-0098FF?style=flat-square&amp;logo=visualstudiocode&amp;logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=tavily&amp;config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22tavily-mcp%400.1.4%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22TAVILY_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atavily_api_key%7D%22%7D%7D&amp;inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22tavily_api_key%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Tavily+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D) [![Install with NPX in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-NPM-24bfa5?style=flat-square&amp;logo=visualstudiocode&amp;logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=tavily&amp;config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22tavily-mcp%400.1.4%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22TAVILY_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atavily_api_key%7D%22%7D%7D&amp;inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22tavily_api_key%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Tavily+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&amp;quality=insiders)

### Manual Installation

First check if there are install buttons at the top of this section that match your needs. If you prefer manual installation, follow these steps:

Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

```json
{
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;inputs&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;tavily_api_key&quot;,
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Tavily API Key&quot;,
        &quot;password&quot;: true
      }
    ],
    &quot;servers&quot;: {
      &quot;tavily&quot;: {
        &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;tavily-mcp@0.1.4&quot;],
        &quot;env&quot;: {
          &quot;TAVILY_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;${input:tavily_api_key}&quot;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  &quot;inputs&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;tavily_api_key&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Tavily API Key&quot;,
      &quot;password&quot;: true
    }
  ],
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;tavily&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;tavily-mcp@0.1.4&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;TAVILY_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;${input:tavily_api_key}&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring Cline 🤖

The easiest way to set up the Tavily MCP server in Cline is through the marketplace with a single click:

1. Open Cline in VS Code
2. Click on the Cline icon in the sidebar
3. Navigate to the &quot;MCP Servers&quot; tab ( 4 squares )
4. Search &quot;Tavily&quot; and click &quot;install&quot;
5. When prompted, enter your Tavily API key

Alternatively, you can manually set up the Tavily MCP server in Cline:

1. Open the Cline MCP settings file:

   ### For macOS:
   ```bash
   # Using Visual Studio Code
   code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json
   
   # Or using TextEdit
   open -e ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json
   ```

   ### For Windows:
   ```bash
   code %APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json
   ```

2. Add the Tavily server configuration to the file:

   Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com/api-keys).

   ```json
   {
     &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
       &quot;tavily-mcp&quot;: {
         &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
         &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;tavily-mcp@0.1.4&quot;],
         &quot;env&quot;: {
           &quot;TAVILY_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
         },
         &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
         &quot;autoApprove&quot;: []
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Cline if it&#039;s already running.

4. When using Cline, you&#039;ll now have access to the Tavily MCP tools. You can ask Cline to use the tavily-search and tavily-extract tools directly in your conversations.


### Configuring Cursor 🖥️

&gt; **Note**: Requires Cursor version 0.45.6 or higher

To set up the Tavily MCP server in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Navigate to Features &gt; MCP Servers
3. Click on the &quot;+ Add New MCP Server&quot; button
4. Fill out the following information:
   - **Name**: Enter a nickname for the server (e.g., &quot;tavily-mcp&quot;)
   - **Type**: Select &quot;command&quot; as the type
   - **Command**: Enter the command to run the server:
     ```bash
     env TAVILY_API_KEY=your-api-key npx -y tavily-mcp@0.1.4
     ```
     &gt; **Important**: Replace `your-api-key` with your Tavily API key. You can get one at [app.tavily.com/home](https://app.tavily.com/home)

After adding the server, it should appear in the list of MCP servers. You may need to manually press the refresh button in the top right corner of the MCP server to populate the tool list.

The Composer Agent will automatically use the Tavily MCP tools when relevant to your queries. It is better to explicitly request to use the tools by describing what you want to do (e.g., &quot;User tavily-search to search the web for the latest news on AI&quot;). On mac press command + L to open the chat, select the composer option at the top of the screen, beside the submit button select agent and submit the query when ready.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

### Common Issues

1. **Server Not Found**
   - Verify the npm installation by running `npm --verison`
   - Check Claude Desktop configuration syntax by running `code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Ensure Node.js is properly installed by running `node --version`
   
2. **NPX related issues**
  - If you encounter errors related to `npx`, you may need to use the full path to the npx executable instead. 
  - You can find this path by running `which npx` in your terminal, then replace the `&quot;command&quot;:  &quot;npx&quot;` line with `&quot;command&quot;: &quot;/full/path/to/npx&quot;` in your configuration.

3. **API Key Issues**
   - Confirm your Tavily API key is valid
   - Check the API key is correctly set in the config
   - Verify no spaces or quotes around the API key
