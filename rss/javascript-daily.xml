            <h2>README</h2><pre># OpenAI Realtime Console

This is an example application showing how to use the [OpenAI Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) with [WebRTC](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc).

## Installation and usage

Before you begin, you&#039;ll need an OpenAI API key - [create one in the dashboard here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/api-keys). Create a `.env` file from the example file and set your API key in there:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Running this application locally requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed. Install dependencies for the application with:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the application server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This should start the console application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

This application is a minimal template that uses [express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve the React frontend contained in the [`/client`](./client) folder. The server is configured to use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to build the React frontend.

This application shows how to send and receive Realtime API events over the WebRTC data channel and configure client-side function calling. You can also view the JSON payloads for client and server events using the logging panel in the UI.

For a more comprehensive example, see the [OpenAI Realtime Agents](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-agents) demo built with Next.js, using an agentic architecture inspired by [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm).

## Previous WebSockets version

The previous version of this application that used WebSockets on the client (not recommended in browsers) [can be found here](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console/tree/websockets).

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

- ESLint uses [Espree](https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/espree) for JavaScript parsing.
- ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
- ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`^18.18.0`, `^20.9.0`, or `&gt;=21.1.0`) built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)

You can install and configure ESLint using this command:

```shell
npm init @eslint/config@latest
```

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:

```shell
npx eslint yourfile.js
```

### pnpm Installation

To use ESLint with pnpm, we recommend setting up a `.npmrc` file with at least the following settings:

```text
auto-install-peers=true
node-linker=hoisted
```

This ensures that pnpm installs dependencies in a way that is more compatible with npm and is less likely to produce errors.

## Configuration

You can configure rules in your `eslint.config.js` files as in this example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from &quot;eslint/config&quot;;

export default defineConfig([
	{
		files: [&quot;**/*.js&quot;, &quot;**/*.cjs&quot;, &quot;**/*.mjs&quot;],
		rules: {
			&quot;prefer-const&quot;: &quot;warn&quot;,
			&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
		},
	},
]);
```

The names `&quot;prefer-const&quot;` and `&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;` are the names of [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules) in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:

- `&quot;off&quot;` or `0` - turn the rule off
- `&quot;warn&quot;` or `1` - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn&#039;t affect exit code)
- `&quot;error&quot;` or `2` - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the [configuration docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)).

## Version Support

The ESLint team provides ongoing support for the current version and six months of limited support for the previous version. Limited support includes critical bug fixes, security issues, and compatibility issues only.

ESLint offers commercial support for both current and previous versions through our partners, [Tidelift][tidelift] and [HeroDevs][herodevs].

See [Version Support](https://eslint.org/version-support) for more details.

## Code of Conduct

ESLint adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://eslint.org/conduct).

## Filing Issues

Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you&#039;re reporting:

- [Bug Report](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/report-bugs)
- [Propose a New Rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-new-rule)
- [Proposing a Rule Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-rule-change)
- [Request a Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/request-change)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does ESLint support JSX?

Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)). Please note that supporting JSX syntax _is not_ the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn&#039;t recognize. We recommend using [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react) if you are using React and want React semantics.

### Does Prettier replace ESLint?

No, ESLint and Prettier have different jobs: ESLint is a linter (looking for problematic patterns) and Prettier is a code formatter. Using both tools is common, refer to [Prettier&#039;s documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install#eslint-and-other-linters) to learn how to configure them to work well with each other.

### What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?

ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5, and every year from 2015 up until the most recent stage 4 specification (the default). You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax and other settings (like global variables) through [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure).

### What about experimental features?

ESLint&#039;s parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.

In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use [@babel/eslint-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser) and [@babel/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-plugin) to use any option available in Babel.

Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the [TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/)), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our [contributing guidelines](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute). Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.

### Which Node.js versions does ESLint support?

ESLint updates the supported Node.js versions with each major release of ESLint. At that time, ESLint&#039;s supported Node.js versions are updated to be:

1. The most recent maintenance release of Node.js
1. The lowest minor version of the Node.js LTS release that includes the features the ESLint team wants to use.
1. The Node.js Current release

ESLint is also expected to work with Node.js versions released after the Node.js Current release.

Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#prerequisites) for the officially supported Node.js versions for a given ESLint release.

### Where to ask for help?

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions) or stop by our [Discord server](https://eslint.org/chat).

### Why doesn&#039;t ESLint lock dependency versions?

Lock files like `package-lock.json` are helpful for deployed applications. They ensure that dependencies are consistent between environments and across deployments.

Packages like `eslint` that get published to the npm registry do not include lock files. `npm install eslint` as a user will respect version constraints in ESLint&#039;s `package.json`. ESLint and its dependencies will be included in the user&#039;s lock file if one exists, but ESLint&#039;s own lock file would not be used.

We intentionally don&#039;t lock dependency versions so that we have the latest compatible dependency versions in development and CI that our users get when installing ESLint in a project.

The Twilio blog has a [deeper dive](https://www.twilio.com/blog/lockfiles-nodejs) to learn more.

## Releases

We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a [release issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arelease) for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.

## Security Policy

ESLint takes security seriously. We work hard to ensure that ESLint is safe for everyone and that security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly. Read the full [security policy](https://github.com/eslint/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Semantic Versioning Policy

ESLint follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it&#039;s not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we&#039;ve defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint:

- Patch release (intended to not break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer linting errors.
    - A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).
    - Improvements to documentation.
    - Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.
    - Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn&#039;t work for anyone).
- Minor release (might break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors.
    - A new rule is created.
    - A new option to an existing rule that does not result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - A new addition to an existing rule to support a newly-added language feature (within the last 12 months) that will result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing rule is deprecated.
    - A new CLI capability is created.
    - New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).
    - A new formatter is created.
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and will result in strictly fewer linting errors (e.g., rule removals).
- Major release (likely to break your lint build)
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and may result in new linting errors (e.g., rule additions, most rule option updates).
    - A new option to an existing rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing formatter is removed.
    - Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. The public API includes:
        - Rule schemas
        - Configuration schema
        - Command-line options
        - Node.js API
        - Rule, formatter, parser, plugin APIs

According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` e.g. `&quot;eslint&quot;: &quot;~3.1.0&quot;` to guarantee the results of your builds.

  &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Anime.js&lt;/em&gt; is a fast, multipurpose and lightweight JavaScript animation library with a simple, yet powerful API.&lt;br&gt;
  It works with CSS properties, SVG, DOM attributes and JavaScript Objects.
  &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

## Usage

Anime.js V4 works by importing ES modules like so:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;

```javascript
import {
  animate,
  stagger,
} from &#039;animejs&#039;;

animate(&#039;.square&#039;, {
  x: 320,
  rotate: { from: -180 },
  duration: 1250,
  delay: stagger(65, { from: &#039;center&#039; }),
  ease: &#039;inOutQuint&#039;,
  loop: true,
  alternate: true
});
```

  &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Anime.js code example&quot; src=&quot;./assets/images/usage-example-result.gif&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

## V4 Documentation

The full documentation is available [here](https://animejs.com/documentation).

## V3 Migration guide

You can find the v3 to v4 migration guide [here](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime/wiki/Migrating-from-v3-to-v4).

## NPM development scripts

First, run `npm i` to install all the necessary packages.
Then, execute the following scripts with `npm run &lt;script&gt;`.

| script | action |
| ------ | ------ |
| `dev` | Watch any changes in `src/` and compiles the esm version to `lib/anime.esm.js` |
| `dev-types` | Same as `dev`, but also run TypeScript and generate the `types/index.d.ts` file |
| `build` | Generate types definition and compiles ESM / UMD / IIFE versions to `lib/` |
| `test-browser` | Start a local server and start all browser related tests |
| `test-node` | Start all Node related tests |
| `open-examples` | Start a local server to browse the examples locally |

## Community Edition

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. We run a hosted version at [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com), but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.

## Enterprise

If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises). It also includes more features for security (SSO with LDAP or SAML), administration and collaboration (e.g. tracked changes). [Find out more!](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises)

## Keeping up to date

Sign up to the [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/overleaf.com/community-edition-and-server-pro) to get updates on Overleaf releases and development.

## Installation

We have detailed installation instructions in the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/).

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Overleaf, please see the [Release Notes section on the Wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki#release-notes) for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.

## Overleaf Docker Image

This repo contains two dockerfiles, [`Dockerfile-base`](server-ce/Dockerfile-base), which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex-base` image, and [`Dockerfile`](server-ce/Dockerfile) which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex` (or &quot;community&quot;) image.

The Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like `wget`, plus `texlive`.
We split this out because it&#039;s a pretty heavy set of
dependencies, and it&#039;s nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time.

The `sharelatex/sharelatex` image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code
and services.

Use `make build-base` and `make build-community` from `server-ce/` to build these images.

We use the [Phusion base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)
(which is extended by our `base` image) to provide us with a VM-like container
in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the `runit` service
manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the `server-ce/runit`
folder.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

For information on using Node.js, see the [Node.js website][].

The Node.js project uses an [open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md). The
[OpenJS Foundation][] provides support for the project.

Contributors are expected to act in a collaborative manner to move
the project forward. We encourage the constructive exchange of contrary
opinions and compromise. The [TSC](./GOVERNANCE.md#technical-steering-committee)
reserves the right to limit or block contributors who repeatedly act in ways
that discourage, exhaust, or otherwise negatively affect other participants.

**This project has a [Code of Conduct][].**

## Support

Looking for help? Check out the
[instructions for getting support](.github/SUPPORT.md).

## Release types

* **Current**: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
  branch for its major version number (for example,
  [v22.x](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v22.x)). Node.js releases a new
  major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
  April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
  life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
  each October.
* **LTS**: Releases that receive Long Term Support, with a focus on stability
  and security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.
  LTS releases receive 12 months of _Active LTS_ support and a further 18 months
  of _Maintenance_. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered code names,
  beginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,
  except in some special circumstances.
* **Nightly**: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are
  changes. Use with caution.

Current and LTS releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). A
member of the Release Team [signs](#release-keys) each Current and LTS release.
For more information, see the
[Release README](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#readme).

### Download

Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
&lt;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&gt;.

#### Current and LTS releases

&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/release/&gt;

The [latest](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest/) directory is an
alias for the latest Current release. The latest-_codename_ directory is an
alias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the
[latest-hydrogen](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-hydrogen/)
directory contains the latest Hydrogen (Node.js 18) release.

#### Nightly releases

&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/&gt;

Each directory and filename includes the version (e.g., `v22.0.0`),
followed by the UTC date (e.g., `20240424` for April 24, 2024),
and the short commit SHA of the HEAD of the release (e.g., `ddd0a9e494`).
For instance, a full directory name might look like `v22.0.0-nightly20240424ddd0a9e494`.

#### API documentation

Documentation for the latest Current release is at &lt;https://nodejs.org/api/&gt;.
Version-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the
_docs_ subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at
&lt;https://nodejs.org/download/docs/&gt;.

### Verifying binaries

Download directories contain a `SHASUMS256.txt` file with SHA checksums for the
files.

To download `SHASUMS256.txt` using `curl`:

```bash
curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt
```

To check that downloaded files match the checksum, use `sha256sum`:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHASUMS256.txt --ignore-missing
```

For Current and LTS, the GPG detached signature of `SHASUMS256.txt` is in
`SHASUMS256.txt.sig`. You can use it with `gpg` to verify the integrity of
`SHASUMS256.txt`. You will first need to import
[the GPG keys of individuals authorized to create releases](#release-keys).

See [Release keys](#release-keys) for commands to import active release keys.

Next, download the `SHASUMS256.txt.sig` for the release:

```bash
curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt.sig
```

Then use `gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.sig SHASUMS256.txt` to verify
the file&#039;s signature.

This project comes as a pre-built docker image that enables you to easily forward to your websites
running at home or otherwise, including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx or Letsencrypt.

## Project Goal

I created this project to fill a personal need to provide users with an easy way to accomplish reverse
proxying hosts with SSL termination and it had to be so easy that a monkey could do it. This goal hasn&#039;t changed.
While there might be advanced options they are optional and the project should be as simple as possible
so that the barrier for entry here is low.

## Features

- Beautiful and Secure Admin Interface based on [Tabler](https://tabler.github.io/)
- Easily create forwarding domains, redirections, streams and 404 hosts without knowing anything about Nginx
- Free SSL using Let&#039;s Encrypt or provide your own custom SSL certificates
- Access Lists and basic HTTP Authentication for your hosts
- Advanced Nginx configuration available for super users
- User management, permissions and audit log


## Hosting your home network

I won&#039;t go in to too much detail here but here are the basics for someone new to this self-hosted world.

1. Your home router will have a Port Forwarding section somewhere. Log in and find it
2. Add port forwarding for port 80 and 443 to the server hosting this project
3. Configure your domain name details to point to your home, either with a static ip or a service like DuckDNS or [Amazon Route53](https://github.com/jc21/route53-ddns)
4. Use the Nginx Proxy Manager as your gateway to forward to your other web based services

## Quick Setup

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose

- [Docker Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker-Compose Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file similar to this:

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: &#039;docker.io/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest&#039;
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - &#039;80:80&#039;
      - &#039;81:81&#039;
      - &#039;443:443&#039;
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

This is the bare minimum configuration required. See the [documentation](https://nginxproxymanager.com/setup/) for more.

3. Bring up your stack by running

```bash
docker-compose up -d

# If using docker-compose-plugin
docker compose up -d

```

4. Log in to the Admin UI

When your docker container is running, connect to it on port `81` for the admin interface.
Sometimes this can take a little bit because of the entropy of keys.

[http://127.0.0.1:81](http://127.0.0.1:81)

Default Admin User:
```
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme
```

Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify your details and change your password.

Hey all,

We are taking the next step in saying thank you and goodbye to our friend `react-beautiful-dnd`.

- 🔔 We will be soon deprecating `react-beautiful-dnd` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd). When we do you will start to get console warnings in your build tools.
- 🔒 On Apr 30, 2025 (six months from posting) we will [archiving](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) the `react-beautiful-dnd` Github repository (it will become read only).

Thank you everybody for your support of this project.

## Motivation 🤔

`react-beautiful-dnd` exists to create beautiful drag and drop for lists that anyone can use - even people who cannot see. For a good overview of the history and motivations of the project you can take a look at these external resources:

- 📖 [Rethinking drag and drop](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/rethinking-drag-and-drop-d9f5770b4e6b)
- 🎧 [React podcast: fast, accessible and beautiful drag and drop](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/17)

## Not for everyone ✌️

There are a lot of libraries out there that allow for drag and drop interactions within React. Most notable of these is the amazing [`react-dnd`](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd). It does an incredible job at providing a great set of drag and drop primitives which work especially well with the [wildly inconsistent](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html) html5 drag and drop feature. `react-beautiful-dnd` is a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). Within that subset of functionality `react-beautiful-dnd` offers a powerful, natural and beautiful drag and drop experience. However, it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. So `react-beautiful-dnd` might not be for you depending on what your use case is.

## 🔧 How to Install

### 🐳 Docker

```bash
docker run -d --restart=always -p 3001:3001 -v uptime-kuma:/app/data --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma:1
```

Uptime Kuma is now running on &lt;http://0.0.0.0:3001&gt;.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; File Systems like **NFS** (Network File System) are **NOT** supported. Please map to a local directory or volume.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you want to limit exposure to localhost (without exposing port for other users or to use a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/Reverse-Proxy)), you can expose the port like this:
&gt; 
&gt; ```bash
&gt; docker run -d --restart=always -p 127.0.0.1:3001:3001 -v uptime-kuma:/app/data --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma:1
&gt; ```

## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like &quot;Uptime Robot&quot;, but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

## Features

:eyeglasses: **Virtual Reality Made Simple**: A-Frame handles the 3D and WebXR
boilerplate required to get running across platforms including mobile, desktop, and all headsets (compatible with a WebXR capable browser) just by dropping in `&lt;a-scene&gt;`.

:heart: **Declarative HTML**: HTML is easy to read and copy-and-paste. Since
A-Frame can be used from HTML, A-Frame is accessible to everyone: web
developers, VR and AR enthusiasts, educators, artists, makers, kids.

:electric_plug: **Entity-Component Architecture**: A-Frame is a powerful
framework on top of three.js, providing a declarative, composable, reusable
entity-component structure for three.js. While A-Frame can be used from HTML,
developers have unlimited access to JavaScript, DOM APIs, three.js, WebXR, and
WebGL.

:zap: **Performance**: A-Frame is a thin framework on top of three.js.
Although A-Frame uses the DOM, A-Frame does not touch the browser layout
engine. Performance is a top priority, being battle-tested on highly
interactive WebXR experiences.

:globe_with_meridians: **Cross-Platform**: Build VR and AR applications for any headset compatible with a WebXR capable browser. Don&#039;t have a headset or controllers? No
problem! A-Frame still works on standard desktop and smartphones.

:mag: **Visual Inspector**: A-Frame provides a built-in visual 3D inspector
with a workflow similar to a browser&#039;s developer tools and interface similar to
Unity. Open up any A-Frame scene and hit `&lt;ctrl&gt; + &lt;alt&gt; + i`.

:runner: **Features**: Hit the ground running with A-Frame&#039;s built-in
components such as geometries, materials, lights, animations, models,
raycasters, shadows, positional audio, tracked controllers. Get even further
with community components such as particle systems, physics, multiuser, oceans,
mountains, speech recognition, or teleportation!

## Usage

### Example

Build VR and AR scenes in the browser with just a few lines of HTML! To start playing
and publishing now, remix the starter example on:

[![Remix](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674727/24572421/688f7fc0-162d-11e7-8a35-b02bc050c043.jpg)](https://glitch.com/~aframe)
```html
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;https://aframe.io/releases/1.7.1/aframe.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a-scene&gt;
      &lt;a-box position=&quot;-1 0.5 -3&quot; rotation=&quot;0 45 0&quot; color=&quot;#4CC3D9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-box&gt;
      &lt;a-sphere position=&quot;0 1.25 -5&quot; radius=&quot;1.25&quot; color=&quot;#EF2D5E&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-sphere&gt;
      &lt;a-cylinder position=&quot;1 0.75 -3&quot; radius=&quot;0.5&quot; height=&quot;1.5&quot; color=&quot;#FFC65D&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-cylinder&gt;
      &lt;a-plane position=&quot;0 0 -4&quot; rotation=&quot;-90 0 0&quot; width=&quot;4&quot; height=&quot;4&quot; color=&quot;#7BC8A4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-plane&gt;
      &lt;a-sky color=&quot;#ECECEC&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-sky&gt;
    &lt;/a-scene&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

With A-Frame&#039;s [entity-component
architecture](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.1/introduction/entity-component-system.html), we can drop in community
components from the ecosystem (e.g., ocean, physics) and plug them into our
objects straight from HTML:

```html
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;https://aframe.io/releases/1.7.1/aframe.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/@c-frame/aframe-particle-system-component@1.2.x/dist/aframe-particle-system-component.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/c-frame/aframe-extras@7.5.0/dist/aframe-extras.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fern-solutions/aframe-sky-background/dist/sky-background.umd.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a-scene&gt;
      &lt;a-entity id=&quot;rain&quot; particle-system=&quot;preset: rain; color: #24CAFF; particleCount: 5000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;

      &lt;a-entity id=&quot;sphere&quot; geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere&quot;
                material=&quot;color: #EFEFEF; shader: flat&quot;
                position=&quot;0 0.15 -5&quot;
                light=&quot;type: point; intensity: 5&quot;
                animation=&quot;property: position; easing: easeInOutQuad; dir: alternate; dur: 1000; to: 0 -0.10 -5; loop: true&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;

      &lt;a-entity id=&quot;ocean&quot; ocean=&quot;density: 20; width: 50; depth: 50; speed: 4&quot;
                material=&quot;color: #9CE3F9; opacity: 0.75; metalness: 0; roughness: 1&quot;
                rotation=&quot;-90 0 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;

      &lt;a-sky-background top-color=&quot;#EBEBF5&quot; bottom-color=&quot;#B9B9D2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-sky-background&gt;

      &lt;a-entity id=&quot;light&quot; light=&quot;type: ambient; color: #888&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;
    &lt;/a-scene&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

### Builds

To use the latest stable build of A-Frame, include [`aframe.min.js`](https://aframe.io/releases/1.7.1/aframe.min.js):

```js
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;https://aframe.io/releases/1.7.1/aframe.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
```

To check out the stable and master builds, see the [`dist/` folder](dist/).

### npm

```sh
npm install --save aframe
# Or yarn add aframe
```

```js
import AFRAME from &#039;aframe&#039;;  // e.g., with Webpack or Vite.
```

## Local Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aframevr/aframe.git  # Clone the repository.
cd aframe &amp;&amp; npm install  # Install dependencies.
npm start  # Start the local development server.
```

And open in your browser [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

If you want to test the examples in VR, you need to run it with https:

```sh
npm run start:https
```

Look at the &quot;On Your Network (IPv4)&quot; line in the console, and copy and paste
the url to https://hmd.link service.
Then open the browser in your headset and type hmd.link in the address bar
then click on the copied url that will show up if you&#039;re connected to the same
network as your machine.
You will see a message about the page being dangerous because we&#039;re using a
self-signed certificate, you can ignore that warning and continue to the page.

### Generating Builds

```sh
npm run dist
```

## 💽 安装

1. 安装用户脚本管理器。
1. 打开浏览器的开发者模式。
1. 然后再点击链接之一，安装脚本即可。
    - [GitHub 中文化插件 - GitHub 托管【开发版】][main.user.js]
    - [GitHub 中文化插件 - GreasyFork 托管【发布版】][main(greasyfork).user.js]
1. 刷新下页面，即可发现网站已中文化。

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 1. **开发版**：通常比**发布版**更早进入开发和测试阶段（重大版本更新前，还会专门创建新分支进行测试）。日常维护词库内容，并且词库版本号会在每周五凌晨自动更新。
&gt;    &gt; 注意: 
&gt;    &gt; - 如果版本号未更新，即使内容已更新，用户脚本管理器仍会忽略这些更新，需要手动安装以获取最新内容。
&gt; 1. **发布版**: 日常功能被冻结（除非由项目所有者进行更新）。通常在**开发版**词库版本号更新后的下周一凌晨，自动同步上一**开发版**的词库文件。通常情况下，**发布版**与**开发版**之间会存在一周的时间差。

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; ### 关于 “Chrome 127 及更高版本无法使用” 的问题
&gt; 这是由于 Chrome 127 及更高版本逐步切换到 Manifest V3。目前已知脚本管理器 [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] 5.2.0 及以上版本能够完美支持，而其他脚本管理器（如 Violentmonkey 等）可能无法正常运行此脚本。如果您使用的是其他脚本管理器，建议您改用支持 Manifest V3 的脚本管理器，或者将浏览器版本退回，等待相关脚本管理器开发者更新，或改用 Firefox 浏览器。详情请参阅 [#234](https://github.com/maboloshi/github-chinese/issues/234) 讨论。
&gt; #### 解决方案：
&gt; 1. 安装 [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] 5.2.0 或更高版本。
&gt; 1. 在浏览器的 “扩展程序” 管理中开启 “开发者模式”。

## 词库本地调试方法

1. 安装用户脚本管理器 [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey]。
1. 在浏览器扩展管理中，开启 [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] 的 “允许访问文件网址”。
1. 将修改的词库文件放到方便访问的本地位置。
1. 安装 [GitHub 中文化插件 - GitHub 托管【开发版】][main.user.js] 或 [GitHub 中文化插件 - GreasyFork 托管【发布版】][main(greasyfork).user.js]。
1. 回到脚本管理器，修改词库文件路径，如将 `// @require      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maboloshi/github-chinese/gh-pages/locals.js?v1.9.0` 改为本地路径格式如 `file:///D:/APP/github%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE/github-chinese/locals.js`。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 直接将词库文件拖到浏览器的地址栏，再复制地址栏的中地址即可。

### 2021-10-07 13:16:16

原作者[楼教主](https://github.com/52cik/github-hans)已停止维护多年，且近年来 GitHub 页面结构的变化，导致原有的脚本无法正常工作。

虽然 GitHub 在被微软售收购比较重视国际化，启动并基本完成了GitHub 文档的中文化。但是，关于 GitHub 页面的中文化暂时还没启动。

对于，新手使用和高阶使用仍会存在一定的障碍。故，本人依据个人兴趣暂时进行了一定的修复和维护。

本次维护基本恢复和保留大部分功能如：页面正则翻译（含日期的正则）。页面词条可能被我切得太碎不方便后期维护（先这样吧！）

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

&lt;/div&gt;

## ✔ 待办 (TODO)

1. 添加 GitHub 名词解释，新手可能不太理解部分名词具体表达的意思，比如 `pull request`。
1. 整理部分 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) &amp; [GitHub](https://github.com/) 学习资料, 帮助新手**更快**上手。
1. **本人英文渣渣，翻译非常困难，急需大家 PR 共同翻译**

## ✨ 贡献

查看我们的[贡献小技巧](https://github.com/maboloshi/github-chinese/issues/52)

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The science of accelerated playback

**TL;DR: faster playback translates to better engagement and retention.**

The average adult reads prose text at
[250 to 300 words per minute](http://www.paperbecause.com/PIOP/files/f7/f7bb6bc5-2c4a-466f-9ae7-b483a2c0dca4.pdf)
(wpm). By contrast, the average rate of speech for English speakers is ~150 wpm,
with slide presentations often closer to 100 wpm. As a result, when given the
choice, many viewers
[speed up video playback to ~1.3\~1.5 its recorded rate](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/coet/compression/chi99/paper.pdf)
to compensate for the difference.

Many viewers report that
[accelerated viewing keeps their attention longer](http://www.enounce.com/docs/BYUPaper020319.pdf):
faster delivery keeps the viewer more engaged with the content. In fact, with a
little training many end up watching videos at 2x+ the recorded speed. Some
studies report that after being exposed to accelerated playback,
[listeners become uncomfortable](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~barons/html/avios92.html#beasleyalteredspeech)
if they are forced to return to normal rate of presentation.

## Faster HTML5 Video

HTML5 video provides a native API to accelerate playback of any video. The
problem is many players either hide or limit this functionality. For the best
results, playback speed adjustments should be easy and frequent to match the pace
and content being covered: we don&#039;t read at a fixed speed, and similarly, we
need an easy way to accelerate the video, slow it down, and quickly rewind the
last point to listen to it a few more times.

![Player](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2400185/24076745/5723e6ae-0c41-11e7-820c-1d8e814a2888.png)

### _[Install Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk)_

\*\* Once the extension is installed simply navigate to any page that offers
HTML5 video ([example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9FxNzv1Tr8)), and you&#039;ll
see a speed indicator in top left corner. Hover over the indicator to reveal the
controls to accelerate, slowdown, and quickly rewind or advance the video. Or,
even better, simply use your keyboard:

- **S** - decrease playback speed.
- **D** - increase playback speed.
- **R** - reset playback speed to 1.0x.
- **Z** - rewind video by 10 seconds.
- **X** - advance video by 10 seconds.
- **G** - toggle between current and user configurable preferred speed.
- **V** - show/hide the controller.

You can customize and reassign the default shortcut keys in the extensions
settings page as well as add additional shortcut keys to match your
preferences. As an example, you can assign multiple &quot;preferred speed&quot; shortcuts with different values, allowing you to quickly toggle between your most frequently used speeds. To add a new shortcut, open extension settings
and click &quot;Add New&quot;.
After making changes or adding new settings, remember to refresh the video viewing page for them to take effect.

![settings Add New shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121805/50726471-50242200-1172-11e9-902f-0e5958387617.jpg)

Unfortunately, some sites may assign other functionality to one of the shortcut keys - this is inevitable. As a workaround, the extension
listens both for lower and upper case values (i.e. you can use
`Shift-&lt;shortcut&gt;`) if there is other functionality assigned to the lowercase
key. This is not a perfect solution since some sites may listen to both, but it works
most of the time.

### FAQ

**The video controls are not showing up?** This extension is only compatible
with HTML5 video. If you don&#039;t see the controls showing up, chances are you are
viewing a Flash video. If you want to confirm, try right-clicking on the video
and inspect the menu: if it mentions flash, then that&#039;s the issue. That said,
most sites will fallback to HTML5 if they detect that Flash it not available.
You can try manually disabling Flash plugin in Chrome:

- In a new tab, navigate to `chrome://settings/content/flash`
- Disable &quot;Allow sites to run Flash&quot;
- Restart your browser and try playing your video again

**The speed controls are not showing up for local videos?** To enable playback
of local media (e.g. File &gt; Open File), you need to grant additional permissions
to the extension.

- In a new tab, navigate to `chrome://extensions`
- Find &quot;Video Speed Controller&quot; extension in the list and enable &quot;Allow access
  to file URLs&quot;
- Open a new tab and try opening a local file; the controls should show up.

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

&gt;
&gt; Create React App was one of the key tools for getting a React project up-and-running in 2017-2021, it is now in long-term stasis and we recommend that you migrate to one of React frameworks documented on [Start a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project).
&gt;
&gt; If you are following a tutorial to learn React, there is still value in continuing your tutorial, but we do not recommend starting production apps based on Create React App.

## Quick Overview

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

If you&#039;ve previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.&lt;br&gt;
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

&lt;p align=&#039;center&#039;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#039;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/facebook/create-react-app@27b42ac7efa018f2541153ab30d63180f5fa39e0/screencast.svg&#039; width=&#039;600&#039; alt=&#039;npm start&#039;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.&lt;br&gt;
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Creating an App

**You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

### npm

```sh
npm init react-app my-app
```

_`npm init &lt;initializer&gt;` is available in npm 6+_

### Yarn

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
```

_[`yarn create &lt;starter-kit-package&gt;`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) is available in Yarn 0.25+_

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.&lt;br&gt;
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
    └── setupTests.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.&lt;br&gt;
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.&lt;br&gt;
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.&lt;br&gt;
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

&lt;/p&gt;

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.&lt;br&gt;
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.&lt;br&gt;
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.&lt;br&gt;

Your app is ready to be deployed.

## User Guide

You can find detailed instructions on using Create React App and many tips in [its documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/).

## How to Update to New Versions?

Please refer to the [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/updating-to-new-releases) for this and other information.

## Philosophy

- **One Dependency:** There is only one build dependency. It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

- **No Configuration Required:** You don&#039;t need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

- **No Lock-In:** You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## What’s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

- React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
- An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria. (_Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher_)
- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

Check out [this guide](https://github.com/nitishdayal/cra_closer_look) for an overview of how these tools fit together.

The tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can [&quot;eject&quot;](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject) and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.

## Popular Alternatives

Create React App is a great fit for:

- **Learning React** in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.
- **Starting new single-page React applications.**
- **Creating examples** with React for your libraries and components.

Here are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:

- If you want to **try React** without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider [using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#try-react).

- If you need to **integrate React code with a server-side template framework** like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you’re **not building a single-page app**, consider using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb), or [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use [Rails Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker). For Symfony, try [Symfony&#039;s webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html).

- If you need to **publish a React component**, [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) can [also do this](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries), as well as [Neutrino&#039;s react-components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/).

- If you want to do **server rendering** with React and Node.js, check out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle). Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and only produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.

- If your website is **mostly static** (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Unlike Create React App, Gatsby pre-renders the website into HTML at build time. Next.js supports both server rendering and pre-rendering.

- Finally, if you need **more customization**, check out [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) and its [React preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react/).

All of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.

If you prefer configuring the build yourself, [follow this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html).

            <h2>README</h2><pre>Leaflet was created 14 years ago by [Volodymyr Agafonkin](https://agafonkin.com), a Ukrainian citizen living in Kyiv.

Russian bombs are now falling over Volodymyr&#039;s hometown. His family, his friends, his neighbours, thousands and thousands of absolutely wonderful people, are either seeking refuge or fighting for their lives.

Russian soldiers have already killed tens of thousands of civilians, including women and children, and are committing mass war crimes like gang rapes, executions, looting, and targeted bombings of civilian shelters and places of cultural significance. The death toll keeps rising, and Ukraine needs your help.

As Volodymyr [expressed a few days before the invasion](https://twitter.com/LeafletJS/status/1496051256409919489):

&gt; If you want to help, educate yourself and others on the Russian threat, follow reputable journalists, demand severe Russian sanctions and Ukrainian support from your leaders, protest the war, reach out to Ukrainian friends, donate to Ukrainian charities. Just don&#039;t be silent.

Ukrainians recommend the [Come Back Alive](https://savelife.in.ua/en/) charity. For other options, see [StandWithUkraine](https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua).

If an appeal to humanity doesn&#039;t work for you, I&#039;ll appeal to your egoism: the future of Ukrainian citizens is the future of Leaflet.

It is chilling to see Leaflet being used for [documenting Russia&#039;s war crimes](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/), [factual reporting of the war](https://liveuamap.com/) and for coordination of humanitarian efforts across Europe. We commend these uses of Leaflet.

If you support the actions of the Russian government (even after reading all this), do everyone else a favour and [carry some seeds in your pocket](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/feb/25/ukrainian-woman-sunflower-seeds-russian-soldiers-video).

Yours truly,&lt;br&gt;
Leaflet maintainers.

Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for **building powerful interactive maps**.

Weighing just about 42 KB of gzipped JS plus 4 KB of gzipped CSS code, it has all the mapping [features][] most developers ever need.

Leaflet is designed with *simplicity*, *performance* and *usability* in mind.
It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box,
taking advantage of modern browser features while being accessible on older ones too.
It can be extended with a huge amount of [plugins][],
has a beautiful, easy to use and [well-documented][] API
and a simple, readable [source code][] that is a joy to [contribute][] to.

For more info, docs and tutorials, check out the [official website][].&lt;br&gt;

We&#039;re happy to meet new contributors.
If you want to **get involved** with Leaflet development, check out the [contribution guide][contribute].
Let&#039;s make the best mapping library that will ever exist,
and push the limits of what&#039;s possible with online maps!

An efficient server implies a lower cost of the infrastructure, better
responsiveness under load, and happy users. How can you efficiently handle the
resources of your server, knowing that you are serving the highest number of
requests possible, without sacrificing security validations and handy
development?

Enter Fastify. Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best
developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.
It is inspired by Hapi and Express and as far as we know, it is one of the
fastest web frameworks in town.

The `main` branch refers to the Fastify `v5` release.
Check out the [`4.x` branch](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/tree/4.x) for `v4`.

### Quick start

Create a folder and make it your current working directory:

```sh
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
```

Generate a fastify project with `npm init`:

```sh
npm init fastify
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

To start the app in dev mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

For production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Under the hood `npm init` downloads and runs [Fastify
Create](https://github.com/fastify/create-fastify), which in turn uses the
generate functionality of [Fastify CLI](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cli).


### Install

To install Fastify in an existing project as a dependency:

```sh
npm i fastify
```

### Example

```js
// Require the framework and instantiate it

// ESM
import Fastify from &#039;fastify&#039;

const fastify = Fastify({
  logger: true
})
// CommonJs
const fastify = require(&#039;fastify&#039;)({
  logger: true
})

// Declare a route
fastify.get(&#039;/&#039;, (request, reply) =&gt; {
  reply.send({ hello: &#039;world&#039; })
})

// Run the server!
fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err
  // Server is now listening on ${address}
})
```

With async-await:

```js
// ESM
import Fastify from &#039;fastify&#039;

const fastify = Fastify({
  logger: true
})
// CommonJs
const fastify = require(&#039;fastify&#039;)({
  logger: true
})

fastify.get(&#039;/&#039;, async (request, reply) =&gt; {
  reply.type(&#039;application/json&#039;).code(200)
  return { hello: &#039;world&#039; }
})

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err
  // Server is now listening on ${address}
})
```

Do you want to know more? Head to the &lt;a
href=&quot;./docs/Guides/Getting-Started.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
If you learn best by reading code, explore the official [demo](https://github.com/fastify/demo).

&gt; ## Note
&gt; `.listen` binds to the local host, `localhost`, interface by default
&gt; (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`, depending on the operating system configuration). If
&gt; you are running Fastify in a container (Docker,
&gt; [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), etc.), you may need to bind to `0.0.0.0`. Be
&gt; careful when listening on all interfaces; it comes with inherent
&gt; [security
&gt; risks](https://web.archive.org/web/20170711105010/https://snyk.io/blog/mongodb-hack-and-secure-defaults/).
&gt; See [the documentation](./docs/Reference/Server.md#listen) for more
&gt; information.

### Core features

- **Highly performant:** as far as we know, Fastify is one of the fastest web
  frameworks in town, depending on the code complexity we can serve up to 76+
  thousand requests per second.
- **Extensible:** Fastify is fully extensible via its hooks, plugins, and
  decorators.
- **Schema-based:** even if it is not mandatory we recommend using [JSON
  Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to validate your routes and serialize your
  outputs. Internally Fastify compiles the schema in a highly performant
  function.
- **Logging:** logs are extremely important but are costly; we chose the best
  logger to almost remove this cost, [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)!
- **Developer friendly:** the framework is built to be very expressive and help
  developers in their daily use without sacrificing performance and
  security.

These benchmarks taken using https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks. This is a
synthetic &quot;hello world&quot; benchmark that aims to evaluate the framework overhead.
The overhead that each framework has on your application depends on your
application. You should __always__ benchmark if performance matters to you.

&lt;hr&gt;

Meteor is an **ultra-simple** environment for building **modern** web applications.

&lt;hr&gt;

- [Official Website](https://www.meteor.com)
- [Installation](https://www.meteor.com/developers/install)
- [Documentation](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/)

&lt;hr&gt;

### 📚 **Create your applications using modern JavaScript**

Benefit from the latest technology updates to rapidly prototype and develop your applications.

&lt;hr&gt;

### ✨ **Integrate technologies you already use**

Use popular frameworks and tools right out-of-the-box. Focus on building features instead of configuring disparate components yourself.

&lt;hr&gt;

### 💻 **Build apps for any device**

Use the same code whether you’re developing for web, iOS, Android, or desktop for a seamless update experience for your users.

&lt;hr&gt;

## 简介

• 支持将 QX 重写解析至 Surge Shadowrocket Loon Stash

• 支持将 Surge 模块解析至 Loon Stash

• 支持将 Loon 插件解析至 Surge Shadowrocket Stash

• 支持 QX &amp; Surge &amp; Loon &amp; Shadowrocket &amp; Clash 规则集解析，适用 app: Surge Shadowrocket Stash Loon

• 支持 将 QX 脚本转换成 Surge 脚本(兼容)

• 可以修改参数 argument

• 支持一键导入 Shadowrocket / Loon / Stash

• 高级功能 OR 修改任意文本

• 如果某些模块需要 `加参数才能使用` 但只想用远程链接，不想拉取到本地模块的情况 可以直接使用 `纯文本` -&gt; `高级操作`、`修改参数` 功能修改远程链接 `任意内容` 或者 `argument` 参数, 不用再复制到本地模块

• [🆕 不需要代理 app 的全服务器部署版(测试中)](&lt;https://github.com/Script-Hub-Org/Script-Hub/wiki/%E5%85%A8%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8%E7%89%88(%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%E4%B8%AD)&gt;)

• 相关生态: [Surge 模块工具](https://github.com/Script-Hub-Org/Script-Hub/wiki/%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3%E7%94%9F%E6%80%81:-Surge-%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7) 支持一键导入 Surge， 需要下载「Scriptable」app. 如果想把其他非 Script Hub 转换的 模块放在本地, 也可单独用此脚本
