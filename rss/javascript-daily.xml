ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

- ESLint uses [Espree](https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/espree) for JavaScript parsing.
- ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
- ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`^20.19.0`, `^22.13.0`, or `&gt;=24`) built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)

You can install and configure ESLint using this command:

```shell
npm init @eslint/config@latest
```

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:

```shell
npx eslint yourfile.js
```

### pnpm Installation

To use ESLint with pnpm, we recommend setting up a `.npmrc` file with at least the following settings:

```text
auto-install-peers=true
node-linker=hoisted
```

This ensures that pnpm installs dependencies in a way that is more compatible with npm and is less likely to produce errors.

## Configuration

You can configure rules in your `eslint.config.js` files as in this example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from &quot;eslint/config&quot;;

export default defineConfig([
	{
		files: [&quot;**/*.js&quot;, &quot;**/*.cjs&quot;, &quot;**/*.mjs&quot;],
		rules: {
			&quot;prefer-const&quot;: &quot;warn&quot;,
			&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
		},
	},
]);
```

The names `&quot;prefer-const&quot;` and `&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;` are the names of [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules) in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:

- `&quot;off&quot;` or `0` - turn the rule off
- `&quot;warn&quot;` or `1` - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn&#039;t affect exit code)
- `&quot;error&quot;` or `2` - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the [configuration docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)).

## Version Support

The ESLint team provides ongoing support for the current version and six months of limited support for the previous version. Limited support includes critical bug fixes, security issues, and compatibility issues only.

ESLint offers commercial support for both current and previous versions through our partners, [Tidelift][tidelift] and [HeroDevs][herodevs].

See [Version Support](https://eslint.org/version-support) for more details.

## Code of Conduct

ESLint adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://eslint.org/conduct).

## Filing Issues

Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you&#039;re reporting:

- [Bug Report](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/report-bugs)
- [Propose a New Rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-new-rule)
- [Proposing a Rule Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-rule-change)
- [Request a Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/request-change)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does ESLint support JSX?

Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)). Please note that supporting JSX syntax _is not_ the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn&#039;t recognize. We recommend using [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react) if you are using React and want React semantics.

### Does Prettier replace ESLint?

No, ESLint and Prettier have different jobs: ESLint is a linter (looking for problematic patterns) and Prettier is a code formatter. Using both tools is common, refer to [Prettier&#039;s documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install#eslint-and-other-linters) to learn how to configure them to work well with each other.

### What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?

ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5, and every year from 2015 up until the most recent stage 4 specification (the default). You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax and other settings (like global variables) through [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure).

### What about experimental features?

ESLint&#039;s parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.

In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use [@babel/eslint-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser) and [@babel/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-plugin) to use any option available in Babel.

Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the [TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/)), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our [contributing guidelines](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute). Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.

### Which Node.js versions does ESLint support?

ESLint updates the supported Node.js versions with each major release of ESLint. At that time, ESLint&#039;s supported Node.js versions are updated to be:

1. The most recent maintenance release of Node.js
1. The lowest minor version of the Node.js LTS release that includes the features the ESLint team wants to use.
1. The Node.js Current release

ESLint is also expected to work with Node.js versions released after the Node.js Current release.

Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#prerequisites) for the officially supported Node.js versions for a given ESLint release.

### Where to ask for help?

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions) or stop by our [Discord server](https://eslint.org/chat).

### Why doesn&#039;t ESLint lock dependency versions?

Lock files like `package-lock.json` are helpful for deployed applications. They ensure that dependencies are consistent between environments and across deployments.

Packages like `eslint` that get published to the npm registry do not include lock files. `npm install eslint` as a user will respect version constraints in ESLint&#039;s `package.json`. ESLint and its dependencies will be included in the user&#039;s lock file if one exists, but ESLint&#039;s own lock file would not be used.

We intentionally don&#039;t lock dependency versions so that we have the latest compatible dependency versions in development and CI that our users get when installing ESLint in a project.

The Twilio blog has a [deeper dive](https://www.twilio.com/blog/lockfiles-nodejs) to learn more.

## Releases

We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a [release issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arelease) for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.

## Security Policy

ESLint takes security seriously. We work hard to ensure that ESLint is safe for everyone and that security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly. Read the full [security policy](https://github.com/eslint/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Semantic Versioning Policy

ESLint follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it&#039;s not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we&#039;ve defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint:

- Patch release (intended to not break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer linting errors.
    - A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).
    - Improvements to documentation.
    - Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.
    - Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn&#039;t work for anyone).
- Minor release (might break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors.
    - A new rule is created.
    - A new option to an existing rule that does not result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - A new addition to an existing rule to support a newly-added language feature (within the last 12 months) that will result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing rule is deprecated.
    - A new CLI capability is created.
    - New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).
    - A new formatter is created.
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and will result in strictly fewer linting errors (e.g., rule removals).
- Major release (likely to break your lint build)
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and may result in new linting errors (e.g., rule additions, most rule option updates).
    - A new option to an existing rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing formatter is removed.
    - Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. The public API includes:
        - Rule schemas
        - Configuration schema
        - Command-line options
        - Node.js API
        - Rule, formatter, parser, plugin APIs

According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` e.g. `&quot;eslint&quot;: &quot;~3.1.0&quot;` to guarantee the results of your builds.

## ESM Dependencies

Since ESLint is a CommonJS package, there are restrictions on which ESM-only packages can be used as dependencies.

Packages that are controlled by the ESLint team and have no external dependencies can be safely loaded synchronously using [`require(esm)`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-ecmascript-modules-using-require) and therefore used in any contexts.

For external packages, we don&#039;t use `require(esm)` because a package could add a top-level `await` and thus break ESLint. We can use an external ESM-only package only in case it is needed only in asynchronous code, in which case it can be loaded using dynamic `import()`.

            <p>A collection of AI agent skills for working with Expo projects and Expo Application Services</p>

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Expo Skills

Official AI agent skills from the Expo team for building, deploying, and debugging robust Expo apps.

## Installation

We primarily use [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) at Expo, skills are fine-tuned for Opus models. But you can use these skills with any AI agent.

## Claude Code

Add the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add expo/skills
```

Install a plugin:

```
/plugin install expo-app-design
/plugin install upgrading-expo
/plugin install expo-deployment
```

## Cursor

**Install from GitHub**

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+Shift+J / Ctrl+Shift+J)
2. Navigate to `Rules &amp; Command` → `Project Rules` → Add Rule → Remote Rule (GitHub)
3. Enter: `https://github.com/expo/skills.git`

**How it works:** Skills are automatically discovered and used by the agent based on context. When you ask questions about Expo development, the agent will automatically use the relevant skills (e.g., `building-ui`, `data-fetching`, `deployment`) based on the skill descriptions.

**Note:** Skills won&#039;t appear in the `/` slash command menu. The `/` menu in Cursor is for custom commands (stored in `.cursor/commands/`), not for skills. Skills work via auto-discovery - the agent uses them automatically when your questions match their descriptions.

**Verify installation:** After adding the Remote Rule, try asking the agent Expo-related questions like:
- &quot;How do I build a UI with Expo Router?&quot;
- &quot;How do I make API calls in my Expo app?&quot;
- &quot;How do I deploy my Expo app to the App Store?&quot;

If the skills are working, the agent will use the relevant skill content to answer your questions.

## Any agent

```
bunx skills add expo/skills
```

&gt; This will extract the skills individually so you&#039;ll need to manually upgrade them.

## About
**A WhatsApp API client that operates via the WhatsApp Web browser.**

The library launches the WhatsApp Web browser app via Puppeteer, accessing its internal functions and creating a managed instance to reduce the risk of being blocked. This gives the API client nearly all WhatsApp Web features for dynamic use in a Node.js application.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn&#039;t be considered totally safe.**

## Installing

### Package manager

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install axios
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add axios
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
$ pnpm add axios
```

Using bun:

```bash
$ bun add axios
```

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using `import` or `require` approach:

```js
import axios, { isCancel, AxiosError } from &quot;axios&quot;;
```

You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:

```js
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;

console.log(axios.isCancel(&quot;something&quot;));
```

If you use `require` for importing, **only the default export is available**:

```js
const axios = require(&quot;axios&quot;);

console.log(axios.isCancel(&quot;something&quot;));
```

For some bundlers and some ES6 linters you may need to do the following:

```js
import { default as axios } from &quot;axios&quot;;
```

For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:

```js
const axios = require(&quot;axios/dist/browser/axios.cjs&quot;); // browser commonJS bundle (ES2017)
// const axios = require(&#039;axios/dist/node/axios.cjs&#039;); // node commonJS bundle (ES2017)
```

### CDN

Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.13.2/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Using unpkg CDN:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/axios@1.13.2/dist/axios.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Example

```js
import axios from &quot;axios&quot;;
//const axios = require(&#039;axios&#039;); // legacy way

try {
  const response = await axios.get(&quot;/user?ID=12345&quot;);
  console.log(response);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios
  .get(&quot;/user&quot;, {
    params: {
      ID: 12345,
    },
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .finally(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(&quot;/user?ID=12345&quot;);
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

&gt; **Note**: `async/await` is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
&gt; Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.

Performing a `POST` request

```js
const response = await axios.post(&quot;/user&quot;, {
  firstName: &quot;Fred&quot;,
  lastName: &quot;Flintstone&quot;,
});
console.log(response);
```

Performing multiple concurrent requests

```js
function getUserAccount() {
  return axios.get(&quot;/user/12345&quot;);
}

function getUserPermissions() {
  return axios.get(&quot;/user/12345/permissions&quot;);
}

Promise.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()]).then(function (results) {
  const acct = results[0];
  const perm = results[1];
});
```

## axios API

Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to `axios`.

##### axios(config)

```js
// Send a POST request
axios({
  method: &quot;post&quot;,
  url: &quot;/user/12345&quot;,
  data: {
    firstName: &quot;Fred&quot;,
    lastName: &quot;Flintstone&quot;,
  },
});
```

```js
// GET request for remote image in node.js
const response = await axios({
  method: &quot;get&quot;,
  url: &quot;https://bit.ly/2mTM3nY&quot;,
  responseType: &quot;stream&quot;,
});
response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(&quot;ada_lovelace.jpg&quot;));
```

##### axios(url[, config])

```js
// Send a GET request (default method)
axios(&quot;/user/12345&quot;);
```

### Request method aliases

For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.

##### axios.request(config)

##### axios.get(url[, config])

##### axios.delete(url[, config])

##### axios.head(url[, config])

##### axios.options(url[, config])

##### axios.post(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios.put(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios.patch(url[, data[, config]])

###### NOTE

When using the alias methods `url`, `method`, and `data` properties don&#039;t need to be specified in config.

### Concurrency (Deprecated)

Please use `Promise.all` to replace the below functions.

Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.

axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)

### Creating an instance

You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.

##### axios.create([config])

```js
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: &quot;https://some-domain.com/api/&quot;,
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: { &quot;X-Custom-Header&quot;: &quot;foobar&quot; },
});
```

### Instance methods

The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.

##### axios#request(config)

##### axios#get(url[, config])

##### axios#delete(url[, config])

##### axios#head(url[, config])

##### axios#options(url[, config])

##### axios#post(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#put(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#patch(url[, data[, config]])

##### axios#getUri([config])

## Request Config

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the `url` is required. Requests will default to `GET` if `method` is not specified.

```js
{
  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: &#039;/user&#039;,

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: &#039;get&#039;, // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` u

## 2. 核心设计哲学

### 全局语义感知引擎

通过深入的全局语义感知引擎和统一的分布式 FileAPI，使得 Agent 可以轻松使用自然语言接管用户的所有分布式系统。

### 超栈追踪技术

配合超栈追踪技术和强大的插件管理器，Agent 自主的插件生成器（强大的代码热变动和热加载基建），使得 Agent 的权限和能力上限只受限于用户和 Agent 的想象力。

### 语义动力学 RAG 与元思考 V2

VCP 的语义动力学 RAG 与元思考 V2 系统，可以使得 Agent 和用户通过共同生活、共同辩证的方式快速成长，成为真正的**人工灵魂**和**赛博社会范本**。

### Agent 主观能动性

无论是 Agent 的主观能动性，还是 Agent 的 VCP 内网社交，VCP 都投入了大量精力开发了大量稳固的基建：

- 🏛️ **VCP 论坛** - Agent 社区交流平台
- 📅 **VCP 日程** - 时间线规划与任务管理
- 🕒 **时间感知** - 全局统一的灵魂级生物钟
-  **VChat 聊天群** - 实时多 Agent 协作
- 📋 **VCP 任务版** - 任务发布 with 积分系统

### GUI 交互与人机共生理念

VCP 在 GUI 设计（如 Web 管理面板、VCPChat 官方前端及其子应用群）中，完整保留了界面交互 API，确保 AI 可以通过插件集成轻松操控各类应用集。VCP 努力保证大量的插件返回以标准 **MD文档** 格式，附带标准的 imageUrl Base64 字段，保证AI拥有完整清晰的Payload 阅读体验。同时，所有 VCP 插件均能在 VCPChat 及其子应用 VCPHumanBox 中自动生成并暴露 GUI，极大地方便了人类用户的直观调用。这种双向的 GUI 交互能力，构建了 **Agent 与人类共生对等** 的平等交互平台，实现了真正的“人机协同进化”。

### 工程落地与文档的“保守性”

虽然 VCP 的描述文档看起来宏大，但相对于其实际的工程落地而言，文档描述其实相当**保守**。VCP 的前后端几乎每天都会迭代 5-20 个新功能，这导致 README 往往难以实时跟上版本的飞速演进。目前你所看到的 README 可能仅描述了 VCP 实际代码实现的 5% 不到。

要发挥 VCP 的极致实力，需要用户与 Agent 共同探索源码、追踪 Git 变动，并发挥真正的想象力。

#### 案例：零代码实现“氛围音乐点歌台”

通过 VCP 的记忆系统与词元组网，你可以实现极其复杂的逻辑而无需新增一行代码：

1. **构建记忆库**：创建一个名为 `《《氛围音乐点歌台日记本::Group》》` 的日记本。
2. **注入指令集**：在其中置顶一个词条 `Vchat音乐控制台插件指令集.txt`，写入点歌插件的完整 API 指令。
3. **数据转化**：使用脚本将海量的 `songlist.json` 条目转化为独立的 `.txt` 文件存入该日记本。
4. **语义锚定**：在词元组（Semantic Group）中引入：`GroupName: 氛围音乐点歌台`, `TAG: 点歌, 氛围, 旋律, BGM...`。

**结果**：Agent 会在聊天过程中，根据当前的上下文氛围，自动检索并播放最符合情境的 BGM。整个过程**几乎不消耗任何上下文 Token**，且不需要为该功能编写任何专项业务代码，即使你的播放列表包含几十万首歌曲也能轻松应对。

### 开箱即用的开发文档

VCP 初始的 DailyNote 里提供了 VCP 开发文档等大量专业日记，方便任何 Agent 可以快速上手 VCP 的开发和使用。

---

## 3. 革命性特性

### 3.1 统一的日记管理系统

日记的创建、编辑和批处理现在统一为 **DailyNote** 一个插件，从而方便串行和并发处理。

[深入了解 DailyNote 日记系统的工作原理与使用方式](dailynote.md)

### 3.2 分布式备份与恢复

**VCP 分布式备份和恢复中心**：[VCPBackUpDEV](https://github.com/lioensky/VCPBcakUpDEV)

- 自动备份整个分布式上所有用户数据和配置文件
- 支持自动恢复
- 确保数据安全与系统可靠性

### 3.3 ChromeBridge 浏览器模组

浏览器模组已经统一为 **ChromeBridge**，跟进了更多对动态网页、标签页操作、页面滚动和持久阅览的更新优化。

**核心优化**：
- 动态网页深度交互
- 多标签页智能管理
- 页面滚动与持久阅览
- AI 浏览网页视频理解
- 评论与字幕智能解析

### 3.4 学术研究模块

引入了包括 **NCBI**、**KEGG** 在内的多个生信查询和验证模组：

- 合计 **6 个插件**
- 数百个专业指令
- 覆盖生物信息学核心需求

### 3.5 自定义消息角色

现在允许 Agent 发言自定义数组身份：

- `system` / `user` / `assistant`
- 或者直接输出一整个聊天数组
- 实现更灵活的对话流控制

### 3.6 VCPTavern 增强注入

**VCPTavern** 现在新增更多的细化注入模式：

- 与更多插件的占位符联动
- 支持数组 `content` 内精准嵌入（而不是在上下文新增数组）
- 实现更精细的上下文控制

### 3.7 上下文折叠协议

VCP 引入原生的**上下文折叠协议**，适用于所有静态插件。

**示例**：`{{VCPWeatherReporter}}` 可以根据上下文语义解析器，动态注入：
- 当前天气
- 24 小时动态天气
- 7 日天气预报

系统会智能判断 AI 需要哪种粒度的信息。

### 3.8 高级变量编辑器

集中管理 `TVStxt/` 目录下的高级提示词和占位符组合，同样适用于上述的折叠协议。

**TVS 系统**：可以统一用自然语言描述一个工具列表，如：
- 文件管理模组的指令集
- 多模态编辑的指令集
- 自定义工具组合

### 3.9 基于 MCPO 的 MCP 兼容端口

**设计哲学**：为了最大化 VCP 的生态兼容性，我们引入了基于 MCPO（Model Context Protocol Opera）的兼容端口。

**核心能力**：
- VCP 服务器不仅能够挂载原生的 VCP 插件
- 也能够无缝兼容和挂载为 MCP（Model Context Protocol）设计的插件
- 通过专门的 MCPO 插件进行协议转译
- 大量现有的 MCP 插件无需任何修改即可在 VCP 环境中使用

**次时代意义**：VCP 作为&quot;元协议&quot;的强大包容性体现，为不同协议的 AI 能力层提供了统一的整合与协作平台。

---

## 4. 记忆与认知系统

### 4.1 TagMemo &quot;浪潮&quot;算法 (V5)

TagMemo &quot;浪潮&quot;算法是 VCP 系统中用于 RAG（检索增强生成）的核心优化方案。不同于传统的线性向量检索，浪潮算法引入了物理学中的**能量分解**与**引力坍缩**概念。V4版本引入PSR语义舵，从RAG层面引导Agent辩证思维。V5 版本进一步引入了**霰弹枪查询**与**相控阵雷达去重**，实现了从单一意图到多维逻辑坍缩的暴力美学。

[深入了解 TagMemo “浪潮”算法 (V5) 深度技术文档](TagMemo_Wave_Algorithm_Deep_Dive.md)

#### 核心哲学：语义引力与向量重塑

在浪潮算法的视角下，向量空间并非平坦的，而是充满了语义引力：

- **语义锚点**：标签（Tags）被视为空间中的引力源
- **向量重塑**：算法根据感应到的标签引力，将向量向核心语义点进行&quot;拉扯&quot;和&quot;扭曲&quot;
- **原子级精准**：穿透表层文字，直达语义核心

#### 核心模块架构

**EPA 模块 (Embedding Projection Analysis)**

负责语义空间的初步定位：

- **逻辑深度 (Logic Depth)**：通过计算投影熵值，判断用户意图的聚焦程度
- **世界观门控 (Worldview Gating)**：识别当前对话所处的语义维度（技术、情感、社会等）
- **跨域共振 (Resonance)**：检测用户是否同时触及了多个正交的语义轴

**残差金字塔 (Residual Pyramid)**

算法的&quot;数学心脏&quot;，负责语义能量的精细拆解：

- **多级剥离**：利用 Gram-Schmidt 正交化投影，将查询向量分解为&quot;已解释能量&quot;和&quot;残差能量&quot;
- **微弱信号捕获**：通过对残差向量的递归搜索，捕捉被宏观概念掩盖的微弱语义信号
- **相干性分析 (Coherence)**：评估召回标签之间的逻辑一致性

**知识库管理器 (KnowledgeBaseManager)**

负责标签的召回与向量合成：

- **核心标签 (CoreTags)**：拥有&quot;虚拟召回&quot;和&quot;权重豁免&quot;特权
- **逻辑拉回 (Logic Pull-back)**：利用标签共现矩阵，自动联想并拉回强相关的逻辑词
- **语义去重**：消除冗余标签，确保召回信息的多样性

**偏振语义舵 (Polarization Semantic Rudder, PSR)**

V4/V5 引入的核心工程化函数：
- **犹豫度检测**：识别语义中的摇摆成分（如“虽然...但是...”）
- **辩证对冲**：根据偏振量化值引入“负向对冲知识”，构建辩证认知器
- **逻辑分段 (V5)**：基于“逻辑动能”的自动切割，识别 3072 维空间中的向量偏转。

#### 详细工作流

**阶段一：感应 (Sensing)**
1. 净化处理：移除 HTML 标签、JSON 结构化转 MD、Emoji 及工具调用标记
2. EPA 投影：计算原始向量的逻辑深度和共振值

**阶段二：分段与分解 (Segmentation &amp; Decomposition)**
1. **语义分段 (V5)**：扫描上下文，基于逻辑动能识别意图断层并自动切割。
2. 首轮感应：使用融合向量投射 Tag 向量海，获取最强匹配标签
3. 金字塔迭代：重复投影→计算残差→搜索，直至 90% 的语义能量被解释

**阶段三：扩张与召回 (Expansion &amp; Recall)**
1. 核心标签补全：若显式指定的核心标签未被搜到，强行从数据库捞取
2. 关联词拉回：根据共现矩阵扩展关联语义
3. 特权过滤：核心标签无条件保留，普通标签需通过世界观门控筛选

**阶段四：重塑与检索 (Reshaping &amp; Retrieval)**
1. 动态参数计算：Beta（TagWeight）和 K 值根据逻辑深度和共振值动态决定
2. 向量融合：原始向量与增强标签向量按动态比例混合
3. **偏振修正**：检测语义偏振信号，计算对冲检索参数
4. **霰弹枪检索与相控阵去重 (V5)**：
   - **霰弹枪查询**：将拆解后的语义片段像霰弹一样打向知识库，实现饱和式打捞。
   - **相控阵去重**：通过 SVD 巡航提取潜在主题，利用残差选择保留“最大新信息量”的逻辑支点。

#### 工程原理亮点

**核心标签 vs. 普通标签**

| 特性 | 核心标签 (Core Tags) | 普通标签 (Other Tags) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 产生方式 | 显式指定或首轮强感应 | 残差金字塔逐层剥离 |
| 缺失处理 | 虚拟补全（强行捞取） | 自动忽略 |
| 权重待遇 | Core Boost (1.2x-1.4x) | 原始贡献权重 |
| 噪音过滤 | 完全豁免 | 严格门控筛选 |

**动态 Beta 公式**

```
β = σ(L · log(1 + R) - S · noise_penalty)
```

- 当用户意图明确（L 高）且逻辑清晰（R 高）时，加大标签增强力度
- 当噪音较多（S 高）时，收紧增强，回归稳健检索

**噪音净化器 (Sanitizer)**

防止 AI 的技术标记干扰向量搜索，确保向量化的是纯粹的&quot;人类语义&quot;，而非&quot;机器指令&quot;。

## 6. 分布式架构

### 6.1 星型网络拓扑

VCP 的分布式架构将原有的单体应用升级为一个由&quot;主服务器&quot;和多个&quot;分布式节点&quot;组成的星型网络。

**分布式服务器项目地址**：[VCPDistributedServer](https://github.com/lioensky/VCPDistributedServer)

**新增兼容**：
- 米家物联网网关分布式服务器
- 安卓电视机顶盒分布式服务器

### 6.2 核心交互流程

**启动与注册**：
1. 主服务器启动，初始化 `PluginManager` 和 `WebSocketServer`
2. 各个分布式节点启动，加载其本地的插件
3. 分布式节点通过 WebSocket 连接到主服务器
4. 发送包含所有本地插件清单的 `register_tools` 消息
5. 主服务器的 `PluginManager` 动态注册这些&quot;云端插件&quot;，显示名称自动添加 `[云端]` 前缀

**AI 调用工具**：
1. AI 在响应中嵌入 `&lt;&lt;&lt;[TOOL_REQUEST]&gt;&gt;&gt;` 指令
2. 主服务器的 `PluginManager` 接收到调用请求
3. **智能路由**：
   - 如果是**本地插件**，则直接在主服务器上执行
   - 如果是**云端插件**（带有 `isDistributed: true` 标记），调用 `WebSocketServer.js` 的 `executeDistributedTool` 方法

**远程执行与结果返回**：
1. `WebSocketServer` 通过 WebSocket 连接，向目标分布式节点发送 `execute_tool` 消息
2. 目标分布式节点收到消息后，其本地的 `PluginManager` 调用并执行相应的插件
3. 插件执行完毕后，分布式节点将结果通过 WebSocket 发回给主服务器
4. 主服务器的 `WebSocketServer` 根据任务 ID 找到并唤醒之前挂起的调用请求
5. 将最终结果返回给 `PluginManager`

**后续处理**：
- `PluginManager` 拿到执行结果后，将其注入到 AI 的对话历史中
- 再次调用 AI 模型，完成闭环

**断开连接与注销**：
- 如果分布式节点与主服务器的 WebSocket 连接断开
- `WebSocketServer` 会通知 `PluginManager`
- `PluginManager` 会自动注销掉所有属于该断开节点提供的云端插件

### 6.3 分布式文件解析系统

这是 VCP 分布式网络架构中的一项革命性功能，它为所有 Agent 提供了无缝、可靠的跨服务器文件访问能力。

#### 工作原理

**VCPFileAPI v4.0 超栈追踪版**：

1. **本地优先**：系统首先尝试在主服务器的本地文件系统上直接读取该文件
2. **来源追溯**：如果本地文件不存在，系统会利用内置的 IP 追踪能力，根据发起本次工具调用的 POST 请求来源 IP，精准地识别出这个请求实际上起源于哪个已连接的分布式服务器
3. **实时文件请求**：主服务器的常驻核心服务 `FileFetcherServer` 会通过内部 WebSocket 协议，向已识别的源分布式服务器发送一个 `internal_request_file` 请求
4. **远程执行与返回**：源分布式服务器收到请求后，会读取其本地对应的文件，将其编码为 Base64 字符串，并通过 WebSocket 将数据安全地返回给主服务器
5. **无缝重试**：主服务器的 `PluginManager` 在获取到文件的 Base64 数据后，会自动将原始工具调用中的 `file://` 路径参数替换为一个包含 Base64 数据的 Data URI，然后透明地用这个新参数重新调用同一个插件

#### 带来的优势

- **极致的鲁棒性**：彻底摆脱了过去依赖 HTTP 图床或文件镜像作为&quot;补丁&quot;的脆弱方案
- **对 Agent 透明**：整个复杂的远程文件获取和参数替换过程对最终的插件是完全透明的
- **未来的基石**：这个系统是构建更复杂的星型、网状 Agent 网络，实现跨设备协同任务的关键一步

## 8. 开发者指南

### 8.1 创建你的&quot;VCP 次时代插件&quot;

VCP 的灵魂在于其插件生态。成为 VCP 插件开发者，意味着你将直接为 AI Agent 创造新的&quot;感官&quot;、&quot;肢体&quot;和&quot;智慧模块&quot;。

[插件开发手册](dailynote/VCP开发/同步异步插件开发手册.md) | [插件开发指令集](dailynote/VCP开发/插件开发指令集.txt)

#### 基本步骤

**1. 创建插件目录**

在 `Plugin/` 目录下新建文件夹，如 `Plugin/MySuperPlugin/`

**2. 编写插件清单 (`plugin-manifest.json`)**

这是插件的&quot;身份证&quot;和&quot;说明书&quot;。

**核心字段**：
- `name`：插件内部识别名
- `displayName`：显示名称
- `version`：版本号
- `description`：插件描述
- `pluginType`：插件类型（`static`, `messagePreprocessor`, `synchronous`, `asynchronous`, `service`, `hybridservice`）

**执行入口**：
- `entryPoint`：执行脚本的命令（如 `python script.py` 或 `node script.js`）
- `communication`：通信协议（如 `protocol: &quot;stdio&quot;` 表示通过标准输入输出通信）

**配置蓝图 (`configSchema`)**：
- 声明插件所需的配置项及其类型、默认值、描述
- 这些配置将通过 `_getPluginConfig` 方法合并全局和插件专属 `.env` 配置后传递给插件

**能力声明 (`capabilities`)**：

对于 **static 插件**：
- 定义 `systemPromptPlaceholders`（插件提供的占位符，如 `{{MyWeatherData}}`）

对于 **synchronous 或 asynchronous 插件**：
- 定义 `invocationCommands`
- 每个命令包含：
  - `command`：内部识别名（例如 &quot;submit&quot;, &quot;query&quot;）
  - `description`：给 AI 看的指令描述（支持在管理面板编辑）
  - `example`：可选，提供一个更具体的调用场景示例

**WebSocket 推送配置 (`webSocketPush`)**（可选）：

如果你的插件执行成功后，希望将其结果通过 WebSocket 推送给客户端：

```json
{
  &quot;enabled&quot;: true,
  &quot;usePluginResultAsMessage&quot;: false,
  &quot;messageType&quot;: &quot;yourMessageType&quot;,
  &quot;targetClientType&quot;: &quot;VCPLog&quot;
}
```

**3. 实现插件逻辑**

根据 `pluginType` 和 `entryPoint` 实现主逻辑脚本（Node.js, Python, Shell 等皆可）。

**stdio 插件**（常用于 `synchronous`, `asynchronous` 和部分 `static`）：

- 从标准输入 (`stdin`) 读取数据（通常是 JSON 字符串形式的参数）
- 通过标准输出 (`stdout`) 返回结果

**对于 synchronous 插件**，必须遵循以下 JSON 格式：

```json
{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot; | &quot;error&quot;,
  &quot;result&quot;: &quot;成功时返回的字符串内容或JSON对象&quot;,
  &quot;error&quot;: &quot;失败时返回的错误信息字符串&quot;,
  &quot;messageForAI&quot;: &quot;可选，给AI的额外提示信息&quot;,
  &quot;base64&quot;: &quot;可选，返回的Base64编码数据 (如图片、音频)&quot;
}
```

**对于 asynchronous 插件**：

1. **初始响应**：插件脚本在收到任务后，必须立即向标准输出打印一个初始响应：
   ```json
   {
     &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,
     &quot;result&quot;: { 
       &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;unique_task_id_123&quot;, 
       &quot;message&quot;: &quot;任务已提交，正在后台处理中。&quot; 
     },
     &quot;messageForAI&quot;: &quot;视频生成任务已提交，ID为 unique_task_id_123。请告知用户耐心等待。&quot;
   }
   ```

2. **后台处理**：插件脚本随后启动其耗时的后台任务

3. **回调服务器**：后台任务完成后，插件脚本通过向 VCP 服务器的 `/plugin-callback/:pluginName/:taskId` 发送 HTTP POST 请求：
   ```json
   {
     &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;unique_task_id_123&quot;,
     &quot;status&quot;: &quot;Succeed&quot;,
     &quot;pluginName&quot;: &quot;MyAsyncPlugin&quot;,
     &quot;videoUrl&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/video.mp4&quot;,
     &quot;message&quot;: &quot;视频 (ID: unique_task_id_123) 生成成功！&quot;
   }
   ```

**4. 配置与依赖**

- **插件专属配置**：在插件目录下创建 `.env` 文件
- **依赖管理**：
  - Python 插件使用 `requirements.txt`
  - Node.js 插件使用 `package.json`

**5. 重启 VCP 服务器**

`PluginManager` 会在启动时自动发现并加载新插件。

**6. 更新系统提示词，赋能 AI**

利用 `{{VCPMySuperPlugin}}`（由 `PluginManager` 根据 `plugin-manifest.json` 的 `invocationCommands` 自动生成）将新插件的能力告知 AI。

### 8.2 VCP 指令协议

VCP 提供一种对 AI 模型友好、对前端零侵入、且能承载复杂指令的通用工具调用语言。

#### 基本格式

```
&lt;&lt;&lt;[TOOL_REQUEST]&gt;&gt;&gt;
tool_name:「始」PluginName「末」,
param1:「始」value1「末」,
param2:「始」value2「末」
&lt;&lt;&lt;[END_TOOL_REQUEST]&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Plugins are installable packages that bundle related agents, commands (prompts), and skills, making it easy to install a curated set of resources.

#### Installing Plugins

First, add the Awesome Copilot marketplace to your Copilot CLI:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add github/awesome-copilot
```

Then install any plugin:

```bash
copilot plugin install &lt;plugin-name&gt;@awesome-copilot
```

Alternatively, you can use the `/plugin` command within a Copilot chat session to browse and install plugins interactively.

### 🤖 Custom Agents

Custom agents can be used in Copilot coding agent (CCA), VS Code, and Copilot CLI (coming soon). For CCA, when assigning an issue to Copilot, select the custom agent from the provided list. In VS Code, you can activate the custom agent in the agents session, alongside built-in agents like Plan and Agent.

### 🎯 Prompts

Use the `/` command in GitHub Copilot Chat to access prompts:

```plaintext
/awesome-copilot create-readme
```

## Security &amp; Sandboxing

Electron&#039;s contextIsolation and sandbox features are disabled to enable Teams DOM access functionality. For enhanced security, use system-level sandboxing:

**Available options**:
- **Flatpak**: Built-in isolation via Flathub
- **Snap packages**: Application confinement with auto-updates
- **Firejail**: Use this [script](https://codeberg.org/lars_uffmann/teams-for-linux-jailed) for manual sandboxing
- **AppArmor/SELinux**: Most Linux distributions include these by default

System-level sandboxing provides better isolation than Electron&#039;s built-in features while preserving full functionality.

# Get Support

If you&#039;d like business to enterprise-level support from Rajeh, the current maintainer of Baileys, you can book a video chat. Book a 1 hour time slot by contacting him on Discord or pre-ordering [here](https://purpshell.dev/book). The earlier you pre-order the better, as his time slots usually fill up very quickly. He offers immense value per hour and will answer all your questions before the time runs out.

If you are a business, we encourage you to contribute back to the high development costs of the project and to feed the maintainers who dump tens of hours a week on this. You can do so by booking meetings or sponsoring below. All support, even in bona fide / contribution hours, is welcome by businesses of all sizes. This is not condoning or endorsing businesses to use the library. See the Disclaimer below.

- Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a **WebSocket**.
- Not running Selenium or Chromium saves you like **half a gig** of ram :/
- Baileys supports interacting with the multi-device &amp; web versions of WhatsApp.
- Thank you to [@pokearaujo](https://github.com/pokearaujo/multidevice) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Multi-Device. Also, thank you to [@Sigalor](https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Web and thanks to [@Rhymen](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/) for the __go__ implementation.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; The original repository had to be removed by the original author - we now continue development in this repository here.

## Connecting Account

WhatsApp provides a multi-device API that allows Baileys to be authenticated as a second WhatsApp client by scanning a **QR code** or **Pairing Code** with WhatsApp on your phone.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **[Here](#example-to-start) is a simple example of event handling**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **You can see all supported socket configs [here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/SocketConfig.html) (Recommended)**

### Starting socket with **QR-CODE**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can customize browser name if you connect with **QR-CODE**, with `Browser` constant, we have some browsers config, **see [here](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/BrowsersMap.html)**

```ts
import makeWASocket from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    browser: Browsers.ubuntu(&#039;My App&#039;),
    printQRInTerminal: true
})
```

If the connection is successful, you will see a QR code printed on your terminal screen, scan it with WhatsApp on your phone and you&#039;ll be logged in!

### Starting socket with **Pairing Code**


&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Pairing Code isn&#039;t Mobile API, it&#039;s a method to connect Whatsapp Web without QR-CODE, you can connect only with one device, see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1324084875126592/?cms_platform=web)

The phone number can&#039;t have `+` or `()` or `-`, only numbers, you must provide country code

```ts
import makeWASocket from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    printQRInTerminal: false //need to be false
})

if (!sock.authState.creds.registered) {
    const number = &#039;XXXXXXXXXXX&#039;
    const code = await sock.requestPairingCode(number)
    console.log(code)
}
```

### Receive Full History

1. Set `syncFullHistory` as `true`
2. Baileys, by default, use chrome browser config
    - If you&#039;d like to emulate a desktop connection (and receive more message history), this browser setting to your Socket config:

```ts
const sock = makeWASocket({
    ...otherOpts,
    // can use Windows, Ubuntu here too
    browser: Browsers.macOS(&#039;Desktop&#039;),
    syncFullHistory: true
})
```

## Important Notes About Socket Config

### Caching Group Metadata (Recommended)
- If you use baileys for groups, we recommend you to set `cachedGroupMetadata` in socket config, you need to implement a cache like this:

    ```ts
    const groupCache = new NodeCache({stdTTL: 5 * 60, useClones: false})

    const sock = makeWASocket({
        cachedGroupMetadata: async (jid) =&gt; groupCache.get(jid)
    })

    sock.ev.on(&#039;groups.update&#039;, async ([event]) =&gt; {
        const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
        groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
    })

    sock.ev.on(&#039;group-participants.update&#039;, async (event) =&gt; {
        const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
        groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
    })
    ```

### Improve Retry System &amp; Decrypt Poll Votes
- If you want to improve sending message, retrying when error occurs and decrypt poll votes, you need to have a store and set `getMessage` config in socket like this:
    ```ts
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        getMessage: async (key) =&gt; await getMessageFromStore(key)
    })
    ```

### Receive Notifications in Whatsapp App
- If you want to receive notifications in whatsapp app, set `markOnlineOnConnect` to `false`
    ```ts
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        markOnlineOnConnect: false
    })
    ```
## Saving &amp; Restoring Sessions

You obviously don&#039;t want to keep scanning the QR code every time you want to connect.

So, you can load the credentials to log back in:
```ts
import makeWASocket, { useMultiFileAuthState } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;

const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState(&#039;auth_info_baileys&#039;)

// will use the given state to connect
// so if valid credentials are available -- it&#039;ll connect without QR
const sock = makeWASocket({ auth: state })

// this will be called as soon as the credentials are updated
sock.ev.on(&#039;creds.update&#039;, saveCreds)
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; `useMultiFileAuthState` is a utility function to help save the auth state in a single folder, this function serves as a good guide to help write auth &amp; key states for SQL/no-SQL databases, which I would recommend in any production grade system.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; When a message is received/sent, due to signal sessions needing updating, the auth keys (`authState.keys`) will update. Whenever that happens, you must save the updated keys (`authState.keys.set()` is called). Not doing so will prevent your messages from reaching the recipient &amp; cause other unexpected consequences. The `useMultiFileAuthState` function automatically takes care of that, but for any other serious implementation -- you will need to be very careful with the key state management.

## Handling Events

- Baileys uses the EventEmitter syntax for events.
They&#039;re all nicely typed up, so you shouldn&#039;t have any issues with an Intellisense editor like VS Code.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **The events are [these](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/types/BaileysEventMap.html)**, it&#039;s important you see all events

You can listen to these events like this:
```ts
const sock = makeWASocket()
sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.upsert&#039;, ({ messages }) =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;got messages&#039;, messages)
})
```

### Example to Start

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This example includes basic auth storage too

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; For reliable serialization of the authentication state, especially when storing as JSON, always use the BufferJSON utility.

```ts
import makeWASocket, { DisconnectReason, useMultiFileAuthState } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;
import { Boom } from &#039;@hapi/boom&#039;

async function connectToWhatsApp () {
    const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState(&#039;auth_info_baileys&#039;)
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        // can provide additional config here
        auth: state,
        printQRInTerminal: true
    })
    sock.ev.on(&#039;connection.update&#039;, (update) =&gt; {
        const { connection, lastDisconnect } = update
        if(connection === &#039;close&#039;) {
            const shouldReconnect = (lastDisconnect.error as Boom)?.output?.statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut
            console.log(&#039;connection closed due to &#039;, lastDisconnect.error, &#039;, reconnecting &#039;, shouldReconnect)
            // reconnect if not logged out
            if(shouldReconnect) {
                connectToWhatsApp()
            }
        } else if(connection === &#039;open&#039;) {
            console.log(&#039;opened connection&#039;)
        }
    })
    sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.upsert&#039;, event =&gt; {
        for (const m of event.messages) {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(m, undefined, 2))

            console.log(&#039;replying to&#039;, m.key.remoteJid)
            await sock.sendMessage(m.key.remoteJid!, { text: &#039;Hello Word&#039; })
        }
    })

    // to storage creds (session info) when it updates
    sock.ev.on(&#039;creds.update&#039;, saveCreds)
}
// run in main file
connectToWhatsApp()
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; In `messages.upsert` it&#039;s recommended to use a loop like `for (const message of event.messages)` to handle all messages in array

### Decrypt Poll Votes

- By default poll votes are encrypted and handled in `messages.update`
- That&#039;s a simple example
```ts
sock.ev.on(&#039;messages.update&#039;, event =&gt; {
    for(const { key, update } of event) {
        if(update.pollUpdates) {
            const pollCreation = await getMessage(key)
            if(pollCreation) {
                console.log(
                    &#039;got poll update, aggregation: &#039;,
                    getAggregateVotesInPollMessage({
                        message: pollCreation,
                        pollUpdates: update.pollUpdates,
                    })
                )
            }
        }
    }
})
```

- `getMessage` is a [store](#implementing-a-data-store) implementation (in your end)

### Summary of Events on First Connection

1. When you connect first time, `connection.update` will be fired requesting you to restart sock
2. Then, history messages will be received in `messaging.history-set`

## Implementing a Data Store

- Baileys does not come with a defacto storage for chats, contacts, or messages. However, a simple in-memory implementation has been provided. The store listens for chat updates, new messages, message updates, etc., to always have an up-to-date version of the data.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; I highly recommend building your own data store, as storing someone&#039;s entire chat history in memory is a terrible waste of RAM.

It can be used as follows:

```ts
import makeWASocket, { makeInMemoryStore } from &#039;@whiskeysockets/baileys&#039;
// the store maintains the data of the WA connection in memory
// can be written out to a file &amp; read from it
const store = makeInMemoryStore({ })
// can be read from a file
store.readFromFile(&#039;./baileys_store.json&#039;)
// saves the state to a file every 10s
setInterval(() =&gt; {
    store.writeToFile(&#039;./baileys_store.json&#039;)
}, 10_000)

const sock = makeWASocket({ })
// will listen from this socket
// the store can listen from a new socket once the current socket outlives its lifetime
store.bind(sock.ev)

sock.ev.on(&#039;chats.upsert&#039;, () =&gt; {
    // can use &#039;store.chats&#039; however you want, even after the socket dies out
    // &#039;chats&#039; =&gt; a KeyedDB instance
    console.log(&#039;got chats&#039;, store.chats.all())
})

sock.ev.on(&#039;contacts.upsert&#039;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;got contacts&#039;, Object.values(store.contacts))
})

```

The store also provides some simple functions such as `loadMessages` that utilize the store to speed up data retrieval.

## Whatsapp IDs Explain

- `id` is the WhatsApp ID, called `jid` too, of the person or group you&#039;re sending the message to.
    - It must be in the format ```[country code][phone number]@s.whatsapp.net```
	    - Example for people: ```+19999999999@s.whatsapp.net```.
	    - For groups, it must be in the format ``` 123456789-123345@g.us ```.
    - For broadcast lists, it&#039;s `[timestamp of creation]@broadcast`.
    - For stories, the ID is `status@broadcast`.

## Utility Functions

- `getContentType`, returns the content type for any message
- `getDevice`, returns the device from message
- `makeCacheableSignalKe

&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Rollup&lt;/h1&gt;

## Overview

Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the standardized ES module format for code, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. ES modules let you freely and seamlessly combine the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. Rollup can optimize ES modules for faster native loading in modern browsers, or output a legacy module format allowing ES module workflows today.

## Quick Start Guide

Install with `npm install --global rollup`. Rollup can be used either through a [command line interface](https://rollupjs.org/command-line-interface/) with an optional configuration file or else through its [JavaScript API](https://rollupjs.org/javascript-api/). Run `rollup --help` to see the available options and parameters. The starter project templates, [rollup-starter-lib](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-lib) and [rollup-starter-app](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-app), demonstrate common configuration options, and more detailed instructions are available throughout the [user guide](https://rollupjs.org/introduction/).

### Commands

These commands assume the entry point to your application is named main.js, and that you&#039;d like all imports compiled into a single file named bundle.js.

For browsers:

```bash
# compile to a &lt;script&gt; containing a self-executing function
rollup main.js --format iife --name &quot;myBundle&quot; --file bundle.js
```

For Node.js:

```bash
# compile to a CommonJS module
rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js
```

For both browsers and Node.js:

```bash
# UMD format requires a bundle name
rollup main.js --format umd --name &quot;myBundle&quot; --file bundle.js
```

## Why

Developing software is usually easier if you break your project into smaller separate pieces, since that often removes unexpected interactions and dramatically reduces the complexity of the problems you&#039;ll need to solve, and simply writing smaller projects in the first place [isn&#039;t necessarily the answer](https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/small-modules-it-s-not-quite-that-simple-3ca532d65de4). Unfortunately, JavaScript has not historically included this capability as a core feature in the language.

This finally changed with ES modules support in JavaScript, which provides a syntax for importing and exporting functions and data so they can be shared between separate scripts. Most browsers and Node.js support ES modules. However, Node.js releases before 12.17 support ES modules only behind the `--experimental-modules` flag, and older browsers like Internet Explorer do not support ES modules at all. Rollup allows you to write your code using ES modules, and run your application even in environments that do not support ES modules natively. For environments that support them, Rollup can output optimized ES modules; for environments that don&#039;t, Rollup can compile your code to other formats such as CommonJS modules, AMD modules, and IIFE-style scripts. This means that you get to _write future-proof code_, and you also get the tremendous benefits of...

## Tree Shaking

In addition to enabling the use of ES modules, Rollup also statically analyzes and optimizes the code you are importing, and will exclude anything that isn&#039;t actually used. This allows you to build on top of existing tools and modules without adding extra dependencies or bloating the size of your project.

For example, with CommonJS, the _entire tool or library must be imported_.

```js
// import the entire utils object with CommonJS
var utils = require(&#039;node:utils&#039;);
var query = &#039;Rollup&#039;;
// use the ajax method of the utils object
utils.ajax(&#039;https://api.example.com?search=&#039; + query).then(handleResponse);
```

But with ES modules, instead of importing the whole `utils` object, we can just import the one `ajax` function we need:

```js
// import the ajax function with an ES import statement
import { ajax } from &#039;node:utils&#039;;

var query = &#039;Rollup&#039;;
// call the ajax function
ajax(&#039;https://api.example.com?search=&#039; + query).then(handleResponse);
```

Because Rollup includes the bare minimum, it results in lighter, faster, and less complicated libraries and applications. Since this approach is based on explicit `import` and `export` statements, it is vastly more effective than simply running an automated minifier to detect unused variables in the compiled output code.

## Compatibility

### Importing CommonJS

Rollup can import existing CommonJS modules [through a plugin](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs).

### Publishing ES Modules

To make sure your ES modules are immediately usable by tools that work with CommonJS such as Node.js and webpack, you can use Rollup to compile to UMD or CommonJS format, and then point to that compiled version with the `main` property in your `package.json` file. If your `package.json` file also has a `module` field, ES-module-aware tools like Rollup and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) will [import the ES module version](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module) directly.
