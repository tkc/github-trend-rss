### Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?

Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don&#039;t plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.

Documentation is still available but it&#039;s moved to
[https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0) and
[https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1](https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1).

The Git repository for
[v4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v4.7.0) and
[v3.2.1](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases/tag/v3.2.1) can
be found in our GitHub releases.

## Change log

We&#039;ll keep track of each release in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we&#039;ll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.

Check out the [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) guide when you upgrade your dependencies.

## Code of conduct

We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included
are directions for opening issues.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.

**The major version &quot;5&quot; is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.
- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.
- Code — MIT License
  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn&#039;t need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We&#039;ve kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They&#039;re a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

#### 3. Tag Clustering (`analysis_pipeline/cluster_tags.ts`)
**Purpose:** Group 28,000+ tags into semantic clusters
**Input:** All unique tags from database
**Output:** `tag_clusters.json` with 30 clusters
**Process:**
1. Collect all unique tags from triples
2. Generate or load cached embeddings using Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX
3. Run K-means clustering with K-means++ initialization
4. Generate human-readable cluster names from exemplar tags
5. Save cluster assignments with full tag lists

**Technical Details:**
- **Algorithm:** K-means with cosine distance metric
- **Initialization:** K-means++ for better convergence
- **Convergence:** Typically ~85 iterations
- **Complexity:** O(n·k·i) - much faster than hierarchical methods
- **Output:** 30 clusters ranging from 500-1400 tags each

#### 4. Entity Deduplication (`analysis_pipeline/dedupe_with_llm.ts`)
**Purpose:** Merge duplicate entity mentions
**Input:** Entity names from database
**Output:** `entity_aliases` table mapping variants to canonical names
**Process:**
1. Identify potential duplicates using fuzzy matching
2. Use Claude to determine if entities are the same person
3. Create alias mappings (e.g., &quot;Jeff Epstein&quot; → &quot;Jeffrey Epstein&quot;)
4. API server resolves aliases in real-time

#### 5. Migration Scripts
**`analysis_pipeline/update_top_clusters.ts`**
- Adds and populates `top_cluster_ids` column to `rdf_triples`
- Computes top 3 clusters for each triple based on tag matches
- Creates index for fast filtering
- Improves query performance by 10x+

---

### API Server (`api_server.ts`)

**Purpose:** Express.js backend serving data and frontend
**Port:** 3001 (configurable via `PORT` env var)
**Technology:** Express, better-sqlite3, CORS

#### Key Endpoints

**`GET /api/stats`**
- Returns database statistics (document count, triple count, actor count)
- Shows top document categories

**`GET /api/tag-clusters`**
- Returns all 30 tag clusters with metadata
- Includes cluster names, exemplar tags, and tag counts

**`GET /api/relationships?limit=9600&amp;clusters=0,1,2&amp;maxHops=3`**
- Returns relationship network filtered by clusters and hop distance
- Applies density-based pruning (highest-degree nodes prioritized)
- Edge deduplication before limiting (slider value = unique visual edges)
- Returns metadata: `{ relationships, totalBeforeLimit, totalBeforeFilter }`
- Uses materialized `top_cluster_ids` for fast filtering

**`GET /api/actor/:name/relationships?clusters=0,1,2`**
- Returns all relationships for a specific actor
- Handles entity aliases (resolves variants to canonical names)
- Filtered by selected tag clusters
- Returns: `{ relationships, totalBeforeFilter }`

**`GET /api/search?q=query`**
- Searches for actors by name
- Returns fuzzy matches with relationship counts

**`GET /api/document/:docId`**
- Returns document metadata
- Includes category, doc_id, file path

**`GET /api/document/:docId/text`**
- Returns full document text
- Used for document viewer modal

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Materialized Clusters:** Pre-computed top 3 clusters per triple
- **Indexed Columns:** Indexes on `top_cluster_ids`, `actor`, `target`
- **Database Limits:** 100k row limit to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Alias Resolution:** Efficient LEFT JOIN on entity_aliases
- **Rate Limiting:** 1000 requests per 15 minutes per IP

### Visualization Interface

#### Frontend Architecture (`network-ui/`)

**Technology Stack:**
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **react-force-graph-2d** for network visualization
- **D3.js** for force simulation

#### Key Components

**`App.tsx`** - Main application container
- Manages global state (relationships, selected actor, filters)
- Loads tag clusters and enables all by default
- Coordinates data fetching and updates
- Handles desktop/mobile layout switching

**`NetworkGraph.tsx`** - Force-directed graph visualization
- Renders nodes (actors) and links (relationships)
- Node size based on connection count
- Click actors to select/deselect
- Zoom and pan controls
- Performance: Handles 15,000+ relationships smoothly

**`Sidebar.tsx`** - Desktop left sidebar
- Displays database statistics
- Actor search with autocomplete
- Relationship limit slider (100-25,000, default 9,600 desktop / 3,000 mobile)
- Hop distance filter (1-10 hops from Jeffrey Epstein, default 3)
- Tag cluster filter buttons
- Document category breakdown

**`RightSidebar.tsx`** - Desktop right sidebar (actor details)
- Shows when actor is selected
- Timeline view of actor&#039;s relationships
- &quot;Showing X of Y relationships&quot; indicator
- Document links with click-to-view

**`MobileBottomNav.tsx`** - Mobile navigation
- Tabbed interface: Search, Timeline, Filters
- Condensed version of desktop sidebars
- Touch-optimized controls

**`DocumentModal.tsx`** - Full-text document viewer
- Displays complete document text
- Highlights actor names in context
- Scrollable with close button
- Fetches text on demand

**`WelcomeModal.tsx`** - First-time visitor welcome
- Introduces users to the explorer
- Stored in localStorage (shown once)
- Dismissible

#### State Management

**Global State (in App.tsx):**
```typescript
const [stats, setStats] = useState&lt;Stats | null&gt;(null);
const [tagClusters, setTagClusters] = useState&lt;TagCluster[]&gt;([]);
const [relationships, setRelationships] = useState&lt;Relationship[]&gt;([]);
const [totalBeforeLimit, setTotalBeforeLimit] = useState&lt;number&gt;(0);
const [selectedActor, setSelectedActor] = useState&lt;string | null&gt;(null);
const [actorRelationships, setActorRelationships] = useState&lt;Relationship[]&gt;([]);
const [actorTotalBeforeFilter, setActorTotalBeforeFilter] = useState&lt;number&gt;(0);
const [limit, setLimit] = useState(isMobile ? 3000 : 9600);
const [maxHops, setMaxHops] = useState&lt;number | null&gt;(3);
const [minDensity, setMinDensity] = useState(50);
const [enabledClusterIds, setEnabledClusterIds] = useState&lt;Set&lt;number&gt;&gt;(new Set());
```

**Data Flow:**
1. Load tag clusters on mount → enable all clusters
2. Fetch relationships when limit or clusters change
3. Fetch actor relationships when actor selected or clusters change
4. Update graph when relationships change

#### Responsive Design
- **Desktop (&gt;1024px):** Dual sidebar layout with main graph
- **Mobile (&lt;1024px):** Full-screen graph with bottom navigation
- **Adaptive Limits:** Mobile defaults to 3k relationships, desktop 9.6k

### Product Overview

AnythingLLM is a full-stack application where you can use commercial off-the-shelf LLMs or popular open source LLMs and vectorDB solutions to build a private ChatGPT with no compromises that you can run locally as well as host remotely and be able to chat intelligently with any documents you provide it.

AnythingLLM divides your documents into objects called `workspaces`. A Workspace functions a lot like a thread, but with the addition of containerization of your documents. Workspaces can share documents, but they do not talk to each other so you can keep your context for each workspace clean.

### Technical Overview

This monorepo consists of six main sections:

- `frontend`: A viteJS + React frontend that you can run to easily create and manage all your content the LLM can use.
- `server`: A NodeJS express server to handle all the interactions and do all the vectorDB management and LLM interactions.
- `collector`: NodeJS express server that processes and parses documents from the UI.
- `docker`: Docker instructions and build process + information for building from source.
- `embed`: Submodule for generation &amp; creation of the [web embed widget](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-embed).
- `browser-extension`: Submodule for the [chrome browser extension](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-extension).

## How to setup for development

- `yarn setup` To fill in the required `.env` files you&#039;ll need in each of the application sections (from root of repo).
  - Go fill those out before proceeding. Ensure `server/.env.development` is filled or else things won&#039;t work right.
- `yarn dev:server` To boot the server locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:frontend` To boot the frontend locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:collector` To then run the document collector (from root of repo).

## Telemetry &amp; Privacy

AnythingLLM by Mintplex Labs Inc contains a telemetry feature that collects anonymous usage information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;More about Telemetry &amp; Privacy for AnythingLLM&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

### Why?

We use this information to help us understand how AnythingLLM is used, to help us prioritize work on new features and bug fixes, and to help us improve AnythingLLM&#039;s performance and stability.

### Opting out

Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` in your server or docker .env settings to &quot;true&quot; to opt out of telemetry. You can also do this in-app by going to the sidebar &gt; `Privacy` and disabling telemetry.

### What do you explicitly track?

We will only track usage details that help us make product and roadmap decisions, specifically:

- Type of your installation (Docker or Desktop)

- When a document is added or removed. No information _about_ the document. Just that the event occurred. This gives us an idea of use.

- Type of vector database in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider.

- Type of LLM provider &amp; model tag in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider or model, or combination thereof. eg: reasoning vs regular, multi-modal models, etc.

- When a chat is sent. This is the most regular &quot;event&quot; and gives us an idea of the daily-activity of this project across all installations. Again, only the **event** is sent - we have no information on the nature or content of the chat itself.

You can verify these claims by finding all locations `Telemetry.sendTelemetry` is called. Additionally these events are written to the output log so you can also see the specific data which was sent - if enabled. **No IP or other identifying information is collected**. The Telemetry provider is [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) - an open-source telemetry collection service.

We take privacy very seriously, and we hope you understand that we want to learn how our tool is used, without using annoying popup surveys, so we can build something worth using. The anonymous data is _never_ shared with third parties, ever.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># npm - a JavaScript package manager

### Requirements

You should be running a currently supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run **`npm`**.  For a list of which versions of Node.js are currently supported, please see the [Node.js releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) page.

### Installation

**`npm`** comes bundled with [**`node`**](https://nodejs.org/), &amp; most third-party distributions, by default. Officially supported downloads/distributions can be found at: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### Direct Download

You can download &amp; install **`npm`** directly from [**npmjs**.com](https://npmjs.com/) using our custom `install.sh` script:

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### Node Version Managers

If you&#039;re looking to manage multiple versions of **`Node.js`** &amp;/or **`npm`**, consider using a [node version manager](https://github.com/search?q=node+version+manager+archived%3Afalse&amp;type=repositories&amp;ref=advsearch)

### Usage

```bash
npm &lt;command&gt;
```

### Links &amp; Resources

* [**Documentation**](https://docs.npmjs.com/) - Official docs &amp; how-tos for all things **npm**
    * Note: you can also search docs locally with `npm help-search &lt;query&gt;`
* [**Bug Tracker**](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues) - Search or submit bugs against the CLI
* [**Community Feedback and Discussions**](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/npm) - Contribute ideas &amp; discussion around the npm registry, website &amp; CLI
* [**RFCs**](https://github.com/npm/rfcs) - Contribute ideas &amp; specifications for the API/design of the npm CLI
* [**Service Status**](https://status.npmjs.org/) - Monitor the current status &amp; see incident reports for the website &amp; registry
* [**Project Status**](https://npm.github.io/statusboard/) - See the health of all our maintained OSS projects in one view
* [**Support**](https://www.npmjs.com/support) - Experiencing problems with the **npm** [website](https://npmjs.com) or [registry](https://registry.npmjs.org)? [File a ticket](https://www.npmjs.com/support)

### Acknowledgments

* `npm` is configured to use the **npm Public Registry** at [https://registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org) by default; Usage of this registry is subject to **Terms of Use** available at [https://npmjs.com/policies/terms](https://npmjs.com/policies/terms)
* You can configure `npm` to use any other compatible registry you prefer. You can read more about [configuring third-party registries](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/registry)

### FAQ on Branding

#### Is it &quot;npm&quot; or &quot;NPM&quot; or &quot;Npm&quot;?

**`npm`** should never be capitalized unless it is being displayed in a location that is customarily all-capitals (ex. titles on `man` pages).

#### Is &quot;npm&quot; an acronym for &quot;Node Package Manager&quot;?

Contrary to popular belief, **`npm`** **is not** in fact an acronym for &quot;Node Package Manager&quot;; It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for **&quot;npm is not an acronym&quot;** (if the project was named &quot;ninaa&quot;, then it would be an acronym). The precursor to **`npm`** was actually a bash utility named **&quot;pm&quot;**, which was the shortform name of **&quot;pkgmakeinst&quot;** - a bash function that installed various things on various platforms. If **`npm`** were to ever have been considered an acronym, it would be as &quot;node pm&quot; or, potentially &quot;new pm&quot;.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Defillama Adapters

Follow [this guide](https://docs.llama.fi/submit-a-project) to create an adapter and submit a PR with it.

Also, don&#039;t hesitate to send a message on [our discord](https://discord.defillama.com/) if we&#039;re late to merge your PR.

&gt; If you would like to add a `volume` adapter please submit the PR [here](https://github.com/DefiLlama/adapters)
&gt; - If you would like to add a `liquidations` adapter, please refer to [this readme document](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/tree/main/liquidations) for details.

1. PLEASE PLEASE **enable &quot;Allow edits by maintainers&quot; while putting up the PR.**
2. Once your adapter has been merged, it takes time to show on the UI. No need to notify us on Discord.
3. TVL must be computed from blockchain data (reason: https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/discussions/432), if you have trouble with creating the adapter, please hop onto our discord, we are happy to assist you.
4. **For updating listing info** It is a different repo, you can find your listing in this file: https://github.com/DefiLlama/defillama-server/blob/master/defi/src/protocols/data2.ts, you can  edit it there and put up a PR
5. Do not edit/push `package-lock.json` file as part of your changes, we use lockfileVersion 2, and most use v1 and using that messes up our CI
6. No need to go to our discord and announce that you&#039;ve created a PR, we monitor all PRs and will review it asap

## Getting listed

Please send answers to questions there https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/blob/main/pull_request_template.md when creating a PR.

## Work in progress

This is a work in progress. DefiLlama aims to be transparent, accurate, and open source.

If you have any suggestions, want to contribute or want to chat, please join [our discord](https://discord.defillama.com/) and drop a message.

## Testing adapters
```bash
node test.js projects/pangolin/index.js
# Add a timestamp at the end to run the adapter at a historical timestamp
node test.js projects/aave/v3.js 1729080692
# or using YYYY-MM-DD
node test.js projects/aave/v3.js 2024-10-16
```

## Changing RPC providers
If you want to change RPC providers because you need archive node access or because the default ones don&#039;t work well enough you can do so by creating an `.env` file and filling it with the env variables to overwrite:
```
ETHEREUM_RPC=&quot;...&quot;
BSC_RPC=&quot;...&quot;
POLYGON_RPC=&quot;...&quot;
```

The name of each rpc is `{CHAIN-NAME}_RPC`, and the name we use for each chain can be found [here](https://unpkg.com/@defillama/sdk@latest/build/providers.json). If you run into issues with a chain make sure to update the sdk with `npm update @defillama/sdk`.

## Adapter rules
- Never add extra npm packages, if you need a chain-level package for your chain, ask us, and we&#039;ll consider it, but we can&#039;t accept any npm package that is project-specific

**A library to generate PDFs in JavaScript.**

You can [catch me on twitter](http://twitter.com/MrRio): [@MrRio](http://twitter.com/MrRio) or head over to [my company&#039;s website](http://parall.ax) for consultancy.

jsPDF is now co-maintained by [yWorks - the diagramming experts](https://www.yworks.com/).

## [Live Demo](http://raw.githack.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/) | [Documentation](http://raw.githack.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/docs/)

## Install

Recommended: get jsPDF from npm:

```sh
npm install jspdf --save
# or
yarn add jspdf
```

Alternatively, load it from a CDN:

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/4.1.0/jspdf.umd.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Or always get latest version via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/jspdf/)

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/jspdf@latest/dist/jspdf.umd.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

The `dist` folder of this package contains different kinds of files:

- **jspdf.es.\*.js**: Modern ES2015 module format.
- **jspdf.node.\*.js**: For running in Node. Uses file operations for loading/saving files instead of browser APIs.
- **jspdf.umd.\*.js**: UMD module format. For AMD or script-tag loading.
- **polyfills\*.js**: Required polyfills for older browsers like Internet Explorer. The es variant simply imports all
  required polyfills from `core-js`, the umd variant is self-contained.

Usually it is not necessary to specify the exact file in the import statement. Build tools or Node automatically figure
out the right file, so importing &quot;jspdf&quot; is enough.

## Usage

Then you&#039;re ready to start making your document:

```javascript
import { jsPDF } from &quot;jspdf&quot;;

// Default export is a4 paper, portrait, using millimeters for units
const doc = new jsPDF();

doc.text(&quot;Hello world!&quot;, 10, 10);
doc.save(&quot;a4.pdf&quot;);
```

If you want to change the paper size, orientation, or units, you can do:

```javascript
// Landscape export, 2×4 inches
const doc = new jsPDF({
  orientation: &quot;landscape&quot;,
  unit: &quot;in&quot;,
  format: [4, 2]
});

doc.text(&quot;Hello world!&quot;, 1, 1);
doc.save(&quot;two-by-four.pdf&quot;);
```

### Running in Node.js

```javascript
const { jsPDF } = require(&quot;jspdf&quot;); // will automatically load the node version

const doc = new jsPDF();
doc.text(&quot;Hello world!&quot;, 10, 10);
doc.save(&quot;a4.pdf&quot;); // will save the file in the current working directory
```

### Other Module Formats

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;AMD&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/summary&gt;

```js
require([&quot;jspdf&quot;], ({ jsPDF }) =&gt; {
  const doc = new jsPDF();
  doc.text(&quot;Hello world!&quot;, 10, 10);
  doc.save(&quot;a4.pdf&quot;);
});
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Globals&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/summary&gt;

```js
const { jsPDF } = window.jspdf;

const doc = new jsPDF();
doc.text(&quot;Hello world!&quot;, 10, 10);
doc.save(&quot;a4.pdf&quot;);
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Security

We strongly advise you to sanitize user input before passing it to jsPDF!

For reporting security vulnerabilities, please see [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

### Reading files from the local file system on node

When running under Node.js, jsPDF will restrict reading files from the local file system by default.

Strongly recommended: use Node&#039;s permission flags so the runtime enforces access:

```sh
node --permission --allow-fs-read=... ./scripts/generate.js
```

See [Node&#039;s documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html) for details. Note that you need to include
all imported JavaScript files (including all dependencies) in the `--allow-fs-read` flag.

Fallback (not recommended): you can allow jsPDF to read specific files by setting `jsPDF.allowFsRead` in your script.

```js
import { jsPDF } from &quot;jspdf&quot;;

const doc = new jsPDF();
doc.allowFsRead = [&quot;./fonts/*&quot;, &quot;./images/logo.png&quot;]; // allow everything under ./fonts and a single file
```

Warning: We strongly recommend the Node flags over `jsPDF.allowFsRead`, as the flags are enforced by the runtime and offer stronger security.

### Optional dependencies

Some functions of jsPDF require optional dependencies. E.g. the `html` method, which depends on `html2canvas` and,
when supplied with a string HTML document, `dompurify`. JsPDF loads them dynamically when required
(using the respective module format, e.g. dynamic imports). Build tools like Webpack will automatically create separate
chunks for each of the optional dependencies. If your application does not use any of the optional dependencies, you
can prevent Webpack from generating the chunks by defining them as external dependencies:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  externals: {
    // only define the dependencies you are NOT using as externals!
    canvg: &quot;canvg&quot;,
    html2canvas: &quot;html2canvas&quot;,
    dompurify: &quot;dompurify&quot;
  }
};
```

In **Vue CLI** projects, externals can be defined via the [configureWebpack](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#configurewebpack)
or [chainWebpack](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#chainwebpack) properties of the `vue.config.js` file
(needs to be created, first, in fresh projects).

In **Angular** projects, externals can be defined using
[custom webpack builders](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack).

In **React** (`create-react-app`) projects, externals can be defined by either using
[react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) or ejecting.

### TypeScript/Angular/Webpack/React/etc. Configuration:

jsPDF can be imported just like any other 3rd party library. This works with all major toolkits and frameworks. jsPDF
also offers a typings file for TypeScript projects.

```js
import { jsPDF } from &quot;jspdf&quot;;
```

You can add jsPDF to your meteor-project as follows:

```
meteor add jspdf:core
```

### Polyfills

jsPDF requires modern browser APIs in order to function. To use jsPDF in older browsers like Internet Explorer,
polyfills are required. You can load all required polyfills as follows:

```js
import &quot;jspdf/dist/polyfills.es.js&quot;;
```

Alternatively, you can load the prebundled polyfill file. This is not recommended, since you might end up
loading polyfills multiple times. Might still be nifty for small applications or quick POCs.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/4.1.0/polyfills.umd.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Use of Unicode Characters / UTF-8:

The 14 standard fonts in PDF are limited to the ASCII-codepage. If you want to use UTF-8 you have to integrate a
custom font, which provides the needed glyphs. jsPDF supports .ttf-files. So if you want to have for example
Chinese text in your pdf, your font has to have the necessary Chinese glyphs. So, check if your font supports
the wanted glyphs or else it will show garbled characters instead of the right text.

To add the font to jsPDF use our fontconverter in
[/fontconverter/fontconverter.html](https://rawgit.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/fontconverter/fontconverter.html).
The fontconverter will create a js-file with the content of the provided ttf-file as base64 encoded string
and additional code for jsPDF. You just have to add this generated js-File to your project.
You are then ready to go to use setFont-method in your code and write your UTF-8 encoded text.

Alternatively you can just load the content of the \*.ttf file as a binary string using `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` and
add the font to the PDF file:

```js
const doc = new jsPDF();

const myFont = ... // load the *.ttf font file as binary string

// add the font to jsPDF
doc.addFileToVFS(&quot;MyFont.ttf&quot;, myFont);
doc.addFont(&quot;MyFont.ttf&quot;, &quot;MyFont&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;);
doc.setFont(&quot;MyFont&quot;);
```

## Advanced Functionality

Since the merge with the [yWorks fork](https://github.com/yWorks/jsPDF) there are a lot of new features. However, some
of them are API breaking, which is why there is an API-switch between two API modes:

- In &quot;compat&quot; API mode, jsPDF has the same API as MrRio&#039;s original version, which means full compatibility with plugins.
  However, some advanced features like transformation matrices and patterns won&#039;t work. This is the default mode.
- In &quot;advanced&quot; API mode, jsPDF has the API you&#039;re used from the yWorks-fork version. This means the availability of
  all advanced features like patterns, FormObjects, and transformation matrices.

You can switch between the two modes by calling

```javascript
doc.advancedAPI(doc =&gt; {
  // your code
});
// or
doc.compatAPI(doc =&gt; {
  // your code
});
```

JsPDF will automatically switch back to the original API mode after the callback has run.

# Introduction

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) designed to teach web
application security lessons.

This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The
exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and
penetration testing techniques.

**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
this program.*  WebGoat&#039;s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
the exposure.

**WARNING 2:** *This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
first thing that all hackers claim.*

# Installation instructions:

For more details check [the Contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 1. Run using Docker

Already have a browser and ZAP and/or Burp installed on your machine in this case you can run the WebGoat image directly using Docker.

Every release is also published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/webgoat/webgoat).

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 webgoat/webgoat
```

For some lessons you need the container run in the same timezone. For this you can set the TZ environment variable.
E.g.

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

If you want to use OWASP ZAP or another proxy, you can no longer use 127.0.0.1 or localhost. but
you can use custom host entries. For example:

```shell
127.0.0.1 www.webgoat.local www.webwolf.local
```

Then you can run the container with:

```shell
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e WEBGOAT_HOST=www.webgoat.local -e WEBWOLF_HOST=www.webwolf.local -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
```

Then visit http://www.webgoat.local:8080/WebGoat/ and http://www.webwolf.local:9090/WebWolf/

## 2. Run using Docker with complete Linux Desktop

Instead of installing tools locally we have a complete Docker image based on running a desktop in your browser. This way you only have to run a Docker image which will give you the best user experience.

```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 webgoat/webgoat-desktop
```

## 3. Standalone

Download the latest WebGoat release from [https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases)

```shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar
```

Click the link in the log to start WebGoat.

### 3.1 Running on a different port

If for some reason you want to run WebGoat on a different port, you can do so by adding the following parameter:

```shell
java -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar --webgoat.port=8001 --webwolf.port=8002
```

For a full overview of all the parameters you can use, please check the [WebGoat properties file](webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application-{webgoat, webwolf}.properties).

## 4. Run from the sources

### Prerequisites:

* Java 25
* Your favorite IDE
* Git, or Git support in your IDE

Open a command shell/window:

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:WebGoat/WebGoat.git
```

Now let&#039;s start by compiling the project.

```Shell
cd WebGoat
git checkout &lt;&lt;branch_name&gt;&gt;
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw clean install

# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd clean install

# Using docker or podman, you can than build the container locally
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t webgoat/webgoat
```

Now we are ready to run the project. WebGoat is using Spring Boot.

```Shell
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

```

... you should be running WebGoat on http://localhost:8080/WebGoat momentarily.

Note: The above link will redirect you to login page if you are not logged in. LogIn/Create account to proceed.

To change the IP address add the following variable to the `WebGoat/webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

```
server.address=x.x.x.x
```

## 4. Run with custom menu

For specialist only. There is a way to set up WebGoat with a personalized menu. You can leave out some menu categories or individual lessons by setting certain environment variables.

For instance running as a jar on a Linux/macOS it will look like this:

```Shell
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
export EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot;
export EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot;
java -jar target/webgoat-2023.8-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

```Shell
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES=&quot;CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE&quot; -e EXCLUDE_LESSONS=&quot;SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations&quot; webgoat/webgoat
```
