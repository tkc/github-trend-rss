This project comes as a pre-built docker image that enables you to easily forward to your websites
running at home or otherwise, including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx or Letsencrypt.

- [Quick Setup](#quick-setup)

## Project Goal

I created this project to fill a personal need to provide users with an easy way to accomplish reverse
proxying hosts with SSL termination and it had to be so easy that a monkey could do it. This goal hasn&#039;t changed.
While there might be advanced options they are optional and the project should be as simple as possible
so that the barrier for entry here is low.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jc21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://public.jc21.com/github/by-me-a-coffee.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buy Me A Coffee&quot; style=&quot;height: 51px !important;width: 217px !important;&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;


## Features

- Beautiful and Secure Admin Interface based on [Tabler](https://tabler.github.io/)
- Easily create forwarding domains, redirections, streams and 404 hosts without knowing anything about Nginx
- Free SSL using Let&#039;s Encrypt or provide your own custom SSL certificates
- Access Lists and basic HTTP Authentication for your hosts
- Advanced Nginx configuration available for super users
- User management, permissions and audit log


## Hosting your home network

I won&#039;t go in to too much detail here but here are the basics for someone new to this self-hosted world.

1. Your home router will have a Port Forwarding section somewhere. Log in and find it
2. Add port forwarding for port 80 and 443 to the server hosting this project
3. Configure your domain name details to point to your home, either with a static ip or a service like DuckDNS or [Amazon Route53](https://github.com/jc21/route53-ddns)
4. Use the Nginx Proxy Manager as your gateway to forward to your other web based services

## Quick Setup

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose

- [Docker Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker-Compose Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file similar to this:

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: &#039;docker.io/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest&#039;
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - &#039;80:80&#039;
      - &#039;81:81&#039;
      - &#039;443:443&#039;
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

This is the bare minimum configuration required. See the [documentation](https://nginxproxymanager.com/setup/) for more.

3. Bring up your stack by running

```bash
docker-compose up -d

# If using docker-compose-plugin
docker compose up -d

```

4. Log in to the Admin UI

When your docker container is running, connect to it on port `81` for the admin interface.
Sometimes this can take a little bit because of the entropy of keys.

[http://127.0.0.1:81](http://127.0.0.1:81)

Default Admin User:
```
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme
```

Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify your details and change your password.

## What and why

Since the start of modern AI in late 2022 we&#039;ve seen an **_extraordinary_** number of AI applications for accomplishing tasks. There are thousands of websites, chat-bots, mobile apps, and other interfaces for using all the different AI out there.

It&#039;s all really exciting and powerful, but _it&#039;s not easy to integrate this functionality into our lives._

&lt;p class=&quot;align center&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In other words, AI doesn&#039;t have a capabilities problem—it has an &lt;em&gt;integration&lt;/em&gt; problem.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**Fabric was created to address this by creating and organizing the fundamental units of AI—the prompts themselves!**

Fabric organizes prompts by real-world task, allowing people to create, collect, and organize their most important AI solutions in a single place for use in their favorite tools. And if you&#039;re command-line focused, you can use Fabric itself as the interface!

## Updates

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt;June 17, 2025
&gt;
&gt;- Fabric now supports Perplexity AI. Configure it by using `fabric -S` to add your Perplexity AI API Key,
&gt;   and then try:
&gt;
&gt;   ```bash
&gt;   fabric -m sonar-pro &quot;What is the latest world news?&quot;
&gt;   ```
&gt;
&gt;June 11, 2025
&gt;
&gt;- Fabric&#039;s YouTube transcription now needs `yt-dlp` to be installed. Make sure to install the latest
&gt; version (2025.06.09 as of this note). The YouTube API key is only needed for comments (the `--comments` flag)
&gt; and metadata extraction (the `--metadata` flag).

## Philosophy

&gt; AI isn&#039;t a thing; it&#039;s a _magnifier_ of a thing. And that thing is **human creativity**.

We believe the purpose of technology is to help humans flourish, so when we talk about AI we start with the **human** problems we want to solve.

### Breaking problems into components

Our approach is to break problems into individual pieces (see below) and then apply AI to them one at a time. See below for some examples.

&lt;img width=&quot;2078&quot; alt=&quot;augmented_challenges&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/assets/50654/31997394-85a9-40c2-879b-b347e4701f06&quot;&gt;

### Too many prompts

Prompts are good for this, but the biggest challenge I faced in 2023——which still exists today—is **the sheer number of AI prompts out there**. We all have prompts that are useful, but it&#039;s hard to discover new ones, know if they are good or not, _and manage different versions of the ones we like_.

One of `fabric`&#039;s primary features is helping people collect and integrate prompts, which we call _Patterns_, into various parts of their lives.

Fabric has Patterns for all sorts of life and work activities, including:

- Extracting the most interesting parts of YouTube videos and podcasts
- Writing an essay in your own voice with just an idea as an input
- Summarizing opaque academic papers
- Creating perfectly matched AI art prompts for a piece of writing
- Rating the quality of content to see if you want to read/watch the whole thing
- Getting summaries of long, boring content
- Explaining code to you
- Turning bad documentation into usable documentation
- Creating social media posts from any content input
- And a million more…

## Installation

To install Fabric, you can use the latest release binaries or install it from the source.

### Get Latest Release Binaries

#### Windows

`https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-windows-amd64.exe`

#### macOS (arm64)

`curl -L https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-darwin-arm64 &gt; fabric &amp;&amp; chmod +x fabric &amp;&amp; ./fabric --version`

#### macOS (amd64)

`curl -L https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-darwin-amd64 &gt; fabric &amp;&amp; chmod +x fabric &amp;&amp; ./fabric --version`

#### Linux (amd64)

`curl -L https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-linux-amd64 &gt; fabric &amp;&amp; chmod +x fabric &amp;&amp; ./fabric --version`

#### Linux (arm64)

`curl -L https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-linux-arm64 &gt; fabric &amp;&amp; chmod +x fabric &amp;&amp; ./fabric --version`

### Using package managers

**NOTE:** using Homebrew or the Arch Linux package managers makes `fabric` available as `fabric-ai`, so add
the following alias to your shell startup files to account for this:

```bash
alias fabric=&#039;fabric-ai&#039;
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

`brew install fabric-ai`

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

`yay -S fabric-ai`

### From Source

To install Fabric, [make sure Go is installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), and then run the following command.

```bash
# Install Fabric directly from the repo
go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest
```

### Environment Variables

You may need to set some environment variables in your `~/.bashrc` on linux or `~/.zshrc` file on mac to be able to run the `fabric` command. Here is an example of what you can add:

For Intel based macs or linux

```bash
# Golang environment variables
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go

# Update PATH to include GOPATH and GOROOT binaries
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

for Apple Silicon based macs

```bash
# Golang environment variables
export GOROOT=$(brew --prefix go)/libexec
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

### Setup

Now run the following command

```bash
# Run the setup to set up your directories and keys
fabric --setup
```

If everything works you are good to go.

### Add aliases for all patterns

In order to add aliases for all your patterns and use them directly as commands ie. `summarize` instead of `fabric --pattern summarize`
You can add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.

```bash
# Loop through all files in the ~/.config/fabric/patterns directory
for pattern_file in $HOME/.config/fabric/patterns/*; do
    # Get the base name of the file (i.e., remove the directory path)
    pattern_name=$(basename &quot;$pattern_file&quot;)

    # Create an alias in the form: alias pattern_name=&quot;fabric --pattern pattern_name&quot;
    alias_command=&quot;alias $pattern_name=&#039;fabric --pattern $pattern_name&#039;&quot;

    # Evaluate the alias command to add it to the current shell
    eval &quot;$alias_command&quot;
done

yt() {
    if [ &quot;$#&quot; -eq 0 ] || [ &quot;$#&quot; -gt 2 ]; then
        echo &quot;Usage: yt [-t | --timestamps] youtube-link&quot;
        echo &quot;Use the &#039;-t&#039; flag to get the transcript with timestamps.&quot;
        return 1
    fi

    transcript_flag=&quot;--transcript&quot;
    if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;-t&quot; ] || [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;--timestamps&quot; ]; then
        transcript_flag=&quot;--transcript-with-timestamps&quot;
        shift
    fi
    local video_link=&quot;$1&quot;
    fabric -y &quot;$video_link&quot; $transcript_flag
}
```

You can add the below code for the equivalent aliases inside PowerShell by running `notepad $PROFILE` inside a PowerShell window:

```powershell
# Path to the patterns directory
$patternsPath = Join-Path $HOME &quot;.config/fabric/patterns&quot;
foreach ($patternDir in Get-ChildItem -Path $patternsPath -Directory) {
    $patternName = $patternDir.Name

    # Dynamically define a function for each pattern
    $functionDefinition = @&quot;
function $patternName {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline = `$true)]
        [string] `$InputObject,

        [Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments = `$true)]
        [String[]] `$patternArgs
    )

    begin {
        # Initialize an array to collect pipeline input
        `$collector = @()
    }

    process {
        # Collect pipeline input objects
        if (`$InputObject) {
            `$collector += `$InputObject
        }
    }

    end {
        # Join all pipeline input into a single string, separated by newlines
        `$pipelineContent = `$collector -join &quot;`n&quot;

        # If there&#039;s pipeline input, include it in the call to fabric
        if (`$pipelineContent) {
            `$pipelineContent | fabric --pattern $patternName `$patternArgs
        } else {
            # No pipeline input; just call fabric with the additional args
            fabric --pattern $patternName `$patternArgs
        }
    }
}
&quot;@
    # Add the function to the current session
    Invoke-Expression $functionDefinition
}

# Define the &#039;yt&#039; function as well
function yt {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter()]
        [Alias(&quot;timestamps&quot;)]
        [switch]$t,

        [Parameter(Position = 0, ValueFromPipeline = $true)]
        [string]$videoLink
    )

    begin {
        $transcriptFlag = &quot;--transcript&quot;
        if ($t) {
            $transcriptFlag = &quot;--transcript-with-timestamps&quot;
        }
    }

    process {
        if (-not $videoLink) {
            Write-Error &quot;Usage: yt [-t | --timestamps] youtube-link&quot;
            return
        }
    }

    end {
        if ($videoLink) {
            # Execute and allow output to flow through the pipeline
            fabric -y $videoLink $transcriptFlag
        }
    }
}
```

This also creates a `yt` alias that allows you to use `yt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b0iet22VIk` to get transcripts, comments, and metadata.

#### Save your files in markdown using aliases

If in addition to the above aliases you would like to have the option to save the output to your favorite markdown note vault like Obsidian then instead of the above add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```bash
# Define the base directory for Obsidian notes
obsidian_base=&quot;/path/to/obsidian&quot;

# Loop through all files in the ~/.config/fabric/patterns directory
for pattern_file in ~/.config/fabric/patterns/*; do
    # Get the base name of the file (i.e., remove the directory path)
    pattern_name=$(basename &quot;$pattern_file&quot;)

    # Remove any existing alias with the same name
    unalias &quot;$pattern_name&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null

    # Define a function dynamically for each pattern
    eval &quot;
    $pattern_name() {
        local title=\$1
        local date_stamp=\$(date +&#039;%Y-%m-%d&#039;)
        local output_path=\&quot;\$obsidian_base/\${date_stamp}-\${title}.md\&quot;

        # Check if a title was provided
        if [ -n \&quot;\$title\&quot; ]; then
            # If a title is provided, use the output path
            fabric --pattern \&quot;$pattern_name\&quot; -o \&quot;\$output_path\&quot;
        else
            # If no title is provided, use --stream
            fabric --pattern \&quot;$pattern_name\&quot; --stream
        fi
    }
    &quot;
done
```

This will allow you to use the patterns as aliases like in the above for example `summarize` instead of `fabric --pattern summarize --stream`, however if you pass in an extra argument like this `summarize &quot;my_article_title&quot;` your output will be saved in the destination that you set in `obsidian_base=&quot;/path/to/obsidian&quot;` in the following format `YYYY-MM-DD-my_article_title.md` where the date gets autogenerated for you.
You can tweak the date format by tweaking the `date_stamp` format.

### Migration

If you have the Legacy (Python) version installed and want to migrate to the Go version, here&#039;s how you do it. It&#039;s basically two steps: 1) uninstall the Python version, and 2) install the Go version.

```bash
# Uninstall Legacy Fabric
pipx uninstall fabric

# Clear any old Fabric aliases
(check your .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
# Install the Go version
go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest
# Run setup for the new version. Important because things have changed
fabric --setup
```

Then [set your environmental variables](#environment-variables) as shown above.

### Upgrading

The great thing about Go is that it&#039;s super easy to upgrade. Just run the same command you used to install it in the first place and you&#039;ll always get the latest version.

```bash
go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest
```

### Shell Completions

Fabric provides shell completion scripts for Zsh, Bash, and Fish
shells, making it easier to use the CLI by providing tab completion
for commands and options.

#### Zsh Completion

To enable Zsh completion:

```bash
# Copy the completion file to a directory in your $fpath
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
cp completions/_fabric ~/.zsh/completions/

# Add the directory to fpath in your .zshrc before compinit
echo &#039;fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;autoload -Uz compinit &amp;&amp; compinit&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

#### Bash Completion

To enable Bash completion:

```bash
# Source the completion script in your .bashrc
echo &#039;source /path/to/fabric/completions/fabric.bash&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc

# Or copy to the system-wide bash completion directory
sudo cp completions/fabric.bash /etc/bash_completion.d/
```

#### Fish Completion

To enable Fish completion:

```bash
# Copy the completion file to the fish completions directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
cp completions/fabric.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/
```

## Usage

Once you have it all set up, here&#039;s how to use it.

```bash
fabric -h
```

```plaintext

#### JavaScript 3D library

The aim of the project is to create an easy-to-use, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose 3D library. The current builds only include WebGL and WebGPU renderers but SVG and CSS3D renderers are also available as addons.

### Usage

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
import * as THREE from &#039;three&#039;;

const width = window.innerWidth, height = window.innerHeight;

// init

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, width / height, 0.01, 10 );
camera.position.z = 1;

const scene = new THREE.Scene();

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
renderer.setSize( width, height );
renderer.setAnimationLoop( animate );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

// animation

function animate( time ) {

	mesh.rotation.x = time / 2000;
	mesh.rotation.y = time / 1000;

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}
```

If everything goes well, you should see [this](https://jsfiddle.net/v98k6oze/).

### Cloning this repository

Cloning the repo with all its history results in a ~2 GB download. If you don&#039;t need the whole history you can use the `depth` parameter to significantly reduce download size.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git
```

## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs don&#039;t even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt in Cursor:

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM&#039;s context.

- 1️⃣ Write your prompt naturally
- 2️⃣ Tell the LLM to `use context7`
- 3️⃣ Get working code answers

No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don&#039;t exist, no outdated code generations.

## 📚 Adding Projects

Check out our [project addition guide](./docs/adding-projects.md) to learn how to add (or update) your favorite libraries to Context7.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js &gt;= v18.0.0
- Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop or another MCP Client

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Installing via Smithery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

To install Context7 MCP Server for any client automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@upstash/context7-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @upstash/context7-mcp --client &lt;CLIENT_NAME&gt; --key &lt;YOUR_SMITHERY_KEY&gt;
```

You can find your Smithery key in the [Smithery.ai webpage](https://smithery.ai/server/@upstash/context7-mcp).

You can configure Context7 MCP in Visual Studio 2022 by following the [Visual Studio MCP Servers documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers?view=vs-2022).

Add this to your Visual Studio MCP config file (see the [Visual Studio docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers?view=vs-2022) for details):

```json
{
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;servers&quot;: {
      &quot;context7&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://mcp.context7.com/mcp&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or, for a local server:

```json
{
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;servers&quot;: {
      &quot;context7&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,

        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
      },
      &quot;settings&quot;: {}
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Gemini CLI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

See [Gemini CLI Configuration](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/configuration.md) for details.

1.  Open the Gemini CLI settings file. The location is `~/.gemini/settings.json` (where `~` is your home directory).
2.  Add the following to the `mcpServers` object in your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

If the `mcpServers` object does not exist, create it.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Claude Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Run this command. See [Claude Code MCP docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp) for more info.

#### Claude Code Remote Server Connection

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
```

Or using SSE transport:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport sse context7 https://mcp.context7.com/sse
```

#### Claude Code Local Server Connection

```sh
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Claude Desktop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Add this to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json` file. See [Claude Desktop MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for more info.

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;Context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Install in Cline&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;

You can easily install Context7 through the [Cline MCP Server Marketplace](https://cline.bot/mcp-marketplace) by following these instructions:

1. Open **Cline**.
1. Click the hamburger menu icon (☰) to enter the **MCP Servers** section.
2. Use the search bar within the **Marketplace** tab to find *Context7*.
3. Click the **Install** button.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in BoltAI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Open the &quot;Settings&quot; page of the app, navigate to &quot;Plugins,&quot; and enter the following JSON:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;context7&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

Once saved, enter in the chat `get-library-docs` followed by your Context7 documentation ID (e.g., `get-library-docs /nuxt/ui`). More information is available on [BoltAI&#039;s Documentation site](https://docs.boltai.com/docs/plugins/mcp-servers). For BoltAI on iOS, [see this guide](https://docs.boltai.com/docs/boltai-mobile/mcp-servers).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using Docker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

If you prefer to run the MCP server in a Docker container:

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   First, create a `Dockerfile` in the project root (or anywhere you prefer):

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Click to see Dockerfile content&lt;/summary&gt;

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine

   WORKDIR /app

   # Install the latest version globally
   RUN npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp

   # Expose default port if needed (optional, depends on MCP client interaction)
   # EXPOSE 3000

   # Default command to run the server
   CMD [&quot;context7-mcp&quot;]
   ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   Then, build the image using a tag (e.g., `context7-mcp`). **Make sure Docker Desktop (or the Docker daemon) is running.** Run the following command in the same directory where you saved the `Dockerfile`:

   ```bash
   docker build -t context7-mcp .
   ```

2. **Configure Your MCP Client:**

   Update your MCP client&#039;s configuration to use the Docker command.

   _Example for a cline_mcp_settings.json:_

   ```json
   {
     &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
       &quot;Сontext7&quot;: {
         &quot;autoApprove&quot;: [],
         &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
         &quot;timeout&quot;: 60,
         &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
         &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;run&quot;, &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;--rm&quot;, &quot;context7-mcp&quot;],
         &quot;transportType&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   _Note: This is an example configuration. Please refer to the specific examples for your MCP client (like Cursor, VS Code, etc.) earlier in this README to adapt the structure (e.g., `mcpServers` vs `servers`). Also, ensure the image name in `args` matches the tag used during the `docker build` command._

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Windows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The configuration on Windows is slightly different compared to Linux or macOS (_`Cline` is used in the example_). The same principle applies to other editors; refer to the configuration of `command` and `args`.

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;github.com/upstash/context7-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;cmd&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/c&quot;, &quot;npx&quot;, &quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp@latest&quot;],
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;autoApprove&quot;: []
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Augment Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

To configure Context7 MCP in Augment Code, you can use either the graphical interface or manual configuration.

### **A. Using the Augment Code UI**

1. Click the hamburger menu.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Navigate to the **Tools** section.
4. Click the **+ Add MCP** button.
5. Enter the following command:

   ```
   npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
   ```

6. Name the MCP: **Context7**.
7. Click the **Add** button.

Once the MCP server is added, you can start using Context7&#039;s up-to-date code documentation features directly within Augment Code.

---

### **B. Manual Configuration**

1. Press Cmd/Ctrl Shift P or go to the hamburger menu in the Augment panel
2. Select Edit Settings
3. Under Advanced, click Edit in settings.json
4. Add the server configuration to the `mcpServers` array in the `augment.advanced` object

&quot;augment.advanced&quot;: {
&quot;mcpServers&quot;: [
{
&quot;name&quot;: &quot;context7&quot;,
&quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
&quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@upstash/context7-mcp&quot;]
}
]
}

Once the MCP server is added, restart your editor. If you receive any errors, check the syntax to make sure closing brackets or commas are not missing.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Roo Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

## 🔨 Available Tools

Context7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:

- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.

  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for

- `get-library-docs`: Fetches documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `context7CompatibleLibraryID` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)
  - `topic` (optional): Focus the docs on a specific topic (e.g., &quot;routing&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;)
  - `tokens` (optional, default 10000): Max number of tokens to return. Values less than the default value of 10000 are automatically increased to 10000.

## 🛟 Tips

### Add a Rule
&gt; If you don’t want to add `use context7` to every prompt, you can define a simple rule in your `.windsurfrules` file in Windsurf or from `Cursor Settings &gt; Rules` section in Cursor (or the equivalent in your MCP client) to auto-invoke Context7 on any code question:
&gt; ```toml
&gt; [[calls]]
&gt; match = &quot;when the user requests code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation&quot;
&gt; tool  = &quot;context7&quot;
&gt; ```
&gt; From then on you’ll get Context7’s docs in any related conversation without typing anything extra. You can add your use cases to the match part.

### Use Library Id
&gt; If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That way, Context7 MCP server can skip the library-matching step and directly continue with retrieving docs.
&gt; ```txt
&gt; implement basic authentication with supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for api and docs
&gt; ```
&gt; The slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?)](https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching/pulls)

LearnGitBranching is a git repository visualizer, sandbox, and a series of educational tutorials and challenges. Its primary purpose is to help developers understand git through the power of visualization (something that&#039;s absent when working on the command line). This is achieved through a game with different levels to get acquainted with the different git commands.

You can input a variety of commands into LearnGitBranching (LGB) -- as commands are processed, the nearby commit tree will dynamically update to reflect the effects of each command:

![demo-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6324814/108740487-02c3c400-7536-11eb-9dd1-53275cdf76fb.gif)

This visualization combined with tutorials and &quot;levels&quot; can help both beginners and intermediate developers polish their version control skills. A quick demo is available here:
https://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?demo

Or, you can launch the application normally here:
https://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/

### Sandbox Mode

By default the application launches in &quot;sandbox mode&quot; with a basic repository already created. Here you can enter commands and mess around with a repository as much as you like. Keep in mind you can

* `undo` to undo the effects of the last command
* `reset` to start over with a clean slate (works in levels too)
* `git clone` to simulate remote repositories!

Sandbox mode can be great for demonstrating something to a friend, but the real learning is with levels...

## Levels

Type `levels` to see the available lessons / challenges (and which ones you have solved so far). Each level series aims to teach some high-level git concept, and each tab of levels separates major worlds of info (like remote repositories versus local).

For some added fun, there is a &quot;git golf&quot; concept where we keep track of how many commands you use to solve each level. See if you can match all of our records!

### Sharing permalinks

You can share a link to LearnGitBranching with an arbitrary set of commands that will execute upon load by using the `command` URL parameter. You will also likely want to disable the intro dialog for this case with the `NODEMO` url param; here is [an example](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?NODEMO&amp;command=echo%20%22hello%22;%20git%20commit) to get started.

### Level Builder

You can build levels with the `build level` command. A dialog will walk you through the process, and at the end it will show you a JSON blob that represents the level you just created. Paste that in a [gist](https://gist.github.com) or directly into an issue and I can check it out / merge in your changes! You can also share this level directly with friends by having them run `import level` and paste the JSON in the resulting text field, or simply send them a custom URL with the the gist ID in the parameters, like so:
https://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?gist_level_id=a84407351f9c9f0cb241

## Reporting Bugs / Opening Issues

When reporting bugs, try running the command `debug_copyTree()` in your JS console when in a state just before reproducing a bug. This can avoid having to copy all the commands you used to get into a specific state. (I can then use the `importTreeNow` command to get to that exact state)

## Building yourself / Contributing Functionality

For contributing core functionality in the app, you&#039;ll probably want to test your changes
at least once before submitting a pull request. That means you&#039;ll need the &quot;gulp.js&quot; build tool to build the app:

https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start

You&#039;ll also need `yarn` to download all the dependencies of the project.

The general workflow / steps are below:

```bash
git clone &lt;your fork of the repo&gt;
cd learnGitBranching
yarn install

git checkout -b newAwesomeFeature
vim ./src/js/git/index.js # some changes
yarn gulp fastBuild # skips tests and linting, faster build

# after building you can open up your browser to the index.html
open ./index.html
# file generated and see your changes

vim ./src/js/git/index.js # more changes
yarn gulp build # runs tests and lint

git commit -am &quot;My new sweet feature!&quot;
git push
# go online and request a pull
```

Alternatively, you can also build and run the app in a pre-configured online workspace:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching/blob/main/src/js/git/index.js)
[![Open in Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/img/open-in-codeanywhere-btn.svg)](https://app.codeanywhere.com/#https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching)


## Other Technical Details

LearnGitBranching is a pretty simple application (from a technical perspective). There&#039;s no backend database or any AJAX requests -- it&#039;s a 100% clientside application written in JavaScript. The production version (on github.io) literally just serves up an HTML page with some JS and CSS.

Here is the high-level process of the build:

* CSS is written into just one stylesheet (there is not a whole ton of styling)
* New HTML is written into a template HTML file (`template.index.html`). This is only needed
  for new views
* The app is &quot;built&quot;, which outputs:
  * `index.html` in the root directory
  * CSS and JS files in `./build` directory
* If the app is being built for production, then these CSS and JS files
  are hashed (to bust caches) and tests are run
* That&#039;s it!

Thus, if you build the app locally, all you have to do in order to run the app is just open up `index.html` in the root directory of the repo. Pretty simple

### Docker

You can run the most recently built stable image with `docker run -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/pcottle/learngitbranching:main`. Access your environment with at [http://localhost:8080/](&lt;http://localhost:8080/&gt;)

You can build the app and image with the command: `docker build -t ghcr.io/pcottle/learngitbranching:latest`. See the [Makefile](Makefile) for information on how to build locally with docker.

## Types

  &lt;a name=&quot;types--primitives&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [1.1](#types--primitives) **Primitives**: When you access a primitive type you work directly on its value.

    - `string`
    - `number`
    - `boolean`
    - `null`
    - `undefined`
    - `symbol`
    - `bigint`

    &lt;br /&gt;

    ```javascript
    const foo = 1;
    let bar = foo;

    bar = 9;

    console.log(foo, bar); // =&gt; 1, 9
    ```

    - Symbols and BigInts cannot be faithfully polyfilled, so they should not be used when targeting browsers/environments that don’t support them natively.

  &lt;a name=&quot;types--complex&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [1.2](#types--complex)  **Complex**: When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.

    - `object`
    - `array`
    - `function`

    &lt;br /&gt;

    ```javascript
    const foo = [1, 2];
    const bar = foo;

    bar[0] = 9;

    console.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // =&gt; 9, 9
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## References

  &lt;a name=&quot;references--prefer-const&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [2.1](#references--prefer-const) Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`. eslint: [`prefer-const`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const), [`no-const-assign`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-const-assign)

    &gt; Why? This ensures that you can’t reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;

    // good
    const a = 1;
    const b = 2;
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;references--disallow-var&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [2.2](#references--disallow-var) If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`. eslint: [`no-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var)

    &gt; Why? `let` is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like `var`.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    var count = 1;
    if (true) {
      count += 1;
    }

    // good, use the let.
    let count = 1;
    if (true) {
      count += 1;
    }
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;references--block-scope&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [2.3](#references--block-scope) Note that both `let` and `const` are block-scoped, whereas `var` is function-scoped.

    ```javascript
    // const and let only exist in the blocks they are defined in.
    {
      let a = 1;
      const b = 1;
      var c = 1;
    }
    console.log(a); // ReferenceError
    console.log(b); // ReferenceError
    console.log(c); // Prints 1
    ```

    In the above code, you can see that referencing `a` and `b` will produce a ReferenceError, while `c` contains the number. This is because `a` and `b` are block scoped, while `c` is scoped to the containing function.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Objects

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--no-new&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.1](#objects--no-new) Use the literal syntax for object creation. eslint: [`no-new-object`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new-object)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const item = new Object();

    // good
    const item = {};
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-computed-properties&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.2](#es6-computed-properties) Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names.

    &gt; Why? They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place.

    ```javascript

    function getKey(k) {
      return `a key named ${k}`;
    }

    // bad
    const obj = {
      id: 5,
      name: &#039;San Francisco&#039;,
    };
    obj[getKey(&#039;enabled&#039;)] = true;

    // good
    const obj = {
      id: 5,
      name: &#039;San Francisco&#039;,
      [getKey(&#039;enabled&#039;)]: true,
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-object-shorthand&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.3](#es6-object-shorthand) Use object method shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const atom = {
      value: 1,

      addValue: function (value) {
        return atom.value + value;
      },
    };

    // good
    const atom = {
      value: 1,

      addValue(value) {
        return atom.value + value;
      },
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-object-concise&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.4](#es6-object-concise) Use property value shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand)

    &gt; Why? It is shorter and descriptive.

    ```javascript
    const lukeSkywalker = &#039;Luke Skywalker&#039;;

    // bad
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker: lukeSkywalker,
    };

    // good
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker,
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--grouped-shorthand&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.5](#objects--grouped-shorthand) Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration.

    &gt; Why? It’s easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand.

    ```javascript
    const anakinSkywalker = &#039;Anakin Skywalker&#039;;
    const lukeSkywalker = &#039;Luke Skywalker&#039;;

    // bad
    const obj = {
      episodeOne: 1,
      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,
      lukeSkywalker,
      episodeThree: 3,
      mayTheFourth: 4,
      anakinSkywalker,
    };

    // good
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker,
      anakinSkywalker,
      episodeOne: 1,
      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,
      episodeThree: 3,
      mayTheFourth: 4,
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--quoted-props&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3.8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.6](#objects--quoted-props) Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. eslint: [`quote-props`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quote-props)

    &gt; Why? In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const bad = {
      &#039;foo&#039;: 3,
      &#039;bar&#039;: 4,
      &#039;data-blah&#039;: 5,
    };

    // good
    const good = {
      foo: 3,
      bar: 4,
      &#039;data-blah&#039;: 5,
    };
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--prototype-builtins&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.7](#objects--prototype-builtins) Do not call `Object.prototype` methods directly, such as `hasOwnProperty`, `propertyIsEnumerable`, and `isPrototypeOf`. eslint: [`no-prototype-builtins`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-prototype-builtins)

    &gt; Why? These methods may be shadowed by properties on the object in question - consider `{ hasOwnProperty: false }` - or, the object may be a null object (`Object.create(null)`). In modern browsers that support ES2022, or with a polyfill such as &lt;https://npmjs.com/object.hasown&gt;, `Object.hasOwn` can also be used as an alternative to `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    console.log(object.hasOwnProperty(key));

    // good
    console.log(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key));

    // better
    const has = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty; // cache the lookup once, in module scope.
    console.log(has.call(object, key));

    // best
    console.log(Object.hasOwn(object, key)); // only supported in browsers that support ES2022

    /* or */
    import has from &#039;has&#039;; // https://www.npmjs.com/package/has
    console.log(has(object, key));
    /* or */
    console.log(Object.hasOwn(object, key)); // https://www.npmjs.com/package/object.hasown
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;objects--rest-spread&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [3.8](#objects--rest-spread) Prefer the object spread syntax over [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) to shallow-copy objects. Use the object rest parameter syntax to get a new object with certain properties omitted. eslint: [`prefer-object-spread`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-object-spread)

    ```javascript
    // very bad
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = Object.assign(original, { c: 3 }); // this mutates `original` ಠ_ಠ
    delete copy.a; // so does this

    // bad
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = Object.assign({}, original, { c: 3 }); // copy =&gt; { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

    // good
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = { ...original, c: 3 }; // copy =&gt; { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

    const { a, ...noA } = copy; // noA =&gt; { b: 2, c: 3 }
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Arrays

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--literals&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.1](#arrays--literals) Use the literal syntax for array creation. eslint: [`no-array-constructor`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-array-constructor)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const items = new Array();

    // good
    const items = [];
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--push&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.2](#arrays--push) Use [Array#push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.

    ```javascript
    const someStack = [];

    // bad
    someStack[someStack.length] = &#039;abracadabra&#039;;

    // good
    someStack.push(&#039;abracadabra&#039;);
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-array-spreads&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.3](#es6-array-spreads) Use array spreads `...` to copy arrays.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const len = items.length;
    const itemsCopy = [];
    let i;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i += 1) {
      itemsCopy[i] = items[i];
    }

    // good
    const itemsCopy = [...items];
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--from&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--from-iterable&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.4](#arrays--from-iterable) To convert an iterable object to an array, use spreads `...` instead of [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from)

    ```javascript
    const foo = document.querySelectorAll(&#039;.foo&#039;);

    // good
    const nodes = Array.from(foo);

    // best
    const nodes = [...foo];
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--from-array-like&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.5](#arrays--from-array-like) Use [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) for converting an array-like object to an array.

    ```javascript
    const arrLike = { 0: &#039;foo&#039;, 1: &#039;bar&#039;, 2: &#039;baz&#039;, length: 3 };

    // bad
    const arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(arrLike);

    // good
    const arr = Array.from(arrLike);
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--mapping&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.6](#arrays--mapping) Use [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) instead of spread `...` for mapping over iterables, because it avoids creating an intermediate array.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const baz = [...foo].map(bar);

    // good
    const baz = Array.from(foo, bar);
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--callback-return&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.7](#arrays--callback-return) Use return statements in array method callbacks. It’s ok to omit the return if the function body consists of a single statement returning an expression without side effects, following [8.2](#arrows--implicit-return). eslint: [`array-callback-return`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/array-callback-return)

    ```javascript
    // good
    [1, 2, 3].map((x) =&gt; {
      const y = x + 1;
      return x * y;
    });

    // good
    [1, 2, 3].map((x) =&gt; x + 1);

    // bad - no returned value means `acc` becomes undefined after the first iteration
    [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((acc, item, index) =&gt; {
      const flatten = acc.concat(item);
    });

    // good
    [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((acc, item, index) =&gt; {
      const flatten = acc.concat(item);
      return flatten;
    });

    // bad
    inbox.filter((msg) =&gt; {
      const { subject, author } = msg;
      if (subject === &#039;Mockingbird&#039;) {
        return author === &#039;Harper Lee&#039;;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    });

    // good
    inbox.filter((msg) =&gt; {
      const { subject, author } = msg;
      if (subject === &#039;Mockingbird&#039;) {
        return author === &#039;Harper Lee&#039;;
      }

      return false;
    });
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;arrays--bracket-newline&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [4.8](#arrays--bracket-newline) Use line breaks after opening array brackets and before closing array brackets, if an array has multiple lines

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const arr = [
      [0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5],
    ];

    const objectInArray = [{
      id: 1,
    }, {
      id: 2,
    }];

    const numberInArray = [
      1, 2,
    ];

    // good
    const arr = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]];

    const objectInArray = [
      {
        id: 1,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
      },
    ];

    const numberInArray = [
      1,
      2,
    ];
    ```

## Destructuring

  &lt;a name=&quot;destructuring--object&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [5.1](#destructuring--object) Use object destructuring when accessing and using multiple properties of an object. eslint: [`prefer-destructuring`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)

    &gt; Why? Destructuring saves you from creating temporary references for those properties, and from repetitive access of the object. Repeating object access creates more repetitive code, requires more reading, and creates more opportunities for mistakes. Destructuring objects also provides a single site of definition of the object structure that is used in the block, rather than requiring reading the entire block to determine what is used.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function getFullName(user) {
      const firstName = user.firstName;
      const lastName = user.lastName;

      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }

    // good
    function getFullName(user) {
      const { firstName, lastName } = user;
      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }

    // best
    function getFullName({ firstName, lastName }) {
      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;destructuring--array&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [5.2](#destructuring--array) Use array destructuring. eslint: [`prefer-destructuring`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)

    ```javascript
    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

    // bad
    const first = arr[0];
    const second = arr[1];

    // good
    const [first, second] = arr;
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;destructuring--object-over-array&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [5.3](#destructuring--object-over-array) Use object destructuring for multiple return values, not array destructuring.

    &gt; Why? You can add new properties over time or change the order of things without breaking call sites.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function processInput(input) {
      // then a miracle occurs
      return [left, right, top, bottom];
    }

    // the caller needs to think about the order of return data
    const [left, __, top] = processInput(input);

    // good
    function processInput(input) {
      // then a miracle occurs
      return { left, right, top, bottom };
    }

    // the caller selects only the data they need
    const { left, top } = processInput(input);
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Strings

  &lt;a name=&quot;strings--quotes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.1](#strings--quotes) Use single quotes `&#039;&#039;` for strings. eslint: [`quotes`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quotes)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const name = &quot;Capt. Janeway&quot;;

    // bad - template literals should contain interpolation or newlines
    const name = `Capt. Janeway`;

    // good
    const name = &#039;Capt. Janeway&#039;;
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;strings--line-length&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.2](#strings--line-length) Strings that cause the line to go over 100 characters should not be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.

    &gt; Why? Broken strings are painful to work with and make code less searchable.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const errorMessage = &#039;This is a super long error that was thrown because \
    of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do \
    with this, you would get nowhere \
    fast.&#039;;

    // bad
    const errorMessage = &#039;This is a super long error that was thrown because &#039; +
      &#039;of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do &#039; +
      &#039;with this, you would get nowhere fast.&#039;;

    // good
    const errorMessage = &#039;This is a super long error that was thrown because of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do with this, you would get nowhere fast.&#039;;
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;es6-template-literals&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6.4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.3](#es6-template-literals) When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation. eslint: [`prefer-template`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-template) [`template-curly-spacing`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/template-curly-spacing)

    &gt; Why? Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return &#039;How are you, &#039; + name + &#039;?&#039;;
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return [&#039;How are you, &#039;, name, &#039;?&#039;].join();
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${ name }?`;
    }

    // good
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${name}?`;
    }
    ```

  &lt;a name=&quot;strings--eval&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.4](#strings--eval) Never use `eval()` on a string; it opens too many vulnerabilities. eslint: [`no-eval`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-eval)

  &lt;a name=&quot;strings--escaping&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  - [6.5](#strings--escaping) Do not unnecessarily escape characters in strings. eslint: [`no-useless-esca

## Demos

You can try Plyr in Codepen using our minimal templates: [HTML5 video](https://codepen.io/pen?template=bKeqpr), [HTML5 audio](https://codepen.io/pen?template=rKLywR), [YouTube](https://codepen.io/pen?template=GGqbbJ), [Vimeo](https://codepen.io/pen?template=bKeXNq). For Streaming we also have example integrations with: [Dash.js](https://codepen.io/pen?template=GRoogML), [Hls.js](https://codepen.io/pen?template=oyLKQb) and [Shaka Player](https://codepen.io/pen?template=ZRpzZO)

# Quick setup

## HTML

Plyr extends upon the standard [HTML5 media element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) markup so that&#039;s all you need for those types.

### HTML5 Video

```html
&lt;video id=&quot;player&quot; playsinline controls data-poster=&quot;/path/to/poster.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/video.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/video.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;!-- Captions are optional --&gt;
  &lt;track kind=&quot;captions&quot; label=&quot;English captions&quot; src=&quot;/path/to/captions.vtt&quot; srclang=&quot;en&quot; default /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
```

**Note**: The poster image should be specified using `data-poster`. This is to prevent it [being downloaded twice](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1531). If you&#039;re sure the image will be cached, you can still use the `poster` attribute for true progressive enhancement.

### HTML5 Audio

```html
&lt;audio id=&quot;player&quot; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/audio.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mp3&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/path/to/audio.ogg&quot; type=&quot;audio/ogg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
```

For YouTube and Vimeo players, Plyr uses progressive enhancement to enhance the default `&lt;iframe&gt;` embeds. Below are some examples. The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the embed responsive. You can add the `autoplay`, `loop`, `hl` (YouTube only) and `playsinline` (YouTube only) query parameters to the URL and they will be set as config options automatically. For YouTube, the `origin` should be updated to reflect the domain you&#039;re hosting the embed on, or you can opt to omit it.

### YouTube

We recommend [progressive enhancement](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) with the embedded players. You can elect to use an `&lt;iframe&gt;` as the source element (which Plyr will progressively enhance) or a bog standard `&lt;div&gt;` with two essential data attributes - `data-plyr-provider` and `data-plyr-embed-id`.

```html
&lt;div class=&quot;plyr__video-embed&quot; id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe
    src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTqVqk7FSmY?origin=https://plyr.io&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;playsinline=1&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot;
    allowfullscreen
    allowtransparency
    allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

_Note_: The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the player a responsive 16:9 (most common) iframe embed. When plyr itself kicks in, your custom `ratio` config option will be used.

Or the `&lt;div&gt;` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot; data-plyr-provider=&quot;youtube&quot; data-plyr-embed-id=&quot;bTqVqk7FSmY&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

_Note_: The `data-plyr-embed-id` can either be the video ID or URL for the media.

### Vimeo

Much the same as YouTube above.

```html
&lt;div class=&quot;plyr__video-embed&quot; id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe
    src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?loop=false&amp;amp;byline=false&amp;amp;portrait=false&amp;amp;title=false&amp;amp;speed=true&amp;amp;transparent=0&amp;amp;gesture=media&quot;
    allowfullscreen
    allowtransparency
    allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

Or the `&lt;div&gt;` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot; data-plyr-provider=&quot;vimeo&quot; data-plyr-embed-id=&quot;76979871&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

## JavaScript

You can use Plyr as an ES6 module as follows:

```js
import Plyr from &#039;plyr&#039;;

const player = new Plyr(&#039;#player&#039;);
```

Alternatively you can include the `plyr.js` script before the closing `&lt;/body&gt;` tag and then in your JS create a new instance of Plyr as below.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/plyr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const player = new Plyr(&#039;#player&#039;);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

See [initialising](#initializing) for more information on advanced setups.

You can use our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) for the JavaScript. There&#039;s 2 versions; one with and one without [polyfills](#polyfills). My recommendation would be to manage polyfills separately as part of your application but to make life easier you can use the polyfilled build.

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

...or...

```html
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.polyfilled.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## CSS

Include the `plyr.css` stylesheet into your `&lt;head&gt;`.

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;path/to/plyr.css&quot; /&gt;
```

If you want to use our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) for the default CSS, you can use the following:

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.css&quot; /&gt;
```

## SVG Sprite

The SVG sprite is loaded automatically from our CDN (provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)). To change this, see the [options](#options) below. For
reference, the CDN hosted SVG sprite can be found at `https://cdn.plyr.io/3.7.8/plyr.svg`.

### Self hosting

If you don&#039;t want to create a build system to include Plyr as an npm module, you can use the pre-built files. You have a few options:

- Download the files from the CDN links above, they&#039;re already minified.
- Download the files from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/plyr/dist/) or similar services.
- Build the project yourself using `npm i &amp;&amp; npm run build`, which installs the dependencies and spits out a build to `dist`.

# Ads

Plyr has partnered up with [vi.ai](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio) to offer monetization options for your videos. Getting setup is easy:

- [Sign up for a vi.ai account](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio)
- Grab your publisher ID from the code snippet
- Enable ads in the [config options](#options) and enter your publisher ID

Any questions regarding the ads can be sent straight to vi.ai and any issues with rendering raised through GitHub issues.

If you do not wish to use Vi, you can set your own `ads.tagUrl` [option](#options).

# Advanced

## Customizing the CSS

If you want to change any design tokens used for the rendering of the player, you can do so using [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

Here&#039;s a list of the properties and what they are used for:

| Name                                           | Description                                                                                             | Default / Fallback                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--plyr-color-main`                            | The primary UI color.                                                                                   | ![#f03c15](https://place-hold.it/15/00b3ff/000000?text=+) `#00b3ff`   |
| `--plyr-video-background`                      | The background color of video and poster wrappers for using alpha channel videos and poster images.     | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)`                                                    |
| `--plyr-focus-visible-color`                   | The color used for the focus styles when an element is `:focus-visible` (keyboard focused).             | `--plyr-color-main`                                                   |

            <h2>README</h2><pre># ws: a Node.js WebSocket library

[![Version npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ws.svg?logo=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws)
[![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/websockets/ws/ci.yml?branch=master&amp;label=CI&amp;logo=github)](https://github.com/websockets/ws/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/websockets/ws/master.svg?logo=coveralls)](https://coveralls.io/github/websockets/ws)

ws is a simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client and
server implementation.

Passes the quite extensive Autobahn test suite: [server][server-report],
[client][client-report].

**Note**: This module does not work in the browser. The client in the docs is a
reference to a backend with the role of a client in the WebSocket communication.
Browser clients must use the native
[`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)
object. To make the same code work seamlessly on Node.js and the browser, you
can use one of the many wrappers available on npm, like
[isomorphic-ws](https://github.com/heineiuo/isomorphic-ws).

## Protocol support

- **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`)
- **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option
  `protocolVersion: 13`)

## Installing

```
npm install ws
```

### Opt-in for performance

[bufferutil][] is an optional module that can be installed alongside the ws
module:

```
npm install --save-optional bufferutil
```

This is a binary addon that improves the performance of certain operations such
as masking and unmasking the data payload of the WebSocket frames. Prebuilt
binaries are available for the most popular platforms, so you don&#039;t necessarily
need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine.

To force ws to not use bufferutil, use the
[`WS_NO_BUFFER_UTIL`](./doc/ws.md#ws_no_buffer_util) environment variable. This
can be useful to enhance security in systems where a user can put a package in
the package search path of an application of another user, due to how the
Node.js resolver algorithm works.

#### Legacy opt-in for performance

If you are running on an old version of Node.js (prior to v18.14.0), ws also
supports the [utf-8-validate][] module:

```
npm install --save-optional utf-8-validate
```

This contains a binary polyfill for [`buffer.isUtf8()`][].

To force ws not to use utf-8-validate, use the
[`WS_NO_UTF_8_VALIDATE`](./doc/ws.md#ws_no_utf_8_validate) environment variable.

## API docs

See [`/doc/ws.md`](./doc/ws.md) for Node.js-like documentation of ws classes and
utility functions.

## WebSocket compression

ws supports the [permessage-deflate extension][permessage-deflate] which enables
the client and server to negotiate a compression algorithm and its parameters,
and then selectively apply it to the data payloads of each WebSocket message.

The extension is disabled by default on the server and enabled by default on the
client. It adds a significant overhead in terms of performance and memory
consumption so we suggest to enable it only if it is really needed.

Note that Node.js has a variety of issues with high-performance compression,
where increased concurrency, especially on Linux, can lead to [catastrophic
memory fragmentation][node-zlib-bug] and slow performance. If you intend to use
permessage-deflate in production, it is worthwhile to set up a test
representative of your workload and ensure Node.js/zlib will handle it with
acceptable performance and memory usage.

Tuning of permessage-deflate can be done via the options defined below. You can
also use `zlibDeflateOptions` and `zlibInflateOptions`, which is passed directly
into the creation of [raw deflate/inflate streams][node-zlib-deflaterawdocs].

See [the docs][ws-server-options] for more options.

```js
import WebSocket, { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

const wss = new WebSocketServer({
  port: 8080,
  perMessageDeflate: {
    zlibDeflateOptions: {
      // See zlib defaults.
      chunkSize: 1024,
      memLevel: 7,
      level: 3
    },
    zlibInflateOptions: {
      chunkSize: 10 * 1024
    },
    // Other options settable:
    clientNoContextTakeover: true, // Defaults to negotiated value.
    serverNoContextTakeover: true, // Defaults to negotiated value.
    serverMaxWindowBits: 10, // Defaults to negotiated value.
    // Below options specified as default values.
    concurrencyLimit: 10, // Limits zlib concurrency for perf.
    threshold: 1024 // Size (in bytes) below which messages
    // should not be compressed if context takeover is disabled.
  }
});
```

The client will only use the extension if it is supported and enabled on the
server. To always disable the extension on the client, set the
`perMessageDeflate` option to `false`.

```js
import WebSocket from &#039;ws&#039;;

const ws = new WebSocket(&#039;ws://www.host.com/path&#039;, {
  perMessageDeflate: false
});
```

## Usage examples

### Sending and receiving text data

```js
import WebSocket from &#039;ws&#039;;

const ws = new WebSocket(&#039;ws://www.host.com/path&#039;);

ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

ws.on(&#039;open&#039;, function open() {
  ws.send(&#039;something&#039;);
});

ws.on(&#039;message&#039;, function message(data) {
  console.log(&#039;received: %s&#039;, data);
});
```

### Sending binary data

```js
import WebSocket from &#039;ws&#039;;

const ws = new WebSocket(&#039;ws://www.host.com/path&#039;);

ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

ws.on(&#039;open&#039;, function open() {
  const array = new Float32Array(5);

  for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; ++i) {
    array[i] = i / 2;
  }

  ws.send(array);
});
```

### Simple server

```js
import { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws) {
  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

  ws.on(&#039;message&#039;, function message(data) {
    console.log(&#039;received: %s&#039;, data);
  });

  ws.send(&#039;something&#039;);
});
```

### External HTTP/S server

```js
import { createServer } from &#039;https&#039;;
import { readFileSync } from &#039;fs&#039;;
import { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

const server = createServer({
  cert: readFileSync(&#039;/path/to/cert.pem&#039;),
  key: readFileSync(&#039;/path/to/key.pem&#039;)
});
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server });

wss.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws) {
  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

  ws.on(&#039;message&#039;, function message(data) {
    console.log(&#039;received: %s&#039;, data);
  });

  ws.send(&#039;something&#039;);
});

server.listen(8080);
```

### Multiple servers sharing a single HTTP/S server

```js
import { createServer } from &#039;http&#039;;
import { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

const server = createServer();
const wss1 = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true });
const wss2 = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true });

wss1.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws) {
  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

  // ...
});

wss2.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws) {
  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

  // ...
});

server.on(&#039;upgrade&#039;, function upgrade(request, socket, head) {
  const { pathname } = new URL(request.url, &#039;wss://base.url&#039;);

  if (pathname === &#039;/foo&#039;) {
    wss1.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, function done(ws) {
      wss1.emit(&#039;connection&#039;, ws, request);
    });
  } else if (pathname === &#039;/bar&#039;) {
    wss2.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, function done(ws) {
      wss2.emit(&#039;connection&#039;, ws, request);
    });
  } else {
    socket.destroy();
  }
});

server.listen(8080);
```

### Client authentication

```js
import { createServer } from &#039;http&#039;;
import { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

function onSocketError(err) {
  console.error(err);
}

const server = createServer();
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true });

wss.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws, request, client) {
  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

  ws.on(&#039;message&#039;, function message(data) {
    console.log(`Received message ${data} from user ${client}`);
  });
});

server.on(&#039;upgrade&#039;, function upgrade(request, socket, head) {
  socket.on(&#039;error&#039;, onSocketError);

  // This function is not defined on purpose. Implement it with your own logic.
  authenticate(request, function next(err, client) {
    if (err || !client) {
      socket.write(&#039;HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\n\r\n&#039;);
      socket.destroy();
      return;
    }

    socket.removeListener(&#039;error&#039;, onSocketError);

    wss.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, function done(ws) {
      wss.emit(&#039;connection&#039;, ws, request, client);
    });
  });
});

server.listen(8080);
```

Also see the provided [example][session-parse-example] using `express-session`.

### Server broadcast

A client WebSocket broadcasting to all connected WebSocket clients, including
itself.

```js
import WebSocket, { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws) {
  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

  ws.on(&#039;message&#039;, function message(data, isBinary) {
    wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(data, { binary: isBinary });
      }
    });
  });
});
```

A client WebSocket broadcasting to every other connected WebSocket clients,
excluding itself.

```js
import WebSocket, { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws) {
  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

  ws.on(&#039;message&#039;, function message(data, isBinary) {
    wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {
      if (client !== ws &amp;&amp; client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(data, { binary: isBinary });
      }
    });
  });
});
```

### Round-trip time

```js
import WebSocket from &#039;ws&#039;;

const ws = new WebSocket(&#039;wss://websocket-echo.com/&#039;);

ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

ws.on(&#039;open&#039;, function open() {
  console.log(&#039;connected&#039;);
  ws.send(Date.now());
});

ws.on(&#039;close&#039;, function close() {
  console.log(&#039;disconnected&#039;);
});

ws.on(&#039;message&#039;, function message(data) {
  console.log(`Round-trip time: ${Date.now() - data} ms`);

  setTimeout(function timeout() {
    ws.send(Date.now());
  }, 500);
});
```

### Use the Node.js streams API

```js
import WebSocket, { createWebSocketStream } from &#039;ws&#039;;

const ws = new WebSocket(&#039;wss://websocket-echo.com/&#039;);

const duplex = createWebSocketStream(ws, { encoding: &#039;utf8&#039; });

duplex.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);

duplex.pipe(process.stdout);
process.stdin.pipe(duplex);
```

### Other examples

For a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the
examples folder.

Otherwise, see the test cases.

## FAQ

### How to get the IP address of the client?

The remote IP address can be obtained from the raw socket.

```js
import { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws, req) {
  const ip = req.socket.remoteAddress;

  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);
});
```

When the server runs behind a proxy like NGINX, the de-facto standard is to use
the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

```js
wss.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws, req) {
  const ip = req.headers[&#039;x-forwarded-for&#039;].split(&#039;,&#039;)[0].trim();

  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);
});
```

### How to detect and close broken connections?

Sometimes, the link between the server and the client can be interrupted in a
way that keeps both the server and the client unaware of the broken state of the
connection (e.g. when pulling the cord).

In these cases, ping messages can be used as a means to verify that the remote
endpoint is still responsive.

```js
import { WebSocketServer } from &#039;ws&#039;;

function heartbeat() {
  this.isAlive = true;
}

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on(&#039;connection&#039;, function connection(ws) {
  ws.isAlive = true;
  ws.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);
  ws.on(&#039;pong&#039;, heartbeat);
});

const interval = setInterval(function ping() {
  wss.clients.forEach(function each(ws) {
    if (ws.isAlive === false) return ws.terminate();

    ws.isAlive = false;
    ws.ping();
  });
}, 30000);

wss.on(&#039;close&#039;, function close() {
  clearInterval(interval);
});
```

Pong messages are automatically sent in response to ping messages as required by
the spec.

Just like the server example above, your clients might as well lose connection
without knowing it. You might want to add a ping listener on your clients to
prevent that. A simple implementation would be:

```js
import WebSocket from &#039;ws&#039;;

function heartbeat() {
  clearTimeout(this.pingTimeout);

  // Use `WebSocket#terminate()`, which immediately destroys the connection,
  // instead of `WebSocket#close()`, which waits for the close timer.
  // Delay should be equal to the interval at which your server
  // sends out pings plus a conservative assumption of the latency.
  this.pingTimeout = setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    this.terminate();
  }, 30000 + 1000);
}

const client = new WebSocket(&#039;wss://websocket-echo.com/&#039;);

client.on(&#039;error&#039;, console.error);
client.on(&#039;open&#039;, heartbeat);
client.on(&#039;ping&#039;, heartbeat);
client.on(&#039;close&#039;, function clear() {
  clearTimeout(this.pingTimeout);
});
```

### How to connect via a proxy?

Use a custom `http.Agent` implementation like [https-proxy-agent][] or
[socks-proxy-agent][].

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

- ESLint uses [Espree](https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/espree) for JavaScript parsing.
- ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
- ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`^18.18.0`, `^20.9.0`, or `&gt;=21.1.0`) built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)

You can install and configure ESLint using this command:

```shell
npm init @eslint/config@latest
```

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:

```shell
npx eslint yourfile.js
```

### pnpm Installation

To use ESLint with pnpm, we recommend setting up a `.npmrc` file with at least the following settings:

```text
auto-install-peers=true
node-linker=hoisted
```

This ensures that pnpm installs dependencies in a way that is more compatible with npm and is less likely to produce errors.

## Configuration

You can configure rules in your `eslint.config.js` files as in this example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from &quot;eslint/config&quot;;

export default defineConfig([
	{
		files: [&quot;**/*.js&quot;, &quot;**/*.cjs&quot;, &quot;**/*.mjs&quot;],
		rules: {
			&quot;prefer-const&quot;: &quot;warn&quot;,
			&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
		},
	},
]);
```

The names `&quot;prefer-const&quot;` and `&quot;no-constant-binary-expression&quot;` are the names of [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules) in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:

- `&quot;off&quot;` or `0` - turn the rule off
- `&quot;warn&quot;` or `1` - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn&#039;t affect exit code)
- `&quot;error&quot;` or `2` - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the [configuration docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)).

## Version Support

The ESLint team provides ongoing support for the current version and six months of limited support for the previous version. Limited support includes critical bug fixes, security issues, and compatibility issues only.

ESLint offers commercial support for both current and previous versions through our partners, [Tidelift][tidelift] and [HeroDevs][herodevs].

See [Version Support](https://eslint.org/version-support) for more details.

## Code of Conduct

ESLint adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://eslint.org/conduct).

## Filing Issues

Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you&#039;re reporting:

- [Bug Report](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/report-bugs)
- [Propose a New Rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-new-rule)
- [Proposing a Rule Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/propose-rule-change)
- [Request a Change](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/request-change)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does ESLint support JSX?

Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure)). Please note that supporting JSX syntax _is not_ the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn&#039;t recognize. We recommend using [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react) if you are using React and want React semantics.

### Does Prettier replace ESLint?

No, ESLint and Prettier have different jobs: ESLint is a linter (looking for problematic patterns) and Prettier is a code formatter. Using both tools is common, refer to [Prettier&#039;s documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install#eslint-and-other-linters) to learn how to configure them to work well with each other.

### What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?

ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5, and every year from 2015 up until the most recent stage 4 specification (the default). You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax and other settings (like global variables) through [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure).

### What about experimental features?

ESLint&#039;s parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.

In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use [@babel/eslint-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser) and [@babel/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-plugin) to use any option available in Babel.

Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the [TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/)), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our [contributing guidelines](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute). Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.

### Which Node.js versions does ESLint support?

ESLint updates the supported Node.js versions with each major release of ESLint. At that time, ESLint&#039;s supported Node.js versions are updated to be:

1. The most recent maintenance release of Node.js
1. The lowest minor version of the Node.js LTS release that includes the features the ESLint team wants to use.
1. The Node.js Current release

ESLint is also expected to work with Node.js versions released after the Node.js Current release.

Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#prerequisites) for the officially supported Node.js versions for a given ESLint release.

### Where to ask for help?

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions) or stop by our [Discord server](https://eslint.org/chat).

### Why doesn&#039;t ESLint lock dependency versions?

Lock files like `package-lock.json` are helpful for deployed applications. They ensure that dependencies are consistent between environments and across deployments.

Packages like `eslint` that get published to the npm registry do not include lock files. `npm install eslint` as a user will respect version constraints in ESLint&#039;s `package.json`. ESLint and its dependencies will be included in the user&#039;s lock file if one exists, but ESLint&#039;s own lock file would not be used.

We intentionally don&#039;t lock dependency versions so that we have the latest compatible dependency versions in development and CI that our users get when installing ESLint in a project.

The Twilio blog has a [deeper dive](https://www.twilio.com/blog/lockfiles-nodejs) to learn more.

## Releases

We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a [release issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arelease) for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.

## Security Policy

ESLint takes security seriously. We work hard to ensure that ESLint is safe for everyone and that security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly. Read the full [security policy](https://github.com/eslint/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Semantic Versioning Policy

ESLint follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it&#039;s not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we&#039;ve defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint:

- Patch release (intended to not break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer linting errors.
    - A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).
    - Improvements to documentation.
    - Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.
    - Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn&#039;t work for anyone).
- Minor release (might break your lint build)
    - A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors.
    - A new rule is created.
    - A new option to an existing rule that does not result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - A new addition to an existing rule to support a newly-added language feature (within the last 12 months) that will result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing rule is deprecated.
    - A new CLI capability is created.
    - New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).
    - A new formatter is created.
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and will result in strictly fewer linting errors (e.g., rule removals).
- Major release (likely to break your lint build)
    - `eslint:recommended` is updated and may result in new linting errors (e.g., rule additions, most rule option updates).
    - A new option to an existing rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.
    - An existing formatter is removed.
    - Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. The public API includes:
        - Rule schemas
        - Configuration schema
        - Command-line options
        - Node.js API
        - Rule, formatter, parser, plugin APIs

According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` e.g. `&quot;eslint&quot;: &quot;~3.1.0&quot;` to guarantee the results of your builds.

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you&#039;re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server&#039;s URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you&#039;re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you&#039;re not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

Look at the [Local Development Guide](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/advanced-topics/development) for instructions on setting up a local development environment.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you&#039;re experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

## What is Label Studio?

&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

## Try out Label Studio

Install Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. Also you can try [Label Studio Teams](https://app.heartex.com).

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python &gt;=3.7 &lt;=3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[&lt;img src=&quot;https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg&quot; height=&quot;30px&quot;&gt;](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you&#039;ve made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you&#039;re using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you&#039;re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

#### Run test suite
```bash
pip install -r deploy/requirements-test.txt
cd label_studio

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass)
DJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio python -m pytest -vv -n auto
```


## What you get from Label Studio

![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it&#039;s tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/templates-categories.jpg&quot; /&gt;

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).
