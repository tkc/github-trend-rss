## About
**A WhatsApp API client that operates via the WhatsApp Web browser.**

The library launches the WhatsApp Web browser app via Puppeteer, accessing its internal functions and creating a managed instance to reduce the risk of being blocked. This gives the API client nearly all WhatsApp Web features for dynamic use in a Node.js application.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn&#039;t be considered totally safe.**

## Installation

The module is available on [npm][npm] via `npm i whatsapp-web.js`!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **Node ``v18`` or higher, is required.**  
&gt; See the [Guide][guide] for quick upgrade instructions.

## Example usage

```js
const { Client } = require(&#039;whatsapp-web.js&#039;);

const client = new Client();

client.on(&#039;qr&#039;, (qr) =&gt; {
    // Generate and scan this code with your phone
    console.log(&#039;QR RECEIVED&#039;, qr);
});

client.on(&#039;ready&#039;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;Client is ready!&#039;);
});

client.on(&#039;message&#039;, msg =&gt; {
    if (msg.body == &#039;!ping&#039;) {
        msg.reply(&#039;pong&#039;);
    }
});

client.initialize();
```

## Why does it exist? 🔓

Calibre, while a fantastic tool for its age, has several problems when containerised, including its reliance on a KasmVNC server instance for the UI, which is near impossible to use on mobile and is relatively resource-heavy if you&#039;re running a small, lower power server like I am.

For many, Calibre-Web has really swooped in to save the day, offering an alternative to a containerised Calibre instance that&#039;s resource-light and with a much more modern UI to boot.

However, when compared to full-fat Calibre, it unfortunately lacks a few core features leading many to run both services in parallel, each serving to fill in where the other lacks, resulting in an often clunky, imperfect solution.

## Goal of the Project 🎯

Calibre-Web Automated aims to be an all-in-one solution, combining the modern lightweight web UI from Calibre-Web with the robust, versatile feature set of Calibre, with a slew of extra features and automations thrown in on top.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CWA allows you to keep your ebook library accessible &amp; organised and looks good while doing it&lt;/i&gt; 😎🦚&lt;/p&gt;

## 🚨 Deploying on Network Shares (NFS/SMB) 🚨

- CWA now supports network-share deployments via `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true`
  - This disables SQLite WAL on `metadata.db` and `app.db` to prevent locking issues
  - Skips recursive ownership changes that often fail on NFS/SMB
  - Switches ingest/metadata watchers to a polling-based watcher for reliability
- Network shares are still slower than local disks, but are now fully supported with this mode enabled

### Network shares and SQLite WAL mode

- CWA optimizes SQLite concurrency by enabling Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) on local disks.
- Some network filesystems (NFS/SMB) do not fully support WAL or reliable file locking, which can cause intermittent &quot;database is locked&quot; errors or corruption risks.
- If you are deploying on a network share, set the following environment variable to disable WAL:

  - `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true`

This tells CWA to avoid enabling WAL on the Calibre `metadata.db` and the `app.db` settings database. It also disables recursive ownership changes (`chown`) performed by init/maintenance scripts to avoid permission issues on network filesystems. Default is `false` (WAL enabled) for better performance on local disks.

#### File watching on network shares

- By default, CWA uses Linux `inotify` (via `inotifywait`) to detect new files in the ingest folder with minimal latency and overhead.
- On network shares (NFS/SMB), filesystem events can be unreliable or unavailable. When `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true` is set, CWA switches the ingest and metadata watcher services to a polling-based watcher that periodically scans for changes. This improves reliability on NAS/network mounts at the cost of slightly higher I/O and up to a few seconds of latency.
- On Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS), the container runs on a LinuxKit/WSL2 VM and host-mounted paths may not propagate `inotify` events reliably. CWA auto-detects Docker Desktop at startup and prefers the same polling watcher for reliability.
- Advanced: You can also force polling regardless of share mode by setting `CWA_WATCH_MODE=poll`.

### Running behind multiple proxies (Cloudflare Tunnel, reverse proxy)

- CWA uses Werkzeug&#039;s ProxyFix middleware to properly handle `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and other proxy headers.
- By default, it trusts **1 proxy** in the chain. If you have multiple proxies (e.g., Cloudflare Tunnel → nginx → CWA), set:

  - `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=2` (or the total number of proxies in your chain)

- **Why this matters**: Session protection validates requests based on the client&#039;s IP address. If ProxyFix doesn&#039;t trust enough proxies, it may see different IPs between requests, causing &quot;Session protection triggered&quot; warnings and forcing re-login.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you see frequent session protection warnings in logs, check your proxy chain depth and adjust this variable accordingly.

#### **Automatic Ingest Service** ✨
- CWA currently supports automatic ingest of 27 different popular ebook formats
- Users can configure the services behavior to ignore and/or have certain formats automatically converted to other formats in the Admin Panel

#### **Automatic Conversion Service** 🔃
- On by default though can be toggled off in the CWA Settings page, with EPUB as the default target format
  - _Available target formats include:_ **EPUB**, **MOBI**, **AZW3**, **KEPUB** &amp; **PDF**
- Upon detecting new files in the Ingest Directory, if any of the files are in formats the user has configured CWA to auto-convert to the current target format,
- The following **28 file types are currently supported:**
  - _.acsm, .azw, .azw3, .azw4, .mobi, .cbz, .cbr, .cb7, .cbc, .chm, .djvu, .docx, .epub, .fb2, .fbz, .html, .htmlz, .lit, .lrf, .odt, .pdf, .prc, .pdb, .pml, .rb, .rtf, .snb, .tcr, .txtz_
  - _Note: .acsm requires an additional Calibre plugin_

#### **Automatic Enforcement of Changes made to Covers &amp; Metadata through the Calibre-Web UI!** 👀📔
- In stock Calibre-Web, any changes made to a book&#039;s **Cover and/or Metadata** are only applied to how the book appears in the Calibre-Web UI, changing nothing in the ebook&#039;s files like you would expect
- This results in a frustrating situation for many CW users who utilise CW&#039;s Send-To-Kindle function, and are disappointed to find that the High-Quality Covers they picked out and carefully chosen Metadata they sourced are completely absent on all their other devices! UGH!
- CWA&#039;s **Automatic Cover &amp; Metadata Enforcement Feature** makes it so that **WHATEVER** you changes you make to **YOUR** books, **_are made to the books themselves_**, as well as in the Web UI, **making what you see, what you get.**

#### **Automated Back Up Service** 🔒
- Worried what will happen if something goes wrong during one of CWA&#039;s automated functions? Don&#039;t be!
- By default, the originals all files processed by CWA are stored in `/config/processed_books` though this can be toggled in the CWA Settings panel

#### **Smart Duplicate Detection System &amp; Management** 🔍
- Hybrid SQL + fuzzy matching detects duplicates missed by traditional scans
- Post-ingest checks and scheduled incremental scans
- One-click merge, batch operations, and optional auto-resolution
- Configurable matching rules, thresholds, and format awareness

#### **Automatic EPUB Fixer Service** 📧✅
- Ever had it where you&#039;re super excited to start reading your next book but for some reason, Amazon&#039;s Send-to-Kindle service just keeps rejecting it? Well no more!

- Originally developed by [innocenat](https://github.com/innocenat/kindle-epub-fix), this tool corrects the following potential issues for every EPUB processed by CWA:
  - Fixes UTF-8 encoding problem by adding UTF-8 declaration if no encoding is specified
  - Fixes hyperlink problem (result in Amazon rejecting the EPUB) when NCX table of content link to `&lt;body&gt;` with ID hash.
  - Detect invalid and/or missing language tag in metadata, and prompt user to select new language.
  - Remove stray `&lt;img&gt;` tags with no source field.
  - Resolves several EPUB compatibility issues, such as UTF-8 encoding, hyperlink problems, invalid/missing language tags, and stray image tags.
  - Repairs malformed language tags, XML declarations, and UTF-8 headers
  - Cleans invalid NCX links, broken CSS/fonts, and stray image tags
- This **ensures maximum comparability** for each EPUB file with the Amazon **Send-to-Kindle** service and for those who don&#039;t use Amazon devices, has the side benefit of cleaning up your lower quality files!
- Enabled by default, with per-run backups in `/config/processed_books`
- Bulk processing of whole library with progress tracking available in the Admin Panel

![CWA EPUB Fixer Service Web UI](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/blob/main/README_images/CWA-new-process-ui.gif?raw=true)

#### **Simple to use Multi-Format Conversion Service** 🌌
- This utility gives the user the option to either keep a copy of the original of all converted files in `/config/processed_books` or to trust the process and have CWA simply convert and replace those files (not recommended)
- Full usage details can be found [here](#the-convert-library-tool)

#### **Additional Metadata Providers** 🗃️
- Users can now make use of [isbndb.com](https://isbndb.com/)&#039;s huge database when fetching metadata for the books in their library!
- Access is being provided via [ibdb.dev](https://ibdb.dev/) thanks to a generous donation to the community by [@chad3814](https://www.github.com/chad3814)
- [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) and Kobo metadata providers are supported, alongside new LitRes support

#### **KOReader Syncing (KOSync)** 📖⚡

- **Book Identification:** Auto-generates KOReader-compatible partial MD5 checksums for all books
- **Unified Progress:** Syncs KOReader → CWA reading status → Kobo devices
- **Zero Config:** Checksums generated on startup and import, no manual setup
- **Modern Auth:** RFC 7617 HTTP Basic Auth with existing CWA accounts
- **Plugin Available:** Download from `/kosync` endpoint on your CWA instance

#### **Enhanced OAuth 2.0/OIDC Authentication** 🔐

- **Manual Override:** Full manual control over OAuth endpoints when auto-discovery isn&#039;t available
- **Field Mapping:** Configurable JWT field extraction for usernames and emails to work with any provider&#039;s token structure
- **Group-Based Roles:** Automatic admin role assignment based on OAuth provider groups
- **Testing Tools:** Built-in connection testing and validation to ensure your configuration works before going live
- **Enterprise Ready:** Support for custom scopes, multiple authentication methods, and comprehensive troubleshooting

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; **As of EmulatorJS version 4.0, this project is no longer a reverse-engineered version of the emulatorjs.com project. It is now a complete rewrite.**

&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; As of version 4.0.9 cores and minified files are no longer included in the repository. You will need to get them separately. You can get it from [releases](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS/releases) or the \* new CDN (see [this](#CDN) for more info). There is also a new version system that we will be using. (read [here](#Versioning) for more info).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Cloning the repository is no longer recommended for production use. You should use [releases](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS/releases) or the [CDN](https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/) instead.

&lt;br&gt;

### Ads

*This project has no ads.* &lt;br&gt;
*Although, the demo page currently has an ad to help fund this project.* &lt;br&gt;
*Ads on the demo page may come and go depending on how many people are* &lt;br&gt;
*funding this project.* &lt;br&gt;

*You can help fund this project on* ***[patreon]***

&lt;br&gt;

### Issues

*If something doesn&#039;t work, please consider opening an* ***[Issue]*** &lt;br&gt;
*with as many details as possible, as well as the console log.*

&lt;br&gt;

### 3rd Party Projects

EmulatorJS itself is built to be a plugin, rather than an entire website. This is why there is no docker container of this project. However, there are several projects you can use that use EmulatorJS!

Looking for projects that integrate EmulatorJS? Check out https://emulatorjs.org/docs/3rd-party

&lt;br&gt;

### Versioning

There are three different version names that you need to be aware of:

1. **stable** - This will be the most stable version of the emulator both code and cores will be tested before release. It will be updated every time a new version is released on GitHub. This is the default version on the Demo.
2. **latest** - This will contain the latest code but use the stable cores. This will be updated every time the *main* branch is updated.
3. **nightly** - This will contain the latest code and the latest cores. The cores will be updated every day, so this is considered alpha.

&lt;br&gt;

### CDN

**EmulatorJS provides a CDN** at `https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/`, allowing access to any version of the emulator.

To use it, set `EJS_pathtodata` to `https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/&lt;version&gt;/data/`, replacing `&lt;version&gt;` with `stable`, `latest`, `nightly`, or another main release.

Be sure to also update the `loader.js` path to:
`https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/&lt;version&gt;/data/loader.js`

&lt;br&gt;

### Development:

*Run a local server with:* 

1. Open a terminal in the root of the project.

2. Install the dependencies with:

   ```sh
   npm i
   ```

3. Start the minification with:

   ```sh
   node start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` to see the demo page.

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

#### Minifying

Before pushing the script files onto your production server it is recommended to minify them to save on load times as well as bandwidth.

Read the [minifying](minify/README.md) documentation for more info.

&lt;br&gt;

#### Localization

If you want to help with localization, please check out the [localization](data/localization/README.md) documentation.

&lt;br&gt;

**&gt;&gt; When reporting bugs, please specify what version you are using**

## About

draw.io is a configurable diagramming and whiteboarding application, jointly owned and developed by draw.io Ltd (previously named JGraph) and draw.io AG. We also run a production deployment at https://app.diagrams.net.

## License

The source code in this repository is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

The icon sets, stencil libraries, and diagram templates are provided under the following terms:

&gt; The icon sets and stencil libraries included in this software, and any derivatives thereof (including conversions to other formats, traced reproductions, substantially similar visual representations, or AI-generated images created using these icons as reference or training input), may not be used as software assets in, distributed for use with, or incorporated into Atlassian products or products distributed through the Atlassian marketplace or plugin ecosystem, without explicit written permission.
&gt;
&gt; This restriction does not apply to end-user diagram output (such as exported images or documents) created using this software.

Some icons are originally defined by third-party copyright holders; we have verified that all original licenses permit use in this project. Additional third-party JavaScript libraries are included, all with licenses compatible with Apache 2.0 (no GPL or AGPL).

We make no copyright claim on diagrams you create with this software.

## Contributions

We do not accept pull requests. The project is developed entirely by the core team. The entire draw.io editor is human written by the core, full-time development team, no AI generation. 

## Scope

draw.io is a diagramming and whiteboarding application. It is not an SVG editor. SVG export is intended for embedding in web pages, not for editing in other tools.

Note that draw.io does not support real-time collaborative editing in this version, currently.

For issues or questions about the editor in any draw.io product, the issue tracker and discussions here are a good starting point.

## Running

Options for running draw.io:

- Fork this repository and [publish to GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) for a [fully functional editor](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) (without integrations)
- Use the [official Docker image](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio)
- Download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net)

Packaged .war files are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).

## Supported Browsers

Chrome 123+, Firefox 120+, Safari 17.5+, Opera 109+, Edge 123+, WebView Android 137+, Safari iOS 18.5+.

## Trademark

draw.io is a registered EU trademark (#018062448).

Do not use the draw.io name or logo in ways that suggest affiliation with, endorsement by, or sponsorship by draw.io. Do not use draw.io logos for your own business, product, project, domain, or social media presence. Do not modify the draw.io logos. Use of draw.io trademarks requires prior written permission.</pre>

Transformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face&#039;s [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:
  - 📝 **Natural Language Processing**: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
  - 🖼️ **Computer Vision**: image classification, object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation.
  - 🗣️ **Audio**: automatic speech recognition, audio classification, and text-to-speech.
  - 🐙 **Multimodal**: embeddings, zero-shot audio classification, zero-shot image classification, and zero-shot object detection.

Transformers.js uses [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to run models in the browser. The best part about it, is that you can easily [convert](#convert-your-models-to-onnx) your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX using [🤗 Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum#onnx--onnx-runtime). 

For more information, check out the full [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js).


## Installation


To install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@huggingface/transformers), run:
```bash
npm i @huggingface/transformers
```

Alternatively, you can use it in vanilla JS, without any bundler, by using a CDN or static hosting. For example, using [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), you can import the library with:
```html
&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;
    import { pipeline } from &#039;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@huggingface/transformers@3.8.1&#039;;
&lt;/script&gt;
```


## Quick tour


It&#039;s super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the python library, we support the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it the easiest way to run models with the library.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th width=&quot;440px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Python (original)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th width=&quot;440px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Javascript (ours)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
pipe = pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;)

out = pipe(&#039;I love transformers!&#039;)
# [{&#039;label&#039;: &#039;POSITIVE&#039;, &#039;score&#039;: 0.999806941}]
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```javascript
import { pipeline } from &#039;@huggingface/transformers&#039;;

// Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
const pipe = await pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;);

const out = await pipe(&#039;I love transformers!&#039;);
// [{&#039;label&#039;: &#039;POSITIVE&#039;, &#039;score&#039;: 0.999817686}]
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


You can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the second argument to the `pipeline` function. For example:
```javascript
// Use a different model for sentiment-analysis
const pipe = await pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;, &#039;Xenova/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment&#039;);
```

By default, when running in the browser, the model will be run on your CPU (via WASM). If you would like
to run the model on your GPU (via WebGPU), you can do this by setting `device: &#039;webgpu&#039;`, for example:
```javascript
// Run the model on WebGPU
const pipe = await pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;, &#039;Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english&#039;, {
  device: &#039;webgpu&#039;,
});
```

For more information, check out the [WebGPU guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/guides/webgpu).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The WebGPU API is still experimental in many browsers, so if you run into any issues,
&gt; please file a [bug report](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/issues/new?title=%5BWebGPU%5D%20Error%20running%20MODEL_ID_GOES_HERE&amp;assignees=&amp;labels=bug,webgpu&amp;projects=&amp;template=1_bug-report.yml).

In resource-constrained environments, such as web browsers, it is advisable to use a quantized version of
the model to lower bandwidth and optimize performance. This can be achieved by adjusting the `dtype` option,
which allows you to select the appropriate data type for your model. While the available options may vary
depending on the specific model, typical choices include `&quot;fp32&quot;` (default for WebGPU), `&quot;fp16&quot;`, `&quot;q8&quot;`
(default for WASM), and `&quot;q4&quot;`. For more information, check out the [quantization guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/guides/dtypes).
```javascript
// Run the model at 4-bit quantization
const pipe = await pipeline(&#039;sentiment-analysis&#039;, &#039;Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english&#039;, {
  dtype: &#039;q4&#039;,
});
```

## Custom usage



By default, Transformers.js uses [hosted pretrained models](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers.js) and [precompiled WASM binaries](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@huggingface/transformers@3.8.1/dist/), which should work out-of-the-box. You can customize this as follows:

### Settings

```javascript
import { env } from &#039;@huggingface/transformers&#039;;

// Specify a custom location for models (defaults to &#039;/models/&#039;).
env.localModelPath = &#039;/path/to/models/&#039;;

// Disable the loading of remote models from the Hugging Face Hub:
env.allowRemoteModels = false;

// Set location of .wasm files. Defaults to use a CDN.
env.backends.onnx.wasm.wasmPaths = &#039;/path/to/files/&#039;;
```

For a full list of available settings, check out the [API Reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/api/env).

### Convert your models to ONNX

We recommend using our [conversion script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/blob/main/scripts/convert.py) to convert your PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX in a single command. Behind the scenes, it uses [🤗 Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum) to perform conversion and quantization of your model.

```bash
python -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id &lt;model_name_or_path&gt;
```

For example, convert and quantize [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) using:
```bash
python -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id bert-base-uncased
```

This will save the following files to `./models/`:

```
bert-base-uncased/
├── config.json
├── tokenizer.json
├── tokenizer_config.json
└── onnx/
    ├── model.onnx
    └── model_quantized.onnx
```

For the full list of supported architectures, see the [Optimum documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/exporters/onnx/overview).

&gt; [!QUESTION] **Is this you?**
&gt; You&#039;re an Obsidian power‑user, researcher, writer, or lifelong learner with **hundreds or thousands of notes**. You capture ideas quickly, but later struggle to find and connect them when it matters most.

&gt; [!WARNING] **The Problem**  
&gt; Valuable insights disappear in a sea of unlinked notes, forcing endless scrolling, rereading, and duplicated work. Time you wanted for creativity leaks away into manual organization.

# Smart Connections v4

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Connections view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
The Connections view shows notes that are semantically related to your current note.

Open it from the left ribbon (Connections icon) or from the command palette by running the `Open: Connection view` command.

![](https://smartconnections.app/assets/connections-view-notes-2025-12-09.gif)

#### Using the Connections view

Connections view results update automatically when you change notes. The name of the current note appears at the bottom left of the Connections view.

![](https://smartconnections.app/assets/Connections-item-view-info-overload-annotated-main-2025-12-09.png)

- **Result score** (yellow underline)  
	The score reflects semantic similarity between the result and the current note. Exact numbers depend on the embedding model.  
- **Show or hide content** (magenta)  
	Expand or collapse individual results. Use the top row button to expand or collapse all.  
- **Play / pause updates** (orange)  
	Control whether the Connections view automatically updates when you change notes.  
- **Lookup query** (teal)  
	Opens the Lookup view for a semantic search across your vault.

&gt; [!NOTE] Semantic search  
&gt; Semantic queries do not behave like plain text search. A note that contains the exact query text might not appear if it is not actually similar in meaning.

#### Interacting with connection results

- Drag a result into a note to create a link.  
- Hold Cmd or Ctrl while hovering over a result to show Obsidian&#039;s Hover Preview.

![](/assets/SC-OP-connections-view-mouse-annotations-2025-05-20.jpg)

#### Hiding and unhiding connections

Right click a result to hide it from the list:  
![](/assets/SC-OP-Connections-view-right-click-to-hide-2025-07-01.png)

Right click any result and use **Unhide all** to bring hidden items back:

&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Lookup view (semantic search)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Use the Lookup view for ad hoc semantic search across your vault.

Open it from the ribbon (Lookup icon) or from the command palette by running the `Open: Lookup view` command.

![](https://smartconnections.app/assets/Lookup-item-view-annotated-new-2025-12-09.png)

&gt; [!NOTE] Semantic search  
&gt; Semantic queries do not work like regular search queries. For example, a note containing the exact query text may not be returned in the results.

![](https://smartconnections.app/assets/Lookup-item-view-annotated-with-query-2025-12-09.png)
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Random connection function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Jump to a random note that is strongly connected to your current one.

- Click the random connection icon in the ribbon, or  
- Run the `Open: Random note from connections` command from the command palette.  

Note: the random connection command requires the Connections view to be active.
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;


## What&#039;s new in v4?

Smart Connections v4 focuses the core plugin on a simple promise: install, enable, and AI-powered connections just work. Advanced configuration and power-user workflows now live in Pro plugins. Read [Introducing Pro Plugins](https://smartconnections.app/introducing-pro-plugins/?utm_source=connections-readme) to learn more.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Pause connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Use the new Connections &quot;pause&quot; button to freeze the connections results. This allows you to move through your vault while keeping the connections to a specific note visible while you work.
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Copy connections as list of links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Right-click the connections results to *copy all links* to clipboard.
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Copy all connections content (Context Engineering)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Click the connections view menu button and &quot;Send to Smart Context&quot; (briefcase icon) option. This allows you to quickly copy *all content from the connections* to clipboard for use as context with any AI chat! The Smart Context view also lets you add or remove items before copying all to the clipboard in one-click!
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Pinned connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
In addition to &quot;hiding&quot; connections, you can now &quot;Pin&quot; connections. This ensures the pinned connections are always visible in the connections view. **Connections Pro:** *Hidden and pinned connections are used by new connections algorithms (available in Pro) to improve results!*
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Connections Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Connections Pro builds on the core plugin and Smart Environment to give power users more control.

![](https://smartconnections.app/assets/connections-view-pro-notes.gif)

Examples of Pro features:

- **Inline connections**  
	Small badges in the editor that show how many strong matches a block has, with a pop-over of related blocks and notes.  
- **Footer connections**  
	A persistent panel that updates as you type so high value connections stay visible while you write.  
- **Configurable scoring and ranking**  
	Choose different algorithms for how results are scored and optionally add a rerank stage.  
- **Connections in Bases**  
	Use `score_connection` and `list_connections` in Obsidian Bases to show similarity columns and related note lists in tables.  
- **Advanced filters and models**  
	Extra Smart Environment controls for embeddings, collections, and include or exclude rules.  
- **Early release experiments**  
	New ideas launch in Early channels first so supporters can shape how they evolve.

Connections Pro is part of the [Pro plugins](https://smartconnections.app/pro-plugins/?utm_source=connections-readme) family and is available to active project supporters. It is still built on the same open Smart Environment. Supporting Pro helps fund development of all Smart Plugins and the free core.
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Events and notifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Important events are now surfaced in a dedicated notifications modal:
- On desktop, click the Smart Env item in the status bar to open the notifications modal.  
- On mobile, a Smart Environment notice appears at the bottom of the Connections view; tap it to review events.

Examples of events you might see:
- Initial indexing complete for your vault  
- Sources reimported after model changes  
- Warnings when exclusions block indexing on specific folders or files  

Objectives of the new Events system:
- make the environment inspectable and understandable
- reduce the number of Obsidian native notifications
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## Private by Design, Local-first by Default

User-aligned means privacy and local first are design constraints, not optional checkboxes.

- Embeddings are created locally by default.  
- Your notes stay on your machine. 
- Smart Environment gives you a single place to control common configurations that apply to all Smart Plugins.

Privacy should not be a premium feature. *Smart Plugins are private by default!*

## Mission-driven

The Obsidian community opened my eyes to user-aligned software. Smart Connections is built on a set of principles designed to keep power in the hands of individuals, not platforms.

&gt; [!INFO] Your guide  
&gt; Built by Brian, a fellow Obsidian user who felt the same pain, Smart Connections pairs hard won experience with source available AI expertise to lead you from overwhelm to insight.

## Built for You

&gt; [!NOTE] Why Smart Connections  
&gt; Smart Connections started as a personal tool. The Obsidian community turned it into a shared project and helped refine it into something that can actually keep up with real workflows.

Smart Connections exists so you can:

- Spend less time hunting through old notes.  
- Spend more time writing, synthesizing, and shipping.  
- Stop worrying that important research is lost somewhere in your vault.

It is not about features for their own sake. It is about empowerment.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Built from scratch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;Building the Smart Environment, the core architecture behind Smart Connections, from scratch has empowered me with a deep understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI. These insights contribute to why I believe the Smart Environment will outlast me.&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--font-weight: var(--h3-weight); font-variant: var(--h3-variant); letter-spacing: var(--h3-letter-spacing); line-height: var(--h3-line-height); font-size: var(--h3-size); color: var(--h3-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight); font-style: var(--h3-style); font-family: var(--h3-font); cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;Built on principles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;Building from scratch is also what makes the Smart Environment and Smart Plugins worth your trust. Nearly all of the code comes from a single (principle: minimal/no dependencies). That means you don&#039;t have to worry about waking up to learn about major supply chain attacks that target the most popular and most used dependencies.&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## 📖 使用指南

### 1. Token导入与管理

#### 支持的导入方式

##### 方式一：手动输入
支持多种Base64格式的Token字符串：

```javascript
// 纯Base64格式
&quot;eyJ0b2tlbiI6ImFiY2QxMjM0In0=&quot;

// 带前缀格式
&quot;token:eyJ0b2tlbiI6ImFiY2QxMjM0In0=&quot;
```

##### 方式二：URL接口获取
通过API接口自动获取Token，支持定时刷新：

```javascript
// API接口返回格式
{
  &quot;token&quot;: &quot;eyJ0b2tlbiI6ImFiY2QxMjM0In0=&quot;,  // 必需字段
  &quot;server&quot;: &quot;风云服&quot;                        // 可选字段
}
```

##### 方式三：批量导入
支持通过bin文件或多行输入同时导入多个Token。

支持伏羲bin文件格式的Token批量导入。

#### 导入步骤
1. 进入 **Token管理** 页面
2. 选择导入方式：
   - **手动输入**：粘贴Base64编码的Token字符串
   - **URL获取**：输入Token获取接口地址
3. 系统自动解析和验证Token格式
4. 设置角色名称和基本信息
5. 保存到本地存储

#### Token刷新功能
- 通过URL方式导入的Token支持一键刷新
- 刷新时会重新请求原API接口获取最新Token
- 自动重新建立WebSocket连接
- 保持角色信息和配置不变

### 2. WebSocket连接配置

纯本地连接存储，不用担心封号及账号泄漏风险

### 3. BON协议消息处理

```javascript
import { bon, GameMessages } from &#039;@/utils/bonProtocol.js&#039;;

// 编码消息
const message = GameMessages.getRoleInfo(0, 12345);
const encoded = bon.encode(message.body);

// 解码消息
const decoded = bon.decode(receivedData);
```

### 4. 主题系统使用

#### 主题切换功能
- **位置**：在页面右上角可以找到圆形的主题切换按钮
- **图标说明**：
  - ☀️ 太阳图标：当前为浅色主题，点击切换到深色主题
  - 🌙 月亮图标：当前为深色主题，点击切换到浅色主题
- **自动记忆**：用户的主题选择会自动保存，下次访问时自动应用
- **系统同步**：首次访问时会自动检测系统主题偏好

#### 技术实现特点
```javascript
// 使用主题切换组件
import ThemeToggle from &#039;@/components/ThemeToggle.vue&#039;
import { useTheme } from &#039;@/composables/useTheme&#039;

const { isDark, toggleTheme } = useTheme()
```

### 5. 游戏功能使用

## 🧪 测试与调试

### 内置测试工具

#### 1. 消息测试器 (MessageTester.vue)
- BON协议编码/解码测试
- 消息格式验证
- 加密/解密功能测试

#### 2. WebSocket调试器 (WebSocketTester.vue)
- 实时连接状态监控
- 消息发送和接收测试
- 连接参数配置

#### 3. 协议验证工具
```javascript
// 测试BON编码
const testData = { cmd: &quot;test&quot;, data: { id: 123 } };
const encoded = bon.encode(testData);
const decoded = bon.decode(encoded);
console.log(&#039;编码测试:&#039;, decoded);

// 测试加密
const encrypted = getEnc(&#039;x&#039;).encrypt(encoded);
const decrypted = getEnc(&#039;x&#039;).decrypt(encrypted);
```

### 调试技巧

1. **浏览器开发工具**：使用Vue DevTools监控组件状态
2. **网络面板**：监控WebSocket消息传输
3. **控制台日志**：查看详细的协议处理日志
4. **本地存储检查**：验证Token和配置存储

---

## 📦 项目结构详解

### 状态管理架构

```javascript
// tokenStore.js - 核心Token管理
const useTokenStore = defineStore(&#039;tokens&#039;, () =&gt; {
  const gameTokens = ref([]);           // Token列表
  const selectedTokenId = ref(null);    // 当前选中Token
  const wsConnections = ref({});        // WebSocket连接池
  
  // Token管理方法
  const addToken = (tokenData) =&gt; { /* ... */ };
  const updateToken = (id, updates) =&gt; { /* ... */ };
  const removeToken = (id) =&gt; { /* ... */ };
  
  // WebSocket管理
  const connectWebSocket = (tokenId) =&gt; { /* ... */ };
  const disconnectWebSocket = (tokenId) =&gt; { /* ... */ };
  
  return { 
    gameTokens, selectedTokenId, wsConnections,
    addToken, updateToken, removeToken,
    connectWebSocket, disconnectWebSocket
  };
});
```

### 路由守卫系统

```javascript
// router/index.js
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) =&gt; {
  const tokenStore = useTokenStore();
  
  if (to.meta.requiresToken &amp;&amp; !tokenStore.hasTokens) {
    next(&#039;/tokens&#039;); // 重定向到Token管理页
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

### 组件通信模式

```javascript
// 父子组件通信
// Parent.vue
&lt;TokenManager 
  :tokens=&quot;tokens&quot; 
  @token-selected=&quot;handleTokenSelect&quot;
  @token-updated=&quot;handleTokenUpdate&quot; /&gt;

// 兄弟组件通信（通过Store）
const tokenStore = useTokenStore();
const gameData = computed(() =&gt; tokenStore.gameData);
```

---

## 🔐 安全特性

### 数据安全
- **本地存储**：所有敏感数据仅存储在浏览器本地
- **Token掩码**：界面显示时自动掩码处理（显示首尾4位）
- **加密传输**：WebSocket消息使用多重加密协议
- **会话隔离**：每个Tab页面独立的连接会话

### 协议安全
```javascript
// 多重加密支持
const encryptors = {
  lx: lzCompressionWithMask,      // LZ4压缩+头部掩码
  x: randomHeaderWithXOR,         // 随机头部+XOR加密
  xtm: xxteaEncryption           // XXTEA加密算法
};

// 自动加密检测和解密
const autoDecrypt = (data) =&gt; {
  if (isLXFormat(data)) return lx.decrypt(data);
  if (isXFormat(data)) return x.decrypt(data);
  if (isXTMFormat(data)) return xtm.decrypt(data);
  return data;
};
```

### 内存优化
```javascript
// 响应式数据优化
const gameData = computed(() =&gt; {
  return tokenStore.gameData || {};
});

// 组件卸载时清理
onUnmounted(() =&gt; {
  if (wsClient.value) {
    wsClient.value.disconnect();
  }
});
```

# 安装&amp;升级

```
bash &lt;(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaxilu/x-ui/master/install.sh)
```

## 手动安装&amp;升级

1. 首先从 https://github.com/vaxilu/x-ui/releases 下载最新的压缩包，一般选择 `amd64`架构
2. 然后将这个压缩包上传到服务器的 `/root/`目录下，并使用 `root`用户登录服务器

&gt; 如果你的服务器 cpu 架构不是 `amd64`，自行将命令中的 `amd64`替换为其他架构

```
cd /root/
rm x-ui/ /usr/local/x-ui/ /usr/bin/x-ui -rf
tar zxvf x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x x-ui/x-ui x-ui/bin/xray-linux-* x-ui/x-ui.sh
cp x-ui/x-ui.sh /usr/bin/x-ui
cp -f x-ui/x-ui.service /etc/systemd/system/
mv x-ui/ /usr/local/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable x-ui
systemctl restart x-ui
```

## 使用docker安装

&gt; 此 docker 教程与 docker 镜像由[Chasing66](https://github.com/Chasing66)提供

1. 安装docker

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

2. 安装x-ui

```shell
mkdir x-ui &amp;&amp; cd x-ui
docker run -itd --network=host \
    -v $PWD/db/:/etc/x-ui/ \
    -v $PWD/cert/:/root/cert/ \
    --name x-ui --restart=unless-stopped \
    enwaiax/x-ui:latest
```

&gt; Build 自己的镜像

```shell
docker build -t x-ui .
```

## SSL证书申请

&gt; 此功能与教程由[FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)提供

脚本内置SSL证书申请功能，使用该脚本申请证书，需满足以下条件:

- 知晓Cloudflare 注册邮箱
- 知晓Cloudflare Global API Key
- 域名已通过cloudflare进行解析到当前服务器

获取Cloudflare Global API Key的方法:
    ![](media/bda84fbc2ede834deaba1c173a932223.png)
    ![](media/d13ffd6a73f938d1037d0708e31433bf.png)

使用时只需输入 `域名`, `邮箱`, `API KEY`即可，示意图如下：
        ![](media/2022-04-04_141259.png)

注意事项:

- 该脚本使用DNS API进行证书申请
- 默认使用Let&#039;sEncrypt作为CA方
- 证书安装目录为/root/cert目录
- 本脚本申请证书均为泛域名证书

## Tg机器人使用（开发中，暂不可使用）

&gt; 此功能与教程由[FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)提供

X-UI支持通过Tg机器人实现每日流量通知，面板登录提醒等功能，使用Tg机器人，需要自行申请
具体申请教程可以参考[博客链接](https://coderfan.net/how-to-use-telegram-bot-to-alarm-you-when-someone-login-into-your-vps.html)
使用说明:在面板后台设置机器人相关参数，具体包括

- Tg机器人Token
- Tg机器人ChatId
- Tg机器人周期运行时间，采用crontab语法  

参考语法：
- 30 * * * * * //每一分的第30s进行通知
- @hourly      //每小时通知
- @daily       //每天通知（凌晨零点整）
- @every 8h    //每8小时通知  

TG通知内容：
- 节点流量使用
- 面板登录提醒
- 节点到期提醒
- 流量预警提醒  

更多功能规划中...
## 建议系统

- CentOS 7+
- Ubuntu 16+
- Debian 8+

# 常见问题

## 从 v2-ui 迁移

首先在安装了 v2-ui 的服务器上安装最新版 x-ui，然后使用以下命令进行迁移，将迁移本机 v2-ui 的 `所有 inbound 账号数据`至 x-ui，`面板设置和用户名密码不会迁移`

&gt; 迁移成功后请 `关闭 v2-ui`并且 `重启 x-ui`，否则 v2-ui 的 inbound 会与 x-ui 的 inbound 会产生 `端口冲突`

```
x-ui v2-ui
```

## issue 关闭

各种小白问题看得血压很高
