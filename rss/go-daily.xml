## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don&#039;t need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Method 1: Using Make commands (Recommended)
make dev-start      # Start infrastructure
make dev-app        # Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend (new terminal)

# Method 2: One-click start
./scripts/quick-dev.sh

# Method 3: Using scripts
./scripts/dev.sh start     # Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev.sh app       # Start backend (new terminal)
./scripts/dev.sh frontend  # Start frontend (new terminal)
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging

Build scalable games and apps with a production ready server used by ambitious game studios and app developers [all around the world](https://heroiclabs.com/customers/). Have a look at the [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs) and join the [developer community](https://forum.heroiclabs.com) for more info.

## Getting Started

The server is simple to setup and run for local development and can be deployed to any cloud provider. See the [deployment notes](#deployment) for recommendations on how to deploy the project for production. Nakama server requires CockroachDB or another Postgres wire-compatible server as it&#039;s database.

### Docker

&lt;a href=&quot;https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Docker_logo.svg&quot; width=&quot;170&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The fastest way to run the server and the database is with Docker. Setup Docker and start the daemon.

1. Set up a [docker-compose file](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/install/docker/#running-nakama) and place it in a folder for your project.

2. Run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up` to download container images and run the servers.

For more detailed instructions have a look at our [Docker quickstart](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/install/docker) guide.

Nakama Docker images are maintained on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama/tags) and [prerelease](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama-prerelease/tags) images are occasionally published for cutting edge features of the server.

### Binaries

You can run the servers with native binaries for your platform.

1. Download the server from our [releases](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases) page and the [database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb.html).

2. Follow the database [instructions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html#before-you-begin) to start it.

3. Run a migration which will setup or upgrade the database schema:

   ```shell
   nakama migrate up --database.address &quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;
   ```

4. Start Nakama and connect to the database:

   ```shell
   nakama --database.address &quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;
   ```

When connected you&#039;ll see server output which describes all settings the server uses for [configuration](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/configuration).

&gt; {&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;ts&quot;:&quot;2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;Node&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;nakama&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2.0.0+7e18b09&quot;,&quot;runtime&quot;:&quot;go1.10.1&quot;,&quot;cpu&quot;:4} &lt;br/&gt;
&gt; {&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;ts&quot;:&quot;2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;Database connections&quot;,&quot;dsns&quot;:[&quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;]} &lt;br/&gt;
&gt; ...

## Usage

Nakama supports a variety of protocols optimized for various gameplay or app use cases. For request/response it can use GRPC or the HTTP1.1+JSON fallback (REST). For realtime communication you can use WebSockets or rUDP.

For example with the REST API to authenticate a user account with a device identifier.

```shell
curl &quot;127.0.0.1:7350/v2/account/authenticate/device?create=true&quot; \
  --user &quot;defaultkey:&quot; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;someuniqueidentifier&quot;}&#039;
```

Response:

&gt; { &lt;br&gt;
&gt;     &quot;token&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjQ5OTU2NDksInVpZCI6Ijk5Y2Q1YzUyLWE5ODgtNGI2NC04YThhLTVmMTM5YTg4MTgxMiIsInVzbiI6InhBb1RxTUVSdFgifQ.-3_rXNYx3Q4jKuS7RkxeMWBzMNAm0vl93QxzRI8p_IY&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; }

There&#039;s a number of official [client libraries](https://github.com/heroiclabs) available on GitHub with [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs). The current platform/language support includes: .NET (in C#), Unity engine, JavaScript, Java (with Android), Unreal engine, Godot, Defold, and Swift (with iOS). If you&#039;d like to contribute a client or request one let us know.

## Nakama Console

The server provides a web UI which teams can use to inspect various data stored through the server APIs, view lightweight service metrics, manage player data, update storage objects, restrict access to production with permission profiles, and gain visibility into realtime features like active multiplayer matches. There is no separate installation required as it is embedded as part of the single server binary.

You can navigate to it on your browser on [http://127.0.0.1:7351](http://127.0.0.1:7351).

&lt;/details&gt;

## Deployment

Nakama can be deployed to any cloud provider such as Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, or your own private cloud. You should setup and provision separate nodes for Nakama and CockroachDB.

The recommended minimum production infrastructure for CockroachDB is outlined in [these docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/recommended-production-settings.html#basic-hardware-recommendations) and Nakama can be run on instance types as small as &quot;g1-small&quot; on Google Cloud although we recommend a minimum of &quot;n1-standard-1&quot; in production. The specific hardware requirements will depend on what features of the server are used. Reach out to us for help and advice on what servers to run.

### Heroic Cloud

You can support development, new features, and maintainance of the server by using the Heroic Labs&#039; [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) for deployment. This service handles the uptime, replication, backups, logs, data upgrades, and all other tasks involved with production server environments.

Have a look at our [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) service for more details.

## Contribute

The development roadmap is managed as GitHub issues and pull requests are welcome. If you&#039;re interested to add a feature which is not mentioned on the issue tracker please open one to create a discussion or drop in and discuss it in the [community forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com).

### Simple Builds

All dependencies required for a build are vendored as part of the Go project. We recommend a modern release of the Go toolchain and do not store the codebase in the old GOPATH.

1. Download the source tree.

   ```shell
   git clone &quot;https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama&quot; nakama
   cd nakama
   ```

2. Build the project from source.

   ```shell
   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor
   ./nakama --version
   ```

### Full Source Builds

The codebase uses Protocol Buffers, GRPC, GRPC-Gateway, and the OpenAPI spec as part of the project. These dependencies are generated as sources and committed to the repository to simplify builds for contributors.

To build the codebase and generate all sources follow these steps.

1. Install the toolchain.

   ```shell
   go install \
       &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot; \
       &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot; \
       &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot; \
       &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
   ```

2. Re-generate the protocol buffers and gateway code.

   ```shell
   buf generate apigrpc -o apigrpc
   buf generate console -o console
   ```

3. Build the codebase.

   ```shell
   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor
   ```

### Testing

In order to run all the unit and integration tests run:

```shell
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-tests.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit; docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-tests.yml down -v
```

This will create an isolated environment with Nakama and database instances, run
all the tests, and drop the environment afterwards.

## One-line Compilation

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED=0
go build -o xray.exe -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Reproducible Releases

Make sure that you are using the same Go version, and remember to set the git commit id (7 bytes):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;all=-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

If you are compiling a 32-bit MIPS/MIPSLE target, use this command instead:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

Ory Kratos is an API first identity and user management system for cloud native applications. It centralizes login, registration, recovery, verification, and profile management flows so your services consume them instead of reimplementing them.

## What is Ory Kratos?

Ory Kratos is an API first identity and user management system that follows [cloud architecture best practices](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/software-architecture-philosophy). It focuses on core identity workflows that almost every application needs:

- Self service login and registration
- Account verification and recovery
- Multi factor authentication
- Profile and account management
- Identity schemas and traits
- Admin APIs for lifecycle management

We recommend starting with the [Ory Kratos introduction docs](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/) to learn more about its architecture, feature set, and how it compares to other systems.

### Why Ory Kratos

Ory Kratos is designed to:

- Remove identity logic from your application code and expose it over HTTP APIs
- Work well with any UI framework through browser based and native app flows
- Scale to large numbers of identities and devices
- Integrate with the rest of the Ory stack for OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and access control
- Fit into modern cloud native environments such as Kubernetes and managed platforms
-
## Migrating from Auth0, Okta, and similar providers

If you are migrating from Auth0, Okta, or another identity provider that uses OAuth2 / OpenID Connect based login, consider using **Ory Hydra + Ory Kratos** together:

- **Ory Hydra** acts as the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect provider and can replace most authorization server and token issuing capabilities of your existing IdP.
- **Ory Kratos** provides identity, credentials, and user-facing flows (login, registration, recovery, verification, profile management).

This combination is often a drop-in replacement for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect capabilities at the protocol level. In practice, you update client configuration and endpoints to point to Hydra, migrate identities into Kratos, and keep your applications speaking the same OAuth2 / OIDC protocols they already use.

## Deployment options

You can run Ory Kratos in two main ways:

- As a managed service on the Ory Network
- As a self hosted service under your own control, with or without the Ory Enterprise License

### Use Ory Kratos on the Ory Network

The [Ory Network](https://www.ory.sh/cloud) is the fastest way to use Ory services in production. **Ory Identities** is powered by the open source Ory Kratos server and is API compatible.

The Ory Network provides:

- Identity and credential management that scales to billions of users and devices
- Registration, login, and account management flows for passkeys, biometrics, social login, SSO, and multi factor authentication
- Prebuilt login, registration, and account management pages and components
- OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for single sign on, API access, and machine to machine authorization
- Low latency permission checks based on the Zanzibar model with the Ory Permission Language
- GDPR friendly storage with data locality and compliance in mind
- Web based Ory Console and Ory CLI for administration and operations
- Cloud native APIs compatible with the open source servers
- Fair, usage based [pricing](https://www.ory.sh/pricing)

Sign up for a [free developer account](https://console.ory.sh/registration?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=kratos-readme) to get started.

### Self-host Ory Kratos

You can run Ory Kratos yourself for full control over infrastructure, deployment, and customization.

The [install guide](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/install) explains how to:

* Install Kratos on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Docker
* Configure databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and CockroachDB
* Deploy to Kubernetes and other orchestration systems
* Build Kratos from source

This guide uses the open source distribution to get you started without license requirements. It is a great fit for individuals, researchers, hackers, and companies that want to experiment, prototype, or run unimportant workloads without SLAs. You get the full core engine, and you are free to inspect, extend, and build it from source.

If you run Kratos as part of a business-critical system, for example login and account recovery for all your users, you should use a commercial agreement to reduce operational and security risk. The **Ory Enterprise License (OEL)** layers on top of self-hosted Kratos and provides:

* Additional enterprise features that are not available in the open source version such as SCIM, SAML, organization login (&quot;SSO&quot;), CAPTCHAs and more
* Regular security releases, including CVE patches, with service level agreements
* Support for advanced scaling, multi-tenancy, and complex deployments
* Premium support options with SLAs, direct access to engineers, and onboarding help
* Access to a private Docker registry with frequent and vetted, up-to-date enterprise builds

For guaranteed CVE fixes, current enterprise builds, advanced features, and support in production, you need a valid [Ory Enterprise License](https://www.ory.com/ory-enterprise-license) and access to the Ory Enterprise Docker registry. To learn more, [contact the Ory team](https://www.ory.sh/contact/).

## Quickstart

Install the [Ory CLI](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/installation) and create a new project to try Ory Identities.

```bash
# Install the Ory CLI if you do not have it yet:
bash &lt;(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) -b . ory
sudo mv ./ory /usr/local/bin/

# Sign in or sign up
ory auth

# Create a new project
ory create project --create-workspace &quot;Ory Open Source&quot; --name &quot;GitHub Quickstart&quot;  --use-project
ory open ax login
```

# Yay

Yet Another Yogurt - An AUR Helper Written in Go

### Help translate yay: [Transifex](https://app.transifex.com/yay-1/yay/)

## Features

- Advanced dependency solving
- PKGBUILD downloading from ABS or AUR
- Completions for AUR packages
- Query user up-front for all input (prior to starting builds)
- Narrow search (`yay linux header` will first search `linux` and then narrow on `header`)

## Installation

If you are migrating from another AUR helper, you can simply install Yay with that helper.

&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; We are using `sudo` in these examples, you can switch that out for a different privilege escalation tool.

### Source

The initial installation of Yay can be done by cloning the PKGBUILD and
building with makepkg:

We make sure we have the `base-devel` package group installed.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel &amp;&amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git &amp;&amp; cd yay &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
```

### Binary

If you do not want to compile yay yourself you can use the builds generated by
GitHub Actions.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel &amp;&amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git &amp;&amp; cd yay-bin &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
```

### Other distributions

If you&#039;re using Manjaro or [another distribution that packages `yay`](https://repology.org/project/yay/versions)
you can simply install yay using pacman (as root):

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel yay
```
&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; distributions sometimes lag updating yay on their repositories.

## First Use

#### Development packages upgrade

- Use `yay -Y --gendb` to generate a development package database for `*-git`
  packages that were installed without yay.
  This command should only be run once.

- `yay -Syu --devel` will then check for development package updates

- Use `yay -Y --devel --save` to make development package updates permanently
  enabled (`yay` and `yay -Syu` will then always check dev packages)

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Yay does not display colored output. How do I fix it?**

  Make sure you have the `Color` option in your `/etc/pacman.conf`
  (see issue [#123](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/123)).

- **Sometimes diffs are printed to the terminal, and other times they are paged via less. How do I fix this?**

  Yay uses `git diff` to display diffs, which by default tells less not to
  page if the output can fit into one terminal length. This behavior can be
  overridden by exporting your own flags (`export LESS=SRX`).

- **Yay is not asking me to edit PKGBUILDS, and I don&#039;t like the diff menu! What can I do?**

  `yay --editmenu --diffmenu=false --save`

- **How can I tell Yay to act only on AUR packages, or only on repo packages?**

  `yay -{OPERATION} --aur`
  `yay -{OPERATION} --repo`

- **A `Flagged Out Of Date AUR Packages` message is displayed. Why doesn&#039;t Yay update them?**

  This message does not mean that updated AUR packages are available. It means
  the packages have been flagged out of date on the AUR, but
  their maintainers have not yet updated the `PKGBUILD`s
  (see [outdated AUR packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Foo_in_the_AUR_is_outdated.3B_what_should_I_do.3F)).

- **Yay doesn&#039;t install dependencies added to a PKGBUILD during installation.**

  Yay resolves all dependencies ahead of time. You are free to edit the
  PKGBUILD in any way, but any problems you cause are your own and should not be
  reported unless they can be reproduced with the original PKGBUILD.

- **I know my `-git` package has updates but yay doesn&#039;t offer to update it**

  Yay uses a hash cache for development packages. Normally it is updated at the end of the package install with the message `Found git repo`.
  If you transition between aur helpers and did not install the devel package using yay at some point, it is possible it never got added to the cache. `yay -Y --gendb` will fix the current version of every devel package and start checking from there.

- **I want to help out!**

  Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Support

All support related to Yay should be requested via GitHub issues. Since Yay is not
officially supported by Arch Linux, support should not be sought out on the
forums, AUR comments or other official channels.

A broken AUR package should be reported as a comment on the package&#039;s AUR page.
A package may only be considered broken if it fails to build with makepkg.

Reports should be made using makepkg and include the full output as well as any
other relevant information. Never make reports using Yay or any other external
tools.

# 🚀 Start the Backend Locally

We have an `acontext-cli` to help you do quick proof-of-concept. Download it first in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.acontext.io | sh
```

You should have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and an OpenAI API Key to start an Acontext backend on your computer:

```bash
mkdir acontext_server &amp;&amp; cd acontext_server
acontext docker up
```

&gt; [📖 local setup](https://docs.acontext.io/local#start-acontext-server-locally) Acontext requires at least an OpenAI API key. We recommend `gpt-5.1` or `gpt-4.1` as the LLM model

`acontext docker up` will create/use  `.env` and `config.yaml` for Acontext, and create a `db` folder to persist data.



Once it&#039;s done, you can access the following endpoints:

- Acontext API Base URL: http://localhost:8029/api/v1
- Acontext Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/



&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






# 🧐 Use Acontext to build Agent

Download end-to-end scripts with `acontext`:

**Python**

```bash
acontext create my-proj --template-path &quot;python/openai-basic&quot;
```

&gt; More examples on Python:
&gt;
&gt; - `python/openai-agent-basic`: self-learning agent in openai agent sdk.
&gt; - `python/agno-basic`: self-learning agent in agno frameworkd.
&gt; - `python/openai-agent-artifacts`: agent that can edit and download artifacts.

**Typescript**

```bash
acontext create my-proj --template-path &quot;typescript/openai-basic&quot;
```

&gt; More examples on Typescript:
&gt;
&gt; - `typescript/vercel-ai-basic`: self-learning agent in @vercel/ai-sdk

## SDK Walk-through

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to Open&lt;/summary&gt;


We&#039;re maintaining Python [![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/acontext.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/acontext/) and Typescript [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@acontext/acontext.svg?logo=npm&amp;logoColor=fff&amp;style=flat&amp;labelColor=2C2C2C&amp;color=28CF8D)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@acontext/acontext) SDKs. The snippets below are using Python.

## Install SDKs

```
pip install acontext # for Python
npm i @acontext/acontext # for Typescript
```



## Initialize Client

```python
from acontext import AcontextClient

client = AcontextClient(
    base_url=&quot;http://localhost:8029/api/v1&quot;,
    api_key=&quot;sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token&quot;
)
client.ping()

# yes, the default api_key is sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token
```

&gt; [📖 async client doc](https://docs.acontext.io/settings/core)



## Store

Acontext can manage agent sessions and artifacts.

### Save Messages [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/api-reference/session/send-message-to-session)

Acontext offers persistent storage for message data. When you call `session.send_message`, Acontext will persist the message and start to monitor this session:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Code Snippet&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
session = client.sessions.create()

messages = [
    {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I need to write a landing page of iPhone 15 pro max&quot;},
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sure, my plan is below:\n1. Search for the latest news about iPhone 15 pro max\n2. Init Next.js project for the landing page\n3. Deploy the landing page to the website&quot;,
    }
]

# Save messages
for msg in messages:
    client.sessions.send_message(session_id=session.id, blob=msg, format=&quot;openai&quot;)
```

&gt; [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/store/messages/multi-modal) We also support multi-modal message storage and anthropic SDK.


&lt;/details&gt;

### Load Messages [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/api-reference/session/get-messages-from-session)

Obtain your session messages using `sessions.get_messages`

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Code Snippet&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
r = client.sessions.get_messages(session.id)
new_msg = r.items

new_msg.append({&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How are you doing?&quot;})
r = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model=&quot;gpt-4.1&quot;, messages=new_msg)
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
client.sessions.send_message(session_id=session.id, blob=r.choices[0].message)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Session&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/message_viewer.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can view sessions in your local Dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


### Artifacts [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/store/disk)

Create a disk for your agent to store and read artifacts using file paths:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Code Snippet&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
from acontext import FileUpload

disk = client.disks.create()

file = FileUpload(
    filename=&quot;todo.md&quot;,
    content=b&quot;# Sprint Plan\n\n## Goals\n- Complete user authentication\n- Fix critical bugs&quot;
)
artifact = client.disks.artifacts.upsert(
    disk.id,
    file=file,
    file_path=&quot;/todo/&quot;
)


print(client.disks.artifacts.list(
    disk.id,
    path=&quot;/todo/&quot;
))

result = client.disks.artifacts.get(
    disk.id,
    file_path=&quot;/todo/&quot;,
    filename=&quot;todo.md&quot;,
    with_public_url=True,
    with_content=True
)
print(f&quot;✓ File content: {result.content.raw}&quot;)
print(f&quot;✓ Download URL: {result.public_url}&quot;)        
```
&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Artifacts&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/artifact_viewer.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can view artifacts in your local Dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



## Observe [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/observe)

For every session, Acontext will **automatically** launch a background agent to track the task progress and user feedback. **It&#039;s like a background TODO agent**. Acontext will use it to observe your daily agent success rate.

You can use the SDK to retrieve the current state of the agent session, for Context Engineering like Reduction and Compression. 

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Full Script&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
from acontext import AcontextClient

# Initialize client
client = AcontextClient(
    base_url=&quot;http://localhost:8029/api/v1&quot;, api_key=&quot;sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token&quot;
)

# Create a project and session
session = client.sessions.create()

# Conversation messages
messages = [
    {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I need to write a landing page of iPhone 15 pro max&quot;},
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sure, my plan is below:\n1. Search for the latest news about iPhone 15 pro max\n2. Init Next.js project for the landing page\n3. Deploy the landing page to the website&quot;,
    },
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;That sounds good. Let&#039;s first collect the message and report to me before any landing page coding.&quot;,
    },
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sure, I will first collect the message then report to you before any landing page coding.&quot;,
      	&quot;tool_calls&quot;: [
            {
                &quot;id&quot;: &quot;call_001&quot;,
                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;function&quot;,
                &quot;function&quot;: {
                    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;search_news&quot;,
                    &quot;arguments&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;query\&quot;: \&quot;iPhone news\&quot;}&quot;
                }
            }
        ]
    },
]

# Send messages in a loop
for msg in messages:
    client.sessions.send_message(session_id=session.id, blob=msg, format=&quot;openai&quot;)

# Wait for task extraction to complete
client.sessions.flush(session.id)

# Display extracted tasks
tasks_response = client.sessions.get_tasks(session.id)
print(tasks_response)
for task in tasks_response.items:
    print(f&quot;\nTask #{task.order}:&quot;)
    print(f&quot;  ID: {task.id}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;  Title: {task.data[&#039;task_description&#039;]}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;  Status: {task.status}&quot;)

    # Show progress updates if available
    if &quot;progresses&quot; in task.data:
        print(f&quot;  Progress updates: {len(task.data[&#039;progresses&#039;])}&quot;)
        for progress in task.data[&quot;progresses&quot;]:
            print(f&quot;    - {progress}&quot;)

    # Show user preferences if available
    if &quot;user_preferences&quot; in task.data:
        print(&quot;  User preferences:&quot;)
        for pref in task.data[&quot;user_preferences&quot;]:
            print(f&quot;    - {pref}&quot;)

```
&gt; `flush` is a blocking call, it will wait for the task extraction to complete.
&gt; You don&#039;t need to call it in production, Acontext has a [buffer mechanism](https://docs.acontext.io/observe/buffer) to ensure the task extraction is completed right on time.

&lt;/details&gt;

Example Task Return:

```txt
Task #1:
  Title: Search for the latest news about iPhone 15 Pro Max and report findings to the user before any landing page coding.
  Status: success
  Progress updates: 2
    - I confirmed that the first step will be reporting before moving on to landing page development.
    - I have already collected all the iPhone 15 pro max info and reported to the user, waiting for approval for next step.
  User preferences:
    - user expects a report on latest news about iPhone 15 pro max before any coding work on the landing page.

Task #2:
  Title: Initialize a Next.js project for the iPhone 15 Pro Max landing page.
  Status: pending

Task #3:
  Title: Deploy the completed landing page to the website.
  Status: pending
```



You can view the session tasks&#039; statuses in the Dashboard:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Acontext Learning&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/session_task_viewer.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Task Demo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



## Self-learning

Acontext can gather a bunch of sessions and learn skills (SOPs) on how to call tools for certain tasks.

### Learn Skills to a `Space` [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/learn/skill-space)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;A Space Demo&quot; src=&quot;./assets/acontext_dataflow.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How self-learning works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A `Space` can store skills, and memories in a Notion-like system. You first need to connect a session to `Space` to enable the learning process:

```python
# Step 1: Create a Space for skill learning
space = client.spaces.create()
print(f&quot;Created Space: {space.id}&quot;)

# Step 2: Create a session attached to the space
session = client.sessions.create(space_id=space.id)

# ... push the agent working context
```

The learning happens in the background and is not real-time (delay around 10-30s). 

What Acontext will do in the background:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Task Completed] --&gt; B[Task Extraction]
    B --&gt; C{Space Connected?}
    C --&gt;|Yes| D[Queue for Learning]
    C --&gt;|No| E[Skip Learning]
    D --&gt; F[Extract SOP]
    F --&gt; G{Hard Enough?}
    G --&gt;|No - Too Simple| H[Skip Learning]
    G --&gt;|Yes - Complex| I[Store as Skill Block]
    I --&gt; J[Available for Future Sessions]
```

Eventually, SOP blocks with tool-call pattern will be saved to `Space`. You can view every `Space` in the Dashboard:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;A Space Demo&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/skill_viewer.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Space Demo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




### Search Skills from a `Space` [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/learn/search-skills)

To search skills from a `Space` and use them in the next session:

```python
result = client.spaces.experience_search(
    space_id=space.id,
    query=&quot;I need to implement authentication&quot;,
  	mode=&quot;fast&quot;
)
```

Acontext supports `fast` and `agentic` modes for search. The former uses embeddings to match skills. The latter uses an Experience Agent to explore the entire `Space` and tries to cover every skill needed.

The return is a list of sop blocks, which look like below:

```json
{
    &quot;use_when&quot;: &quot;star a github repo&quot;,
    &quot;preferences&quot;: &quot;use personal account. star but not fork&quot;,

# Infrastructure as Code in any Programming Language

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pulumi.com/images/get-started.svg?&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

**Pulumi Infrastructure as Code** is the easiest way to build and deploy infrastructure, of any architecture and on any cloud, using programming languages that you already know and love. Code and ship infrastructure faster with your favorite languages and tools, and embed IaC anywhere with [Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/using-pulumi/automation-api/).

Simply write code in your favorite language and Pulumi automatically provisions and manages your resources on
[AWS](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/aws/),
[Azure](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/azure/),
[Google Cloud Platform](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/gcp/), 
[Kubernetes](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/kubernetes/), and [120+ providers](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/) using an
[infrastructure-as-code](https://www.pulumi.com/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) approach.
Skip the YAML, and use standard language features like loops, functions, classes,
and package management that you already know and love.

For example, create three web servers:

```typescript
const aws = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;);
const sg = new aws.ec2.SecurityGroup(&quot;web-sg&quot;, {
    ingress: [{ protocol: &quot;tcp&quot;, fromPort: 80, toPort: 80, cidrBlocks: [&quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot;] }],
});
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    new aws.ec2.Instance(`web-${i}`, {
        ami: &quot;ami-7172b611&quot;,
        instanceType: &quot;t2.micro&quot;,
        vpcSecurityGroupIds: [sg.id],
        userData: `#!/bin/bash
            echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot; &gt; index.html
            nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &amp;`,
    });
}
```

Or a simple serverless timer that archives Hacker News every day at 8:30AM:

```typescript
const aws = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;);

const snapshots = new aws.dynamodb.Table(&quot;snapshots&quot;, {
    attributes: [{ name: &quot;id&quot;, type: &quot;S&quot;, }],
    hashKey: &quot;id&quot;, billingMode: &quot;PAY_PER_REQUEST&quot;,
});

aws.cloudwatch.onSchedule(&quot;daily-yc-snapshot&quot;, &quot;cron(30 8 * * ? *)&quot;, () =&gt; {
    require(&quot;https&quot;).get(&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;, res =&gt; {
        let content = &quot;&quot;;
        res.setEncoding(&quot;utf8&quot;);
        res.on(&quot;data&quot;, chunk =&gt; content += chunk);
        res.on(&quot;end&quot;, () =&gt; new aws.sdk.DynamoDB.DocumentClient().put({
            TableName: snapshots.name.get(),
            Item: { date: Date.now(), content },
        }).promise());
    }).end();
});
```

Many examples are available spanning containers, serverless, and infrastructure in
[pulumi/examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples).

Pulumi is open source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/LICENSE), supports many languages and clouds, and is easy to extend.  This
repo contains the `pulumi` CLI, language SDKs, and core Pulumi engine, and individual libraries are in their own repos.

## &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Getting Started

[![Watch the video](/youtube_preview_image.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f8KF6UGN7g)

See the [Get Started](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/) guide to quickly get started with
Pulumi on your platform and cloud of choice.

Otherwise, the following steps demonstrate how to deploy your first Pulumi program, using AWS
Serverless Lambdas, in minutes:

1. **Install**:

    To install the latest Pulumi release, run the following (see full
    [installation instructions](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/) for additional installation options):

    ```bash
    $ curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com/ | sh
    ```

2. **Create a Project**:

    After installing, you can get started with the `pulumi new` command:

    ```bash
    $ mkdir pulumi-demo &amp;&amp; cd pulumi-demo
    $ pulumi new hello-aws-javascript
    ```

    The `new` command offers templates for all languages and clouds.  Run it without an argument and it&#039;ll prompt
    you with available projects.  This command created an AWS Serverless Lambda project written in JavaScript.

3. **Deploy to the Cloud**:

    Run `pulumi up` to get your code to the cloud:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    ```

    This makes all cloud resources needed to run your code.  Simply make edits to your project, and subsequent
    `pulumi up`s will compute the minimal diff to deploy your changes.

4. **Use Your Program**:

    Now that your code is deployed, you can interact with it.  In the above example, we can curl the endpoint:

    ```bash
    $ curl $(pulumi stack output url)
    ```

5. **Access the Logs**:

    If you&#039;re using containers or functions, Pulumi&#039;s unified logging command will show all of your logs:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi logs -f
    ```

6. **Destroy your Resources**:

    After you&#039;re done, you can remove all resources created by your program:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi destroy -y
    ```

To learn more, head over to [pulumi.com](https://pulumi.com/) for much more information, including
[tutorials](https://www.pulumi.com/tutorials/), [examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples), and
details of the core Pulumi CLI and [programming model concepts](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/).

## Overview

Hugo is a [static site generator] written in [Go], optimized for speed and designed for flexibility. With its advanced templating system and fast asset pipelines, Hugo renders a complete site in seconds, often less.

Due to its flexible framework, multilingual support, and powerful taxonomy system, Hugo is widely used to create:

- Corporate, government, nonprofit, education, news, event, and project sites
- Documentation sites
- Image portfolios
- Landing pages
- Business, professional, and personal blogs
- Resumes and CVs

Use Hugo&#039;s embedded web server during development to instantly see changes to content, structure, behavior, and presentation. Then deploy the site to your host, or push changes to your Git provider for automated builds and deployment.

Hugo&#039;s fast asset pipelines include:

- Image processing &amp;ndash; Convert, resize, crop, rotate, adjust colors, apply filters, overlay text and images, and extract EXIF data
- JavaScript bundling &amp;ndash; Transpile TypeScript and JSX to JavaScript, bundle, tree shake, minify, create source maps, and perform SRI hashing.
- Sass processing &amp;ndash; Transpile Sass to CSS, bundle, tree shake, minify, create source maps, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with PostCSS
- Tailwind CSS processing &amp;ndash; Compile Tailwind CSS utility classes into standard CSS, bundle, tree shake, optimize, minify, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with PostCSS

And with [Hugo Modules], you can share content, assets, data, translations, themes, templates, and configuration with other projects via public or private Git repositories.

See the [features] section of the documentation for a comprehensive summary of Hugo&#039;s capabilities.

  The most widely deployed gateway in Kubernetes for microservices and AI agents
&lt;/h1&gt;

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/10534/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/10534)

## About kgateway

Kgateway is the most mature and widely deployed gateway in the market today. Built on open source and open standards, **kgateway is a dual control plane that implements the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) for both [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) and [agentgateway](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway)**. This unique architecture enables kgateway to provide unified API connectivity spanning from traditional HTTP/gRPC workloads to advanced AI agent orchestration.

With a control plane that scales from lightweight microgateway deployments between services, to massively parallel centralized gateways handling billions of API calls, to advanced AI gateway use cases for safety, security, and governance, kgateway brings omni-directional API connectivity to any cloud and any environment.

### Use Cases

Kgateway is designed for:

* **Advanced Ingress Controller and Next-Gen API Gateway**: Aggregate web APIs and apply functions like authentication, authorization and rate limiting in one place. Powered by [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) or [agentgateway](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway) and programmed with the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/), kgateway is a world-leading Cloud Native ingress.

* **AI Gateway for LLM Consumption**: Protect models, tools, agents, and data from inappropriate access. Manage traffic to LLM providers, enrich prompts at a system level, and apply prompt guards for safety and compliance.

* **Inference Gateway for Generative Models**: Intelligently route to AI inference workloads in Kubernetes environments utilizing the [Inference Extension](https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/) project.

* **Native MCP and Agent-to-Agent Gateway**: Federate Model Context Protocol tool services and secure agent-to-agent communications with a single scalable endpoint powered by agentgateway.

* **Hybrid Application Migration**: Route to backends implemented as microservices, serverless functions or legacy apps. Gradually migrate from legacy code while maintaining existing systems.

Kgateway is feature-rich, fast, and flexible. It excels in function-level routing, supports legacy apps, microservices and serverless, offers robust discovery capabilities, integrates seamlessly with open-source projects, and is designed to support hybrid applications with various technologies, architectures, protocols, and clouds.

### History

The project was launched in 2018 as **Gloo** by Solo.io and has been [production-ready since 2019](https://www.solo.io/blog/announcing-gloo-1-0-a-production-ready-envoy-based-api-gateway). Since then, it has steadily evolved to become the most trusted and feature-rich API gateway for Kubernetes, processing billions of API requests for many of the world&#039;s biggest companies. Please see [the migration plan](https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway/issues/10363) for more information about the transition from Gloo to kgateway.

&lt;br&gt;

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](https://docs.ollama.com/import) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Generate embeddings from the CLI

```shell
ollama run embeddinggemma &quot;Your text to embed&quot;
```

You can also pipe text for scripted workflows:

```shell
echo &quot;Your text to embed&quot; | ollama run embeddinggemma
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># 🐳 Official Docker MCP Registry

Welcome to the Official Docker MCP (Model Context Protocol) Registry! This repository serves as a curated catalog of MCP servers that can be easily discovered, deployed, and integrated with any MCP Client and compatible with Docker tooling. 

Entries in this catalog will be available at: 
- [MCP catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp) 
- [Docker Desktop&#039;s MCP Toolkit](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 
- [Docker Hub `mcp` namespace](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp) (for MCP servers built by Docker)

## 🤖 What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect with external data sources and tools. Read more at [MCP Official Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## ✨ Why Use the Docker MCP Registry?
- **Enterprise Security**: MCP servers built by Docker include cryptographic signatures, provenance tracking, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) for maximum trust and compliance
- **Container Isolation**: All MCP servers run in isolated containers, protecting your host system from potential security vulnerabilities
- **Curated Quality**: All MCP servers undergo review to ensure they meet quality and security standards
- **Easy Discovery**: Browse and find MCP servers for your specific use cases or share yours to millions of developers using Docker tools
- **Docker Integration**: Seamless deployment with Docker containers

## 🤝 Contributing to the Docker MCP Registry
We welcome contributions to the Official Docker MCP Registry! If you&#039;d like to contribute, you can submit a PR with the metadata information and it will be added to the [MCP catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp), to [Docker Desktop&#039;s MCP Toolkit](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), and (for MCP servers images built by Docker) in `mcp` namespace in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp).

To add your MCP server to the registry, please review the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for detailed instructions. We support two types of submissions:

### 🏗️ Option A: Docker-Built Image (Recommended)
Have Docker build and maintain your server image with enhanced security features. You&#039;ll submit the required information via pull request and upon approval Docker will build, sign, and publish your image to mcp/your-server-name on Docker Hub and the catalog entry will be available in the catalog in 24 hours.

_**Benefits: Your image will include cryptographic signatures, provenance tracking, SBOMs, and automatic security updates**_

### 📦 Option B: Self-Provided Pre-Built Image
In this option, you&#039;ll provide an already built image which will be used directly in the catalog. 

_**Note: Self-built images still benefit from container isolation but won&#039;t include the enhanced security features of Docker-built images.**_

## ✏️ Modifying or Removing Servers
To request modifications or removal of an existing MCP Server please open an issue explaining the reason for the edit/removal.

## ✅ Compliance and Quality Standards
All MCP servers in this registry must:
- Follow security best practices
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Provide working Docker deployment
- Maintain compatibility with MCP standards
- Include proper error handling and logging

_**Non-compliant servers will be reviewed and may be removed from the registry.**_

## What is gVisor?

**gVisor** provides a strong layer of isolation between running applications and
the host operating system. It is an application kernel that implements a
[Linux-like interface][linux]. Unlike Linux, it is written in a memory-safe
language (Go) and runs in userspace.

gVisor includes an [Open Container Initiative (OCI)][oci] runtime called `runsc`
that makes it easy to work with existing container tooling. The `runsc` runtime
integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, making it simple to run sandboxed
containers.

## What **isn&#039;t** gVisor?

*   gVisor is **not a syscall filter** (e.g. `seccomp-bpf`), nor a wrapper over
    Linux isolation primitives (e.g. `firejail`, AppArmor, etc.).
*   gVisor is also **not a VM** in the everyday sense of the term (e.g.
    VirtualBox, QEMU).

**gVisor takes a distinct third approach**, providing many security benefits of
VMs while maintaining the lower resource footprint, fast startup, and
flexibility of regular userspace applications.

## Why does gVisor exist?

Containers are not a [**sandbox**][sandbox]. While containers have
revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications, using them to
run untrusted or potentially malicious code without additional isolation is not
a good idea. While using a single, shared kernel allows for efficiency and
performance gains, it also means that container escape is possible with a single
vulnerability.

gVisor is an application kernel for containers. It limits the host kernel
surface accessible to the application while still giving the application access
to all the features it expects. Unlike most kernels, gVisor does not assume or
require a fixed set of physical resources; instead, it leverages existing host
kernel functionality and runs as a normal process. In other words, gVisor
implements Linux by way of Linux.

gVisor should not be confused with technologies and tools to harden containers
against external threats, provide additional integrity checks, or limit the
scope of access for a service. One should always be careful about what data is
made available to a container.

## Documentation

User documentation and technical architecture, including quick start guides, can
be found at [gvisor.dev][gvisor-dev].

## Installing from source

gVisor builds on x86_64 and ARM64. Other architectures may become available in
the future.

For the purposes of these instructions, [bazel][bazel] and other build
dependencies are wrapped in a build container. It is possible to use
[bazel][bazel] directly, or type `make help` for standard targets.

### Requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

*   Linux 4.14.77+ ([older linux][old-linux])
*   [Docker version 17.09.0 or greater][docker]

### Building

Build and install the `runsc` binary:

```sh
mkdir -p bin
make copy TARGETS=runsc DESTINATION=bin/
sudo cp ./bin/runsc /usr/local/bin
```

To build specific libraries or binaries, you can specify the target:

```sh
make build TARGETS=&quot;//pkg/tcpip:tcpip&quot;
```

### Building directly with Bazel (without Docker)

Using Bazel directly isn&#039;t recommended due to the extra overhead, but in order
to get started:

-   Look at the [build dockerfile](images/default/Dockerfile) for the canonical
    list of needed dependencies.
-   Install and use [bazelisk][bazelisk]. Otherwise, make sure your bazel
    version matches the one listed in the [.bazelversion](.bazelversion) file.

After setting up dependencies, using Bazel is similar to the Makefile:

```sh
bazel build //runsc:runsc
```

### Testing

To run standard test suites, you can use:

```sh
make unit-tests
make tests
```

To run specific tests, you can specify the target:

```sh
# Makefile
make test TARGETS=&quot;//runsc:version_test&quot;
# Bazel
bazel test //runsc:version_test
```

### Mac OS

Some packages support running tests directly on macOS. At the time of this
writing, gVisor requires bazel 8, which you can install via homebrew:

```sh
brew install bazel@8

# You can then run the tests, e.g.:
$(brew --prefix bazel@8)/bin/bazel test --macos_sdk_version=$(xcrun --show-sdk-version) -- //tools/nogo/... //tools/check{aligned,const,escape,linkname,locks,unsafe}/...
```

### Using `go get`

This project uses [bazel][bazel] to build and manage dependencies. A synthetic
`go` branch is maintained that is compatible with standard `go` tooling for
convenience.

For example, to build and install `runsc` directly from this branch:

```sh
echo &quot;module runsc&quot; &gt; go.mod
GO111MODULE=on go get gvisor.dev/gvisor/runsc@go
CGO_ENABLED=0 GO111MODULE=on sudo -E go build -o /usr/local/bin/runsc gvisor.dev/gvisor/runsc
```

Subsequently, you can build and install the shim binary for `containerd`:

```sh
GO111MODULE=on sudo -E go build -o /usr/local/bin/containerd-shim-runsc-v1 gvisor.dev/gvisor/shim
```

Note that this branch is supported in a best effort capacity, and direct
development on this branch is not supported. Development should occur on the
`master` branch, which is then reflected into the `go` branch.

## Community &amp; Governance

See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for project governance information.

The [gvisor-users mailing list][gvisor-users-list] and
[gvisor-dev mailing list][gvisor-dev-list] are good starting points for
questions and discussion.

# MCP Go SDK

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

This repository contains an implementation of the official Go software
development kit (SDK) for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Package / Feature documentation

The SDK consists of several importable packages:

- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp)
  package defines the primary APIs for constructing and using MCP clients and
  servers.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc) package is for users implementing
  their own transports.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth)
  package provides some primitives for supporting OAuth.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex)
  package provides extensions to the OAuth protocol, such as ProtectedResourceMetadata.

The SDK endeavors to implement the full MCP spec. The [`docs/`](/docs/) directory
contains feature documentation, mapping the MCP spec to the packages above.

## Getting started

To get started creating an MCP server, create an `mcp.Server` instance, add
features to it, and then run it over an `mcp.Transport`. For example, this
server adds a single simple tool, and then connects it to clients over
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

type Input struct {
	Name string `json:&quot;name&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the name of the person to greet&quot;`
}

type Output struct {
	Greeting string `json:&quot;greeting&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the greeting to tell to the user&quot;`
}

func SayHi(ctx context.Context, req *mcp.CallToolRequest, input Input) (
	*mcp.CallToolResult,
	Output,
	error,
) {
	return nil, Output{Greeting: &quot;Hi &quot; + input.Name}, nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a server with a single tool.
	server := mcp.NewServer(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;greeter&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)
	mcp.AddTool(server, &amp;mcp.Tool{Name: &quot;greet&quot;, Description: &quot;say hi&quot;}, SayHi)
	// Run the server over stdin/stdout, until the client disconnects.
	if err := server.Run(context.Background(), &amp;mcp.StdioTransport{}); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

To communicate with that server, create an `mcp.Client` and connect it to the
corresponding server, by running the server command and communicating over its
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;os/exec&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Create a new client, with no features.
	client := mcp.NewClient(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;mcp-client&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)

	// Connect to a server over stdin/stdout.
	transport := &amp;mcp.CommandTransport{Command: exec.Command(&quot;myserver&quot;)}
	session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	// Call a tool on the server.
	params := &amp;mcp.CallToolParams{
		Name:      &quot;greet&quot;,
		Arguments: map[string]any{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;you&quot;},
	}
	res, err := session.CallTool(ctx, params)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;CallTool failed: %v&quot;, err)
	}
	if res.IsError {
		log.Fatal(&quot;tool failed&quot;)
	}
	for _, c := range res.Content {
		log.Print(c.(*mcp.TextContent).Text)
	}
}
```

The [`examples/`](/examples/) directory contains more example clients and
servers.

```

### Running in Docker &amp; Docker Compose

Run in console

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name torrserver -p 8090:8090 ghcr.io/yourok/torrserver:latest
```

For running in persistence mode, just mount volume to container by adding `-v ~/ts:/opt/ts`, where `~/ts` folder path is just example, but you could use it anyway... Result example command:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name torrserver -v ~/ts:/opt/ts -p 8090:8090 ghcr.io/yourok/torrserver:latest
```

#### Environments

- `TS_HTTPAUTH` - 1, and place auth file into `~/ts/config` folder for enabling basic auth
- `TS_RDB` - if 1, then the enabling `--rdb` flag
- `TS_DONTKILL` - if 1, then the enabling `--dontkill` flag
- `TS_PORT` - for changind default port to **5555** (example), also u need to change `-p 8090:8090` to `-p 5555:5555` (example)
- `TS_CONF_PATH` - for overriding torrserver config path inside container. Example `/opt/tsss`
- `TS_TORR_DIR` - for overriding torrents directory. Example `/opt/torr_files`
- `TS_LOG_PATH` - for overriding log path. Example `/opt/torrserver.log`

Example with full overrided command (on default values):

```bash
docker run --rm -d -e TS_PORT=5665 -e TS_DONTKILL=1 -e TS_HTTPAUTH=1 -e TS_RDB=1 -e TS_CONF_PATH=/opt/ts/config -e TS_LOG_PATH=/opt/ts/log -e TS_TORR_DIR=/opt/ts/torrents --name torrserver -v ~/ts:/opt/ts -p 5665:5665 ghcr.io/yourok/torrserver:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

```yml
# docker-compose.yml

version: &#039;3.3&#039;
services:
    torrserver:
        image: ghcr.io/yourok/torrserver
        container_name: torrserver
        network_mode: host    # to allow DLNA feature
        environment:
            - TS_PORT=5665
            - TS_DONTKILL=1
            - TS_HTTPAUTH=0
            - TS_CONF_PATH=/opt/ts/config
            - TS_TORR_DIR=/opt/ts/torrents
        volumes:
            - &#039;./CACHE:/opt/ts/torrents&#039;
            - &#039;./CONFIG:/opt/ts/config&#039;
        ports:
            - &#039;5665:5665&#039;
        restart: unless-stopped
        

```

### Smart TV (using Media Station X)

1. Install **Media Station X** on your Smart TV (see [platform support](https://msx.benzac.de/info/?tab=PlatformSupport))

2. Open it and go to: **Settings -&gt; Start Parameter -&gt; Setup**

3. Enter current ip and port of the TorrServe(r), e.g. `127.0.0.1:8090`

## Development

#### Go server

To run the Go server locally, just run

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd
```

#### Web development

To run the web server locally, just run

```bash
yarn start
```

More info at &lt;https://github.com/YouROK/TorrServer/tree/master/web#readme&gt;

### Build

#### Server

- Install [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.20+
- Go to the TorrServer source directory
- Run build script under linux or macOS `build-all.sh`

#### Web

- Install **npm** and **yarn**
- Go to the web directory
- Run `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider yarn build`

#### Android

To build an Android server you will need the Android Toolchain.

#### Swagger

`swag` must be installed on the system to [re]build Swagger documentation.

```bash
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
cd server; swag init -g web/server.go

# Documentation can be linted using
swag fmt
```

## API

### API Docs

API documentation is hosted as Swagger format available at path `/swagger/index.html`.

## Authentication

The users data file should be located near to the settings. Basic auth, read more in wiki &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication&gt;.

`accs.db` in JSON format:

```json
{
    &quot;User1&quot;: &quot;Pass1&quot;,
    &quot;User2&quot;: &quot;Pass2&quot;
}
```

Note: You should enable authentication with -a (--httpauth) TorrServer startup option.

## Whitelist/Blacklist IP

The lists file should be located in the same directory with config.db.

- Whitelist file name: `wip.txt`
- Blacklist file name: `bip.txt`

Whitelist has priority over everything else.

Example:

```text
local:127.0.0.0-127.0.0.255
127.0.0.0-127.0.0.255
local:127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1
# at the beginning of the line, comment
```
