            <h2>README</h2><pre># MCP Registry

A community driven registry service for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Development Status

This project is being built in the open and is currently in the early stages of development. Please see the [overview discussion](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/discussions/11) for the project scope and goals. If you would like to contribute, please check out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Overview

The MCP Registry service provides a centralized repository for MCP server entries. It allows discovery and management of various MCP implementations with their associated metadata, configurations, and capabilities.

## Features

- RESTful API for managing MCP registry entries (list, get, create, update, delete)
- Health check endpoint for service monitoring
- Support for various environment configurations
- Graceful shutdown handling
- MongoDB and in-memory database support
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Pagination support for listing registry entries

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or later
- MongoDB
- Docker (optional, but recommended for development)

## Running

The easiest way to get the registry running is to use `docker compose`. This will setup the MCP Registry service, import the seed data and run MongoDB in a local Docker environment.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t registry .

# Run the registry and MongoDB with docker compose
docker compose up
```

This will start the MCP Registry service and MongoDB with Docker, exposing it on port 8080.

## Building

If you prefer to run the service locally without Docker, you can build and run it directly using Go.

```bash
# Build a registry executable
go build ./cmd/registry
```
This will create the `registry` binary in the current directory. You&#039;ll need to have MongoDB running locally or with Docker.

By default, the service will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI. You can access the interactive Swagger UI at:

```
/v0/swagger/index.html
```

This provides a complete reference of all endpoints with request/response schemas and allows you to test the API directly from your browser.

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

## Introduction

Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.

We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:

* [SSH nodes](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).
* [Kubernetes clusters](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction/)
* [PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/database-access/).
* [Internal Web apps](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/application-access/introduction/).
* [Windows Hosts](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/desktop-access/introduction/).
* [Networked servers](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).

You can set up Teleport as a [Linux daemon](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo) or a [Kubernetes deployment](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/).

Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:

- No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
- Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
- Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.

Teleport uses [Go crypto](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto). It is _fully compatible with OpenSSH_, `sshd` servers, and `ssh` clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.

## Docker

### Deploy Teleport

If you wish to deploy Teleport inside a Docker container see the
[installation guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/#running-teleport-on-docker).

### For Local Testing and Development

To run a full test suite locally, see [the test dependencies list](BUILD_macos.md#local-tests-dependencies)

## Building Teleport

The `teleport` repository contains the Teleport daemon binary (written in Go)
and a web UI written in TypeScript.

If your intention is to build and deploy for use in a production infrastructure
a released tag should be used.  The default branch, `master`, is the current
development branch for an upcoming major version.  Get the latest release tags
listed at https://goteleport.com/download/ and then use that tag in the `git clone`.
For example `git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git -b v16.0.0` gets release v16.0.0.

### Dockerized Build

It is often easiest to build with Docker, which ensures that all required
tooling is available for the build. To execute a dockerized build, ensure
that docker is installed and running, and execute:

```
make -C build.assets build-binaries
```

### Local Build

#### Dependencies

Ensure you have installed correct versions of necessary dependencies:
* `Go` version from
  [go.mod](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/go.mod#L3)
* If you wish to build the Rust-powered features like Desktop Access, see the
  `Rust` and `Cargo` versions in
  [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/Makefile#L21)
  (search for `RUST_VERSION`)
* For `tsh` version &gt; `10.x` with FIDO2 support, you will need `libfido2` and
  `pkg-config` installed locally
* To build the web UI:
  * [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack). If you have Node.js installed, run `corepack enable pnpm` to make `pnpm` available.
  * If you prefer not to install/use pnpm, but have docker available, you can run `make docker-ui` instead.
  * The `Rust` and `Cargo` version in [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/versions.mk#L11) (search for `RUST_VERSION`) are required.
  * The [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) version in [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/versions.mk#L12) (search for `WASM_PACK_VERSION`) is required.
  * [`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) (which contains `wasm-opt`) is required to be installed manually
    on linux aarch64 (64-bit ARM). You can check if it&#039;s already installed on your system by running `which wasm-opt`. If not you can install it like `apt-get install binaryen` (for Debian-based Linux). `wasm-pack` will install this automatically on other platforms.

For an example of Dev Environment setup on a Mac, see [these instructions](BUILD_macos.md).

#### Perform a build

&gt;**Important**
&gt;
&gt;* The Go compiler is somewhat sensitive to the amount of memory: you will need
   **at least** 1GB of virtual memory to compile Teleport. A 512MB instance
   without swap will **not** work.
&gt;* This will build the latest version of Teleport, **regardless** of whether it
   is stable. If you want to build the latest stable release, run `git checkout`
   and `git submodule update --recursive` to the corresponding tag (for example,
&gt;* run `git checkout v8.0.0`) **before** performing a build.

Get the source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git
cd teleport
```

To perform a build

```shell
make full
```

`tsh` dynamically links against libfido2 by default, to support development
environments, as long as the library itself can be found:

```shell
$ brew install libfido2 pkg-config  # Replace with your package manager of choice

$ make build/tsh
&gt; libfido2 found, setting FIDO2=dynamic
&gt; (...)
```

Release binaries are linked statically against libfido2. You may switch the
linking mode using the FIDO2 variable:

```shell
make build/tsh FIDO2=dynamic # dynamic linking
make build/tsh FIDO2=static  # static linking, for an easy setup use `make enter`
                             # or `build.assets/macos/build-fido2-macos.sh`.
make build/tsh FIDO2=off     # doesn&#039;t link libfido2 in any way
```

`tsh` builds with Touch ID support require access to an Apple Developer account.
If you are a Teleport maintainer, ask the team for access.

#### Build output and run locally

If the build succeeds, the installer will place the binaries in the `build` directory.

Before starting, create default data directories:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p -m0700 /var/lib/teleport
sudo chown $USER /var/lib/teleport
```

#### Running Teleport in a hot reload mode

To speed up your development process, you can run Teleport using
[`CompileDaemon`](https://github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon). This will build
and run the Teleport binary, and then rebuild and restart it whenever any Go
source files change.

1. Install CompileDaemon:

    ```shell
    go install github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon@latest
    ```

    Note that we use `go install` instead of the suggested `go get`, because we
    don&#039;t want CompileDaemon to become a dependency of the project.

1. Build and run the Teleport binary:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload
    ```

    By default, this runs a `teleport start` command. If you want to customize
    the command, for example by providing a custom config file location, you can
    use the `TELEPORT_ARGS` parameter:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload TELEPORT_ARGS=&#039;start --config=/path/to/config.yaml&#039;
    ```

Note that you still need to run [`make grpc`](api/proto/README.md) if you modify
any Protocol Buffers files to regenerate the generated Go sources; regenerating
these sources should in turn cause the CompileDaemon to rebuild and restart
Teleport.

### Web UI

The Teleport Web UI resides in the [web](web) directory.

#### Rebuilding Web UI for development

To rebuild the Teleport UI package, run the following command:

```bash
make docker-ui
```

Then you can replace Teleport Web UI files with the files from the newly-generated `/dist` folder.

To enable speedy iterations on the Web UI, you can run a [local web-dev server](web#web-ui).

You can also tell Teleport to load the Web UI assets from the source directory.
To enable this behavior, set the environment variable `DEBUG=1` and rebuild with the default target:

```bash
# Run Teleport as a single-node cluster in development mode:
DEBUG=1 ./build/teleport start -d
```

Keep the server running in this mode, and make your UI changes in `/dist` directory.
For instructions about how to update the Web UI, read [the `web` README](web#readme).

### Managing dependencies

All dependencies are managed using [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules). Here are the instructions for some common tasks:

#### Add a new dependency

Latest version:

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency
```

and update the source to use this dependency.


To get a specific version, use `go get github.com/new/dependency@version` instead.

#### Set dependency to a specific version

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency@version
```

#### Update dependency to the latest version

```bash
go get -u github.com/new/dependency
```

#### Update all dependencies

```bash
go get -u all
```

#### Debugging dependencies

Why is a specific package imported?

`go mod why $pkgname`

Why is a specific module imported?

`go mod why -m $modname`

Why is a specific version of a module imported?

`go mod graph | grep $modname`

### Devbox Build (experimental)

**Note**: Devbox support is still experimental. It&#039;s very possible things may not work as intended.

Teleport can be built using [devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox). To use devbox, follow
the instructions to install devbox [here](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/docs/quickstart/) and
then run:

`devbox shell`

This will install Teleport&#039;s various build dependencies and drop you into a shell with these
dependencies. From here, you can build Teleport normally.

#### flake.nix

A nix flake is located in `build.assets/flake` that allows for installation of Teleport&#039;s less
common build tooling. If this flake is updated, run:

`devbox install`

in order to make sure the changes in the flake are reflected in the local devbox shell.

## Why did We Build Teleport?

The Teleport creators used to work together at Rackspace. We noticed that most cloud computing users struggle with setting up and configuring infrastructure security because popular tools, while flexible, are complex to understand and expensive to maintain. Additionally, most organizations use multiple infrastructure form factors such as several cloud providers, multiple cloud accounts, servers in colocation, and even smart devices. Some of those devices run on untrusted networks, behind third-party firewalls. This only magnifies complexity and increases operational overhead.

We had a choice, either start a security consulting business or build a solution that&#039;s dead-easy to use and understand. A real-time representation of all of your servers in the same room as you, as if they were magically _teleported_. Thus, Teleport was born!

## Introduction

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3713a774-1b3a-41f9-8e9d-9331bbf8acac&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Kubetail&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

**Kubetail** is a general-purpose logging dashboard for Kubernetes, optimized for tailing logs across across multi-container workloads in real-time. With Kubetail, you can view logs from all the containers in a workload (e.g. Deployment or DaemonSet) merged into a single, chronological timeline, delivered to your browser or terminal.

The primary entry point for Kubetail is the `kubetail` CLI tool, which can launch a local web dashboard on your desktop or stream raw logs directly to your terminal. Behind the scenes, Kubetail uses your cluster&#039;s Kubernetes API to fetch logs directly from your cluster, so it works out of the box without needing to forward your logs to an external service first. Kubetail also uses your Kubernetes API to track container lifecycle events in order to keep your log timeline in sync as containers start, stop or get replaced. This makes it easy to follow logs seamlessly as user requests move from one ephemeral container to another across services.

Our goal is to build the most powerful, user-friendly logging platform for Kubernetes and we&#039;d love your input. If you notice a bug or have a suggestion please create a GitHub Issue or send us an email (hello@kubetail.com)!

## Features

* Clean, easy-to-use interface
* View log messages in real-time
* Filter logs by:
  * Workload (e.g. Deployment, CronJob, StatefulSet)
  * Absolute or relative time range
  * Node properties (e.g. availability zone, CPU architecture, node ID)
  * Grep 
* Uses your Kubernetes API to retrieve log messages so data never leaves your possession (private by default)
* Web dashboard can be installed on desktop or in cluster
* Switch between multiple clusters (Desktop-only)

## Quickstart (Desktop)

### Option 1: Package Managers

First, install the Kubetail CLI tool (`kubetail`) via your favorite package manager:

```console
# Homebrew
brew install kubetail

# Winget
winget install Kubetail.Kubetail

# Chocolatey
choco install kubetail
```

Next, start the web dashboard using the `serve` subcommand:

```console
kubetail serve
```

This command will open [http://localhost:7500/](http://localhost:7500/) in your default browser. Have fun tailing your logs!

### Option 2: Shell

First, download and run the install script:

```console
curl -sS https://www.kubetail.com/install.sh | bash
```

Next, start the web dashboard using the `serve` subcommand:

```console
kubetail serve
```

This command will open [http://localhost:7500/](http://localhost:7500/) in your default browser. Have fun tailing your logs!

### Option 3: Binaries

Download the binary for your OS/Arch (from the latest [release binaries](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest)):

* Darwin ([amd64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-darwin-amd64), [arm64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-darwin-arm64))
* Linux ([amd64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-linux-amd64), [arm64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-linux-arm64))
* Windows ([amd64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-windows-amd64), [arm64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-windows-arm64))

Rename the file and make it executable:

```console
mv &lt;filename&gt; kubetail
chmod a+x kubetail
```

Next, start the web dashboard using the `serve` subcommand:

```console
kubetail serve
```

This command will open [http://localhost:7500/](http://localhost:7500/) in your default browser. Have fun tailing your logs!

## Quickstart (Cluster)

### Option 1: Helm

First, add the Kubetail org&#039;s chart repository, then install the &quot;kubetail&quot; chart:

```console
helm repo add kubetail https://kubetail-org.github.io/helm-charts/
helm install kubetail kubetail/kubetail --namespace kubetail-system --create-namespace
```

For more information on how to configure the helm chart, see the chart&#039;s [values.yaml](https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kubetail/values.yaml) file.

To access the web dashboard you can expose it as an ingress using the chart or you can use your usual access methods such as `kubectl port-forward`:

```console
kubectl port-forward -n kubetail-system svc/kubetail-dashboard 8080:8080
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Have fun tailing your logs!

### Option 2: YAML Manifest

First, create a namespace for the Kubetail resources:

```console
kubectl create namespace kubetail-system
```

Next, choose your authentication mode (`cluster` or `token`) and apply the latest manifest file:

```console
# For cluster-based authentication use kubetail-clusterauth.yaml:
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-clusterauth.yaml

# For token-based authentication use kubetail-tokenauth.yaml:
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-tokenauth.yaml
```

To access the web dashboard you can use your usual access methods such as `kubectl port-forward`:

```console
kubectl port-forward -n kubetail-system svc/kubetail-dashboard 8080:8080
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Have fun tailing your logs!

### Option 3: Glasskube

To install Kubetail using [Glasskube](https://glasskube.dev/), you can select &quot;Kubetail&quot; from the &quot;ClusterPackages&quot; tab in the Glasskube GUI then click &quot;install&quot; or you can run the following command:

```console
glasskube install kubetail
```

Once Kubetail is installed you can use it by clicking &quot;open&quot; in the Glasskube GUI or by using the `open` command:

```console
glasskube open kubetail
```

Have fun tailing your logs!

## Roadmap and Status

This is our high-level plan for the Kubetail project, in order:

|   | Step                                                  | Status |
| - | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1 | Real-time container logs                              | ✅     |
| 2 | Real-time search and polished user experience         | 🛠️     |
| 3 | Real-time system logs (e.g. systemd, k8s events)      | 🔲     |
| 4 | Basic customizability (e.g. colors, time formats)     | 🔲     |
| 5 | Message parsing and metrics                           | 🔲     |
| 6 | Historic data (e.g. log archives, metrics timeseries) | 🔲     |
| 7 | Kubetail API and developer-facing client libraries    | 🔲     |
| N | World Peace                                           | 🔲     |

And here are some additional details:

**Real-time container logs**

Users can view the container logs from the pods currently running inside their clusters quickly and easily using a web dashboard. Users can view container logs organized by workloads and follow log messages as ephemeral containers get created and deleted. They can also narrow their viewing window by timestamp and filter logs by source properties such as region, zone and node.

**Real-time search and polished user experience**

Users can install Kubetail easily on their desktops and in their clusters. By default, Kubetail will use only the Kubernetes API to fetch basic data such as running workloads and container logs. If a user wants more advanced functionality they can install Kubetail custom services in their cluster (i.e. &quot;Kubetail Cluster API&quot; and &quot;Kubetail Cluster Agent&quot;, collectively known as the &quot;Kubetail API&quot;) and gain access to features such as log search, log file sizes and last event timestamps. The entire experience of installing, upgrading and uninstalling the Kubetail API is very polished and users are able to view their logs with equally powerful tools in the browser and the terminal using the Kubetail web dashboard and CLI tool.

**Real-time system logs**

Users who install the Kubetail API gain immediate access to their node-level logs (e.g. systemd) and cluster-level logs (e.g. kubernetes events) and view them in an integrated interface that shows their container logs in context with other system information such as CPU utilization, memory usage and disk space. System logs are viewable in real-time, in the same merged timeline with other logs. Users can filter system logs by timestamp and source properties.

**Basic customizability**

Users can fully customize their Kubetail experience when using the web dashboard and CLI tool by modifying their user settings. The user settings are modifiable by hand using a config file or via the dashboard UI. The experience is very polished and works seamlessly across upgrades that may add/remove/modify user settings. Users have the option to sync their settings across multiple devices.

## Development

### Repository Structure

This monorepo contains the following modules:

* Kubetail CLI ([modules/cli](modules/cli))
* Kubetail Cluster API ([modules/cluster-api](modules/cluster-api))
* Kubetail Cluster Agent ([modules/cluster-agent](modules/cluster-agent))
* Kubetail Dashboard ([modules/dashboard](modules/dashboard))

It also contains the source code for the Kubetail Dashboard&#039;s frontend and the Rust binary that powers log search:

* Dashboard UI ([dashboard-ui](dashboard-ui))
* rgkl ([crates/rgkl](crates/rgkl))

### Setting up the Development Environment

#### Dependencies

* [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/)
* [Go](https://go.dev/)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
* [ctlptl](https://github.com/tilt-dev/ctlptl) (optional)

#### Next steps

1. Create a Kubernetes Dev Cluster

```console
ctlptl apply -f hack/ctlptl/minikube.yaml
```

You can use any type of cluster that [works with Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/choosing_clusters.html).

2. Start the dev environment:

```console
tilt up
```

3. Start the Dashboard server:

```console
cd modules/dashboard
go run cmd/main.go -c hack/config.yaml
```

4. Run the Dashboard UI locally:

```console
cd dashboard-ui
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Now access the dashboard at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Optimize Development Environment for Rust (Optional)

By default, the dev environment compiles &quot;release&quot; builds of the Rust components when you run run `tilt up`. If you want to iterate more quickly, you can have Tilt compile the rust code locally using &quot;debug&quot; builds instead.

#### Dependencies

* [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
* [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/installation/)

#### Next steps

First, install the Rust target required for your architecture:

```console
# x86_64
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# aarch64
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Next, install the tools required by Rust cross compiler:

```console
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross

# Linux (Ubuntu)
apt-get install musl-tools
```

On macOS, add this to your `~/.cargo/config.toml` file:

```
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = &quot;x86_64-linux-musl-gcc&quot;

[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = &quot;aarch64-linux-musl-gcc&quot;
```

Finally, to use the local compiler, just run Tilt using using the `KUBETAIL_DEV_RUST_LOCAL` env flag:

```console
KUBETAIL_DEV_RUST_LOCAL=true tilt up
```

## Build

# Beats - The Lightweight Shippers of the Elastic Stack

The [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats) are lightweight data
shippers, written in Go, that you install on your servers to capture all sorts
of operational data (think of logs, metrics, or network packet data). The Beats
send the operational data to Elasticsearch, either directly or via Logstash, so
it can be visualized with Kibana.

By &quot;lightweight&quot;, we mean that Beats have a small installation footprint, use
limited system resources, and have no runtime dependencies.

This repository contains
[libbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/libbeat), our Go
framework for creating Beats, and all the officially supported Beats:

Beat  | Description
--- | ---
[Auditbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/auditbeat) | Collect your Linux audit framework data and monitor the integrity of your files.
[Filebeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/filebeat) | Tails and ships log files
[Heartbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/heartbeat) | Ping remote services for availability
[Metricbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/metricbeat) | Fetches sets of metrics from the operating system and services
[Packetbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/packetbeat) | Monitors the network and applications by sniffing packets
[Winlogbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/winlogbeat) | Fetches and ships Windows Event logs
[Osquerybeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/x-pack/osquerybeat) | Runs Osquery and manages interraction with it.

In addition to the above Beats, which are officially supported by
[Elastic](https://elastic.co), the community has created a set of other Beats
that make use of libbeat but live outside of this Github repository. We maintain
a list of community Beats
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/master/community-beats.html).

# Loki: like Prometheus, but for logs.

Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate.
It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

Compared to other log aggregation systems, Loki:

- does not do full text indexing on logs. By storing compressed, unstructured logs and only indexing metadata, Loki is simpler to operate and cheaper to run.
- indexes and groups log streams using the same labels you’re already using with Prometheus, enabling you to seamlessly switch between metrics and logs using the same labels that you’re already using with Prometheus.
- is an especially good fit for storing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Pod logs. Metadata such as Pod labels is automatically scraped and indexed.
- has native support in Grafana (needs Grafana v6.0).

A Loki-based logging stack consists of 3 components:

- [Alloy](https://github.com/grafana/alloy) is agent, responsible for gathering logs and sending them to Loki.
- [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) is the main service, responsible for storing logs and processing queries.
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) for querying and displaying the logs.

**Note that Alloy replaced Promtail in the stack, because Promtail is considered to be feature complete, and future development for logs collection will be in [Grafana Alloy](https://github.com/grafana/alloy).**

Loki is like Prometheus, but for logs: we prefer a multidimensional label-based approach to indexing, and want a single-binary, easy to operate system with no dependencies.
Loki differs from Prometheus by focusing on logs instead of metrics, and delivering logs via push, instead of pull.

### Building from source

Loki can be run in a single host, no-dependencies mode using the following commands.

You need an up-to-date version of [Go](https://go.dev/), we recommend using the version found in our [Makefile](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/Makefile)

```bash
# Checkout source code
$ git clone https://github.com/grafana/loki
$ cd loki

# Build binary
$ go build ./cmd/loki

# Run executable
$ ./loki -config.file=./cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
```

Alternatively, on Unix systems you can use `make` to build the binary, which adds additional arguments to the `go build` command.

```bash
# Build binary
$ make loki

# Run executable
$ ./cmd/loki/loki -config.file=./cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
```

To build Promtail on non-Linux platforms, use the following command:

```bash
$ go build ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

On Linux, Promtail requires the systemd headers to be installed if
Journal support is enabled.
To enable Journal support the go build tag flag `promtail_journal_enabled` should be passed

With Journal support on Ubuntu, run with the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt install -y libsystemd-dev
$ go build --tags=promtail_journal_enabled ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

With Journal support on CentOS, run with the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo yum install -y systemd-devel
$ go build --tags=promtail_journal_enabled ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

Otherwise, to build Promtail without Journal support, run `go build`
with CGO disabled:

```bash
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

## Documentation

Please see the Syncthing [documentation site][6] [[source]][17].

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TypeScript 7

[Not sure what this is? Read the announcement post!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)

## Preview

A preview build is available on npm as `@typescript/native-preview`.

```sh
npm install @typescript/native-preview
npx tsgo # Use this as you would tsc.
```

A preview VS Code extension is [available on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.native-preview).

To use this, set this in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    &quot;typescript.experimental.useTsgo&quot;: true
}
```

## How to Build and Run

This repo uses [Go 1.24 or higher](https://go.dev/dl/), [Rust 1.85 or higher](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/), and [`hereby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hereby).

For tests and code generation, this repo contains a git submodule to the main TypeScript repo pointing to the commit being ported.
When cloning, you&#039;ll want to clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go.git
```

If you have already cloned the repo, you can initialize the submodule with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

With the submodule in place and `npm ci`, you can run tasks via `hereby`, similar to the TypeScript repo:

```sh
hereby build          # Verify that the project builds
hereby test           # Run all tests
hereby install-tools  # Install additional tools such as linters
hereby lint           # Run all linters
hereby format         # Format all code
hereby generate       # Generate all Go code (e.g. diagnostics, committed to repo)
```

Additional tasks are a work in progress.

`hereby` is not required to work on the repo; the regular `go` tooling (e.g., `go build`, `go test ./...`) will work as expected.
`hereby` tasks are provided as a convenience for those familiar with the TypeScript repo.

### Running `tsgo`

After running `hereby build`, you can run `built/local/tsgo`, which behaves mostly the same as `tsc`.

### Running LSP Prototype

To debug and run the VS Code extension without installing it globally:

* Run VS Code in the repo workspace (`code .`)
* Copy `.vscode/launch.template.json` to `.vscode/launch.json`
* &lt;kbd&gt;F5&lt;/kbd&gt; (or `Debug: Start Debugging` from the command palette)

This will launch a new VS Code instance which uses the Corsa LS as the backend. If correctly set up, you should see &quot;tsgo&quot; in the status bar when a TypeScript or JavaScript file is open:

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Entry point slightly different for now |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS5.8 |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently (in progress) |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JS Doc | not ready | - |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | not ready | Coming soon |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking |
| Build mode / project references | not ready | - |
| Incremental build | not ready | - |
| Language service (LSP) | prototype | Minimal functionality (errors, hover, go to def). More features coming soon |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TinyGo - Go compiler for small places

[![Linux](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/linux.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/linux.yml) [![macOS](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/build-macos.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/build-macos.yml) [![Windows](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/windows.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/windows.yml) [![Docker](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/docker.yml) [![Nix](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/nix.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/nix.yml) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/tinygo-org/tinygo/tree/dev.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/tinygo-org/tinygo/tree/dev)

TinyGo is a Go compiler intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (wasm/wasi), and command-line tools.

It reuses libraries used by the [Go language tools](https://golang.org/pkg/go/) alongside [LLVM](http://llvm.org) to provide an alternative way to compile programs written in the Go programming language.

## Embedded

Here is an example program that blinks the built-in LED when run directly on any supported board with onboard LED:

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;machine&quot;
    &quot;time&quot;
)

func main() {
    led := machine.LED
    led.Configure(machine.PinConfig{Mode: machine.PinOutput})
    for {
        led.Low()
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)

        led.High()
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)
    }
}
```

The above program can be compiled and run without modification on an Arduino Uno, an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or any of the supported boards that have a built-in LED, just by setting the correct TinyGo compiler target. For example, this compiles and flashes an Arduino Uno:

```shell
tinygo flash -target arduino examples/blinky1
```

## WebAssembly

TinyGo is very useful for compiling programs both for use in browsers (WASM) as well as for use on servers and other edge devices (WASI).

TinyGo programs can run in [Fastly Compute](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/guides/compute/go/), [Fermyon Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/go-components), [wazero](https://wazero.io/languages/tinygo/) and many other WebAssembly runtimes.

Here is a small TinyGo program for use by a WASI host application:

```go
package main

//go:wasmexport add
func add(x, y uint32) uint32 {
	return x + y
}
```

This compiles the above TinyGo program for use on any WASI Preview 1 runtime:

```shell
tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared -o add.wasm -target=wasip1 add.go
```

You can also use the same syntax as Go 1.24+:

```shell
GOARCH=wasip1 GOOS=wasm tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared -o add.wasm add.go
```

## Installation

See the [getting started instructions](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/) for information on how to install TinyGo, as well as how to run the TinyGo compiler using our Docker container.

## Supported targets

### Embedded

You can compile TinyGo programs for over 94 different microcontroller boards.

For more information, please see https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/microcontrollers/

### WebAssembly

TinyGo programs can be compiled for both WASM and WASI targets.

For more information, see https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/webassembly/

### Operating Systems

You can also compile programs for Linux, macOS, and Windows targets.

For more information:

- Linux https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/linux/

- macOS https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/macos/

- Windows https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/windows/

## Currently supported features:

For a description of currently supported Go language features, please see [https://tinygo.org/lang-support/](https://tinygo.org/lang-support/).

## Getting help

If you&#039;re looking for a more interactive way to discuss TinyGo usage or
development, we have a [#TinyGo channel](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/CDJD3SUP6/)
on the [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com).

If you need an invitation for the Gophers Slack, you can generate one here which
should arrive fairly quickly (under 1 min): https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org

## Contributing

Your contributions are welcome!

Please take a look at our [Contributing](https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/contributing/) page on our web site for details.

## Project Scope

Goals:

* Have very small binary sizes. Don&#039;t pay for what you don&#039;t use.
* Support for most common microcontroller boards.
* Be usable on the web using WebAssembly.
* Good CGo support, with no more overhead than a regular function call.
* Support most standard library packages and compile most Go code without modification.

Non-goals:

* Be efficient while using zillions of goroutines. However, good goroutine support is certainly a goal.
* Be as fast as `gc`. However, LLVM will probably be better at optimizing certain things so TinyGo might actually turn out to be faster for number crunching.
* Be able to compile every Go program out there.

## Why this project exists

&gt; We never expected Go to be an embedded language and so its got serious problems...

-- Rob Pike, [GopherCon 2014 Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoS7DsT1rdM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2799)

TinyGo is a project to bring Go to microcontrollers and small systems with a single processor core. It is similar to [emgo](https://github.com/ziutek/emgo) but a major difference is that we want to keep the Go memory model (which implies garbage collection of some sort). Another difference is that TinyGo uses LLVM internally instead of emitting C, which hopefully leads to smaller and more efficient code and certainly leads to more flexibility.

The original reasoning was: if [Python](https://micropython.org/) can run on microcontrollers, then certainly [Go](https://golang.org/) should be able to run on even lower level micros.

#### [News](https://fleetdm.com/announcements) &amp;nbsp; · &amp;nbsp; [Report a bug](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new) &amp;nbsp; · &amp;nbsp; [Handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) &amp;nbsp; · &amp;nbsp; [Why open source?](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source) &amp;nbsp; · &amp;nbsp; [Art](https://fleetdm.com/logos)


Open-source platform for IT and security teams with thousands of computers.  Designed for APIs, GitOps, webhooks, YAML, and humans.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://fleetdm.com/logos&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/assets/618009/f835ec29-1cb9-49ba-a0f3-395ffd9d5c9f&quot; alt=&quot;A glass city in the clouds&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


## What&#039;s it for?
Organizations like Fastly and Gusto use Fleet for vulnerability reporting, detection engineering, device management (MDM), device health monitoring, posture-based access control, managing unused software licenses, and more.

#### Explore data
To see what kind of data you can use Fleet to gather, check out the [table reference documentation](https://fleetdm.com/tables).

#### Out-of-the-box policies
Fleet includes out-of-the box support for all [CIS benchmarks for macOS and Windows](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/cis-benchmarks), as well as many [simpler queries](https://fleetdm.com/queries).

Take as much or as little as you need for your organization.

#### Supported platforms
Here are the platforms Fleet currently supports:

- Linux (all distros)
- macOS
- Windows
- Chromebooks
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud (GCP)
- Azure (Microsoft cloud)
- Data centers
- Containers (kube, etc)
- Linux-based IoT devices

## Lighter than air
Fleet is lightweight and modular.  You can use it for security without using it for MDM, and vice versa.  You can turn off features you are not using.

#### Openness
Fleet is dedicated to flexibility, accessibility, and clarity.  We think [everyone can contribute](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#openness) and that tools should be as easy as possible for everyone to understand.

#### Good neighbors
Fleet has no ambition to replace all of your other tools.  (Though it might replace some, if you want it to.)  Ready-to-use, enterprise-friendly integrations exist for Snowflake, Splunk, GitHub Actions, Vanta, Elastic Jira, Zendesk, and more.

Fleet plays well with Munki, Chef, Puppet, and Ansible, as well as with security tools like Crowdstrike and SentinelOne.  For example, you can use the free version of Fleet to quickly report on what hosts are _actually_ running your EDR agent.

#### Free as in free
The free version of Fleet will [always be free](https://fleetdm.com/pricing).  Fleet is [independently backed](https://linkedin.com/company/fleetdm) and actively maintained with the help of many amazing [contributors](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors).

#### Longevity
The [company behind Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) is founded (and majority-owned) by [true believers in open source](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source).  The company&#039;s business model is influenced by GitLab (NYSE: GTLB), with great investors, happy customers, and the capacity to become profitable at any time.

In keeping with Fleet&#039;s value of openness, [Fleet Device Management&#039;s company handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) is public and open source.  You can read about the [history of Fleet and osquery](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#history) and our commitment to improving the product.

&lt;!-- &gt; To upgrade from Fleet ≤3.2.0, just follow the upgrading steps for the earliest subsequent major release from this repository (it&#039;ll work out of the box until the release of Fleet 5.0). --&gt;


## Is it any good?
Fleet is used in production by IT and security teams with thousands of laptops and servers.  Many deployments support tens of thousands of hosts, and a few large organizations manage deployments as large as 400,000+ hosts.



## Chat
Please join us in [MacAdmins Slack](https://www.macadmins.org/) or in [osquery Slack](https://fleetdm.com/slack).

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields based on tags.

It has the following **unique** features:

-   Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or custom validators.
-   Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a multidimensional field to be validated.
-   Ability to dive into both map keys and values for validation
-   Handles type interface by determining it&#039;s underlying type prior to validation.
-   Handles custom field types such as sql driver Valuer see [Valuer](https://golang.org/src/database/sql/driver/types.go?s=1210:1293#L29)
-   Alias validation tags, which allows for mapping of several validations to a single tag for easier defining of validations on structs
-   Extraction of custom defined Field Name e.g. can specify to extract the JSON name while validating and have it available in the resulting FieldError
-   Customizable i18n aware error messages.
-   Default validator for the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework; upgrading from v8 to v9 in gin see [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/master/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding)

A Call for Maintainers
----------------------

Please read the discussiong started [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/discussions/1330) if you are interested in contributing/helping maintain this package.

Installation
------------

Use go get.

	go get github.com/go-playground/validator/v10

Then import the validator package into your own code.

	import &quot;github.com/go-playground/validator/v10&quot;

Error Return Value
-------

Validation functions return type error

They return type error to avoid the issue discussed in the following, where err is always != nil:

* http://stackoverflow.com/a/29138676/3158232
* https://github.com/go-playground/validator/issues/134

Validator returns only InvalidValidationError for bad validation input, nil or ValidationErrors as type error; so, in your code all you need to do is check if the error returned is not nil, and if it&#039;s not check if error is InvalidValidationError ( if necessary, most of the time it isn&#039;t ) type cast it to type ValidationErrors like so:

```go
err := validate.Struct(mystruct)
validationErrors := err.(validator.ValidationErrors)
 ```

Usage and documentation
------

Please see https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 for detailed usage docs.

##### Examples:

- [Simple](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/simple/main.go)
- [Custom Field Types](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/custom/main.go)
- [Struct Level](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/struct-level/main.go)
- [Translations &amp; Custom Errors](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/translations/main.go)
- [Gin upgrade and/or override validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/v9/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding)
- [wash - an example application putting it all together](https://github.com/bluesuncorp/wash)

Baked-in Validations
------

### Special Notes:
- If new to using validator it is highly recommended to initialize it using the `WithRequiredStructEnabled` option which is opt-in to new behaviour that will become the default behaviour in v11+. See documentation for more details.
```go
validate := validator.New(validator.WithRequiredStructEnabled())
```

## What is frp?

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone&#039;s needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh1&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-a.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh2&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-b.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-a.example.com`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-b.example.com`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhostHTTPSPort`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;web&quot;
  type = &quot;http&quot;
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = [&quot;www.example.com&quot;]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;dns&quot;
  type = &quot;udp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  unixPath = &quot;/var/run/docker.sock&quot;
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_static_file&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;static_file&quot;
  localPath = &quot;/tmp/files&quot;
  stripPrefix = &quot;static&quot;
  httpUser = &quot;abc&quot;
  httpPassword = &quot;abc&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `localAddr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_https2http&quot;
  type = &quot;https&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;test.example.com&quot;]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;https2http&quot;
  localAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:80&quot;
  crtPath = &quot;./server.crt&quot;
  keyPath = &quot;./server.key&quot;
  hostHeaderRewrite = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = &quot;frp&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `secretKey` field for the preshared key, and that the `remotePort` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`secretKey` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn&#039;t work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

These configuration files is for reference only. Please do not use this configuration directly to run the program as it may have various issues.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps_full_example.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc_full_example.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go&#039;s standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}&quot;
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}&quot;
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remember to prefix your reference with `.Envs`.

### Split Configures Into Different Files

You can split multiple proxy configs into different files and include them in the main file.

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
serverPort = 7000
includes = [&quot;./confd/*.toml&quot;]
```

```toml
# ./confd/test.toml

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = 6000
```

### Server Dashboard

Check frp&#039;s status and proxies&#039; statistics information by Dashboard.

Configure a port for dashboard to enable this feature:

```toml
# The default value is 127.0.0.1. Change it to 0.0.0.0 when you want to access it from a public network.
webServer.addr = &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;
webServer.port = 7500
# dashboard&#039;s username and password are both optional
webServer.user = &quot;admin&quot;
webServer.password = &quot;admin&quot;
```

Then visit `http://[serverAddr]:7500` to see the dashboard, with username and password both being `admin`.

Additionally, you can use HTTPS port by using your domains wildcard or normal SSL certificate:

```toml
webServer.port = 7500
# dashboard&#039;s username and password are both optional
webSe

Cobra is a library for creating powerful modern CLI applications.

Cobra is used in many Go projects such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) to
name a few. [This list](site/content/projects_using_cobra.md) contains a more extensive list of projects using Cobra.

# Overview

Cobra is a library providing a simple interface to create powerful modern CLI
interfaces similar to git &amp; go tools.

Cobra provides:
* Easy subcommand-based CLIs: `app server`, `app fetch`, etc.
* Fully POSIX-compliant flags (including short &amp; long versions)
* Nested subcommands
* Global, local and cascading flags
* Intelligent suggestions (`app srver`... did you mean `app server`?)
* Automatic help generation for commands and flags
* Grouping help for subcommands
* Automatic help flag recognition of `-h`, `--help`, etc.
* Automatically generated shell autocomplete for your application (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
* Automatically generated man pages for your application
* Command aliases so you can change things without breaking them
* The flexibility to define your own help, usage, etc.
* Optional seamless integration with [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for 12-factor apps

# Concepts

Cobra is built on a structure of commands, arguments &amp; flags.

**Commands** represent actions, **Args** are things and **Flags** are modifiers for those actions.

The best applications read like sentences when used, and as a result, users
intuitively know how to interact with them.

The pattern to follow is
`APPNAME VERB NOUN --ADJECTIVE`
    or
`APPNAME COMMAND ARG --FLAG`.

A few good real world examples may better illustrate this point.

In the following example, &#039;server&#039; is a command, and &#039;port&#039; is a flag:

    hugo server --port=1313

In this command we are telling Git to clone the url bare.

    git clone URL --bare

## Commands

Command is the central point of the application. Each interaction that
the application supports will be contained in a Command. A command can
have children commands and optionally run an action.

In the example above, &#039;server&#039; is the command.

[More about cobra.Command](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra#Command)

## Flags

A flag is a way to modify the behavior of a command. Cobra supports
fully POSIX-compliant flags as well as the Go [flag package](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/).
A Cobra command can define flags that persist through to children commands
and flags that are only available to that command.

In the example above, &#039;port&#039; is the flag.

Flag functionality is provided by the [pflag
library](https://github.com/spf13/pflag), a fork of the flag standard library
which maintains the same interface while adding POSIX compliance.

# Installing
Using Cobra is easy. First, use `go get` to install the latest version
of the library.

```
go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra@latest
```

Next, include Cobra in your application:

```go
import &quot;github.com/spf13/cobra&quot;
```

# Usage
`cobra-cli` is a command line program to generate cobra applications and command files.
It will bootstrap your application scaffolding to rapidly
develop a Cobra-based application. It is the easiest way to incorporate Cobra into your application.

It can be installed by running:

```
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

For complete details on using the Cobra-CLI generator, please read [The Cobra Generator README](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/blob/main/README.md)

## Quickstart

To run and chat with [Llama 3.2](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2):

```shell
ollama run llama3.2
```

## Model library

Ollama supports a list of models available on [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library &#039;ollama model library&#039;)

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

Transactions span multiple nodes, and TiDB&#039;s distributed nature ensures data correctness even in the presence of network partitions or node failures.

- **[Horizontal and Vertical Scalability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/scale-tidb-using-tiup?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes or vertically by increasing resources of existing nodes, all without downtime. TiDB&#039;s architecture separates computing from storage, enabling you to adjust both independently as needed for flexibility and growth.

- **[High Availability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/high-availability-with-multi-az?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Built-in Raft consensus protocol ensures reliability and automated failover. Data is stored in multiple replicas, and transactions are committed only after writing to the majority of replicas, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability, even if some replicas fail. Geographic placement of replicas can be configured for different disaster tolerance levels.

- **[Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP)](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/htap-demystified-defining-modern-data-architecture-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB provides two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. The TiDB Server coordinates query execution across both TiKV and TiFlash to optimize performance.

- **[Cloud-Native](https://www.pingcap.com/cloud-native?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be deployed in public clouds, on-premises, or natively in Kubernetes. [TiDB Operator](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) helps manage TiDB on Kubernetes, automating cluster operations, while [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) provides a fully-managed service for easy and economical deployment, allowing users to set up clusters with just a few clicks.

- **[MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/mysql-compatibility?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB is compatible with MySQL 8.0, allowing you to use familiar protocols, frameworks and tools. You can migrate applications to TiDB without changing any code, or with minimal modifications. Additionally, TiDB provides a suite of [data migration tools](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/ecosystem-tool-user-guide?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) to help easily migrate application data into TiDB.

- **[Open Source Commitment](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/open-source-is-in-our-dna-reaffirming-tidb-commitment?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Open source is at the core of TiDB&#039;s identity. All source code is available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license, including enterprise-grade features. TiDB is built with the belief that open source enables transparency, innovation, and collaboration. We actively encourage contributions from the community to help build a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem, reaffirming our commitment to open development and accessibility for everyone.

# Terraform Provider for Azure (Resource Manager)

The AzureRM Terraform Provider allows managing resources within Azure Resource Manager.

When using version 4.0 of the AzureRM Provider we recommend using the latest version of Terraform Core ([the latest version can be found here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)). 

* [Terraform Website](https://www.terraform.io)
* [AzureRM Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs)
* [AzureRM Provider Usage Examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples)

## Usage Example

```hcl
# 1. Specify the version of the AzureRM Provider to use
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source = &quot;hashicorp/azurerm&quot;
      version = &quot;=4.0.0&quot;
    }
  }
}

# 2. Configure the AzureRM Provider
provider &quot;azurerm&quot; {
  # The AzureRM Provider supports authenticating using via the Azure CLI, a Managed Identity
  # and a Service Principal. More information on the authentication methods supported by
  # the AzureRM Provider can be found here:
  # https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure

  # The features block allows changing the behaviour of the Azure Provider, more
  # information can be found here:
  # https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/features-block
  features {}
}

# 3. Create a resource group
resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;example&quot; {
  name     = &quot;example-resources&quot;
  location = &quot;West Europe&quot;
}

# 4. Create a virtual network within the resource group
resource &quot;azurerm_virtual_network&quot; &quot;example&quot; {
  name                = &quot;example-network&quot;
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  address_space       = [&quot;10.0.0.0/16&quot;]
}
```

The toolset to pack, ship, store, and deliver content.

This repository&#039;s main product is the Open Source Registry implementation
for storing and distributing container images and other content using the
[OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec).
The goal of this project is to provide a simple, secure, and scalable base
for building a large scale registry solution or running a simple private registry.
It is a core library for many registry operators including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry,
GitLab Container Registry and DigitalOcean Container Registry, as well as the CNCF Harbor
Project, and VMware Harbor Registry.

This repository contains the following components:

|**Component**       |Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **registry**       | An implementation of the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec).                                                                                                 |
| **libraries**      | A rich set of libraries for interacting with distribution components. Please see [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/distribution/distribution) for details. **Note**: The interfaces for these libraries are **unstable**. |
| **documentation**  | Full documentation is available at [https://distribution.github.io/distribution](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/).

### How does this integrate with Docker, containerd, and other OCI client?

Clients implement against the OCI specification and communicate with the
registry using HTTP. This project contains a client implementation which
is currently in use by Docker, however, it is deprecated for the
[implementation in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/master/remotes/docker)
and will not support new features.

### What are the long term goals of the Distribution project?

The _Distribution_ project has the further long term goal of providing a
secure tool chain for distributing content. The specifications, APIs and tools
should be as useful with Docker as they are without.

Our goal is to design a professional grade and extensible content distribution
system that allow users to:

* Enjoy an efficient, secured and reliable way to store, manage, package and
  exchange content
* Hack/roll their own on top of healthy open-source components
* Implement their own home made solution through good specs, and solid
  extensions mechanism.

## Contribution

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute

## Usage

1. Create a service account in Grafana with enough permissions to use the tools you want to use,
   generate a service account token, and copy it to the clipboard for use in the configuration file.
   Follow the [Grafana documentation][service-account] for details.

2. You have several options to install `mcp-grafana`:

   - **Docker image**: Use the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

     ```bash
     docker pull mcp/grafana
     docker run -p 8000:8000 -e GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000 -e GRAFANA_API_KEY=&lt;your service account token&gt; mcp/grafana
     ```

   - **Download binary**: Download the latest release of `mcp-grafana` from the [releases page](https://github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/releases) and place it in your `$PATH`.

   - **Build from source**: If you have a Go toolchain installed you can also build and install it from source, using the `GOBIN` environment variable
     to specify the directory where the binary should be installed. This should also be in your `PATH`.

     ```bash
     GOBIN=&quot;$HOME/go/bin&quot; go install github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/cmd/mcp-grafana@latest
     ```

3. Add the server configuration to your client configuration file. For example, for Claude Desktop:

   **If using the binary:**

   ```json
   {
     &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
       &quot;grafana&quot;: {
         &quot;command&quot;: &quot;mcp-grafana&quot;,
         &quot;args&quot;: [],
         &quot;env&quot;: {
           &quot;GRAFANA_URL&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;,
           &quot;GRAFANA_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;&lt;your service account token&gt;&quot;
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **If using Docker:**

   ```json
   {
     &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
       &quot;grafana&quot;: {
         &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
         &quot;args&quot;: [
           &quot;run&quot;,
           &quot;--rm&quot;,
           &quot;-p&quot;,
           &quot;8000:8000&quot;,
           &quot;-e&quot;,
           &quot;GRAFANA_URL&quot;,
           &quot;-e&quot;,
           &quot;GRAFANA_API_KEY&quot;,
           &quot;mcp/grafana&quot;
         ],
         &quot;env&quot;: {
           &quot;GRAFANA_URL&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;,
           &quot;GRAFANA_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;&lt;your service account token&gt;&quot;
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

&gt; Note: if you see `Error: spawn mcp-grafana ENOENT` in Claude Desktop, you need to specify the full path to `mcp-grafana`.

**Using VSCode with remote MCP server**

Make sure your `.vscode/settings.json` includes:

```json
&quot;mcp&quot;: {
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;grafana&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8000/sse&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

### Debug Mode

You can enable debug mode for the Grafana transport by adding the `-debug` flag to the command. This will provide detailed logging of HTTP requests and responses between the MCP server and the Grafana API, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

To use debug mode with the Claude Desktop configuration, update your config as follows:

**If using the binary:**

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;grafana&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;mcp-grafana&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-debug&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GRAFANA_URL&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;,
        &quot;GRAFANA_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;&lt;your service account token&gt;&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**If using Docker:**

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;grafana&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-p&quot;,
        &quot;8000:8000&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;GRAFANA_URL&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;GRAFANA_API_KEY&quot;,
        &quot;mcp/grafana&quot;,
        &quot;-debug&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GRAFANA_URL&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;,
        &quot;GRAFANA_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;&lt;your service account token&gt;&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.

This project is written in Go. Install Go following the instructions for your platform.

To run the server, use:

```bash
make run
```

You can also run the server using the SSE transport inside a custom built Docker image. To build the image, use

```
make build-image
```

And to run the image, use:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 mcp-grafana:latest
```

### Testing

There are three types of tests available:

1. Unit Tests (no external dependencies required):

```bash
make test-unit
```

You can also run unit tests with:

```bash
make test
```

2. Integration Tests (requires docker containers to be up and running):

```bash
make test-integration
```

3. Cloud Tests (requires cloud Grafana instance and credentials):

```bash
make test-cloud
```

&gt; Note: Cloud tests are automatically configured in CI. For local development, you&#039;ll need to set up your own Grafana Cloud instance and credentials.

More comprehensive integration tests will require a Grafana instance to be running locally on port 3000; you can start one with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The integration tests can be run with:

```bash
make test-all
```

If you&#039;re adding more tools, please add integration tests for them. The existing tests should be a good starting point.

### Linting

To lint the code, run:

```bash
make lint
```

This includes a custom linter that checks for unescaped commas in `jsonschema` struct tags. The commas in `description` fields must be escaped with `\\,` to prevent silent truncation. You can run just this linter with:

```bash
make lint-jsonschema
```

See the [JSONSchema Linter documentation](internal/linter/jsonschema/README.md) for more details.
