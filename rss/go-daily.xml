# Wave Terminal

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm?ref=badge_shield)

Wave is an open-source terminal that combines traditional terminal features with graphical capabilities like file previews, web browsing, and AI assistance. It runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

Modern development involves constantly switching between terminals and browsers - checking documentation, previewing files, monitoring systems, and using AI tools. Wave brings these graphical tools directly into the terminal, letting you control them from the command line. This means you can stay in your terminal workflow while still having access to the visual interfaces you need.

## Key Features

- Flexible drag &amp; drop interface to organize terminal blocks, editors, web browsers, and AI assistants
- Built-in editor for seamlessly editing remote files with syntax highlighting and modern editor features
- Rich file preview system for remote files (markdown, images, video, PDFs, CSVs, directories)
- Quick full-screen toggle for any block - expand terminals, editors, and previews for better visibility, then instantly return to multi-block view
- Wave AI - Context-aware terminal assistant that reads your terminal output, analyzes widgets, and performs file operations
- AI chat widget with support for multiple models (OpenAI, Claude, Azure, Perplexity, Ollama)
- Command Blocks for isolating and monitoring individual commands with auto-close options
- One-click remote connections with full terminal and file system access
- Secure secret storage using native system backends - store API keys and credentials locally, access them across SSH sessions
- Rich customization including tab themes, terminal styles, and background images
- Powerful `wsh` command system for managing your workspace from the CLI and sharing data between terminal sessions
- Connected file management with `wsh file` - seamlessly copy and sync files between local, remote SSH hosts, Wave filesystem, and S3

## Wave AI

Wave AI is your context-aware terminal assistant with access to your workspace:

- **Terminal Context**: Reads terminal output and scrollback for debugging and analysis
- **File Operations**: Read, write, and edit files with automatic backups and user approval
- **CLI Integration**: Use `wsh ai` to pipe output or attach files directly from the command line
- **Free Beta**: Included AI credits while we refine the experience
- **Coming Soon**: Command execution (with approval), local model support, and alternate AI providers (BYOK)

**micro** is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the capabilities
of modern terminals. It comes as a single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies; you can download and use it right now!

As its name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use.
It strives to be enjoyable as a full-time editor for people who prefer to work in a terminal, or those who regularly edit files over SSH.

Here is a picture of micro editing its source code.

To see more screenshots of micro, showcasing some of the default color schemes, see [here](https://micro-editor.github.io).

You can also check out the website for Micro at https://micro-editor.github.io.

## Installation

To install micro, you can download a [prebuilt binary](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/releases), or you can build it from source.

If you want more information about ways to install micro, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/wiki/Installing-Micro).

Use `micro -version` to get the version information after installing. It is only guaranteed that you are installing the most recent
stable version if you install from the prebuilt binaries, Homebrew, or Snap.

A desktop entry file and man page can be found in the [assets/packaging](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/assets/packaging) directory.

### Pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries are distributed in [releases](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/releases).

To uninstall micro, simply remove the binary, and the configuration directory at `~/.config/micro`.

#### Third-party quick-install script

```bash
curl https://getmic.ro | bash
```

The script will place the micro binary in the current directory. From there, you can move it to a directory on your path of your choosing (e.g. `sudo mv micro /usr/bin`). See its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/benweissmann/getmic.ro) for more information.

#### Eget

With [Eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) installed, you can easily get a pre-built binary:

```
eget zyedidia/micro
```

Use `--tag VERSION` to download a specific tagged version.

```
eget --tag nightly zyedidia/micro # download the nightly version (compiled every day at midnight UTC)
eget --tag v2.0.8 zyedidia/micro  # download version 2.0.8 rather than the latest release
```

You can install `micro` by adding `--to /usr/local/bin` to the `eget` command, or move the binary manually to a directory on your `$PATH` after the download completes.

See [Eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) for more information.

### Package managers

You can install micro using Homebrew on Mac:

```
brew install micro
```

**Note for Mac:** All micro keybindings use the control or alt (option) key, not the command
key. By default, macOS terminals do not forward alt key events. To fix this, please see
the section on [macOS terminals](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro#macos-terminal) further below.

On Linux, you can install micro through [snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install)

```
snap install micro --classic
```

Micro is also available through other package managers on Linux such as dnf, AUR, Nix, and package managers
for other operating systems. These packages are not guaranteed to be up-to-date.

&lt;!-- * `apt install micro` (Ubuntu 20.04 `focal`, and Debian `unstable | testing | buster-backports`). At the moment, this package (2.0.1-1) is outdated and has a known bug where debug mode is enabled. --&gt;

* Linux:
    * distro-specific package managers:
        * `dnf install micro` (Fedora).
        * `apt install micro` (Ubuntu and Debian).
        * `pacman -S micro` (Arch Linux).
        * `emerge app-editors/micro` (Gentoo).
        * `zypper install micro-editor` (SUSE)
        * `eopkg install micro` (Solus).
        * `pacstall -I micro` (Pacstall).
        * `apt-get install micro` (ALT Linux)
        * See [wiki](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/wiki/Installing-Micro) for details about CRUX, Termux.
    * distro-agnostic package managers:
        * `nix profile install nixpkgs#micro` (with [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and flakes enabled)
        * `flox install micro` (with [Flox](https://flox.dev))
* Windows: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org), [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) and [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/).
    * `choco install micro`.
    * `scoop install micro`.
    * `winget install zyedidia.micro`
* OpenBSD: Available in the ports tree and also available as a binary package.
    * `pkg_add -v micro`.
* NetBSD, macOS, Linux, Illumos, etc. with [pkgsrc](https://www.pkgsrc.org/)-current:
    * `pkg_add micro`
* macOS: Available in package managers.
    * `sudo port install micro` (with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org))
    * `brew install micro` (with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
    * `nix profile install nixpkgs#micro` (with [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and flakes enabled)
    * `flox install micro` (with [Flox](https://flox.dev))

**Note for Linux desktop environments:**

For interfacing with the local system clipboard, the following tools need to be installed:
* For X11, `xclip` or `xsel`
* For [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), `wl-clipboard`

Without these tools installed, micro will use an internal clipboard for copy and paste, but it won&#039;t be accessible to external applications.

### Building from source

If your operating system does not have a binary release, but does run Go, you can build from source.

Make sure that you have Go version 1.19 or greater and Go modules are enabled.

```
git clone https://github.com/zyedidia/micro
cd micro
make build
sudo mv micro /usr/local/bin # optional
```

The binary will be placed in the current directory and can be moved to
anywhere you like (for example `/usr/local/bin`).

The command `make install` will install the binary to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`.

You can install directly with `go get` (`go get github.com/zyedidia/micro/cmd/micro`) but this isn&#039;t
recommended because it doesn&#039;t build micro with version information (necessary for the plugin manager),
and doesn&#039;t disable debug mode.

### Fully static or dynamically linked binary

By default, the micro binary is linked statically to increase the portability of the prebuilt binaries.
This behavior can simply be overriden by providing `CGO_ENABLED=1` to the build target.

```
CGO_ENABLED=1 make build
```

Afterwards the micro binary will dynamically link with the present core system libraries.

**Note for Mac:**
Native macOS builds are done with `CGO_ENABLED=1` forced set to support adding the &quot;Information Property List&quot; in the linker step.

### macOS terminal

If you are using macOS, you should consider using [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) instead of the default terminal (Terminal.app). The iTerm2 terminal has much better mouse support as well as better handling of key events. For best keybinding behavior, choose `xterm defaults` under `Preferences-&gt;Profiles-&gt;Keys-&gt;Presets...`, and select `Esc+` for `Left Option Key` in the same menu. The newest versions also support true color.

If you still insist on using the default Mac terminal, be sure to set `Use Option key as Meta key` under
`Preferences-&gt;Profiles-&gt;Keyboard` to use &lt;kbd&gt;option&lt;/kbd&gt; as &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;.

### WSL and Windows Console

If you use micro within WSL, it is highly recommended that you use the [Windows
Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&amp;gl=us)
instead of the default Windows Console.

If you must use Windows Console for some reason, note that there is a bug in
Windows Console WSL that causes a font change whenever micro tries to access
the external clipboard via powershell. To fix this, use an internal clipboard
with `set clipboard internal` (though your system clipboard will no longer be
available in micro).

### Colors and syntax highlighting

If you open micro and it doesn&#039;t seem like syntax highlighting is working, this is probably because
you are using a terminal which does not support 256 color mode. Try changing the color scheme to `simple`
by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl-e&lt;/kbd&gt; in micro and typing `set colorscheme simple`.

If you are using the default Ubuntu terminal, to enable 256 color mode make sure your `TERM` variable is set
to `xterm-256color`.

Many of the Windows terminals don&#039;t support more than 16 colors, which means
that micro&#039;s default color scheme won&#039;t look very good. You can either set
the color scheme to `simple`, or download and configure a better terminal emulator
than the Windows default.

### Cygwin, Mingw, Plan9

Cygwin, Mingw, and Plan9 are unfortunately not officially supported. In Cygwin and Mingw, micro will often work when run using
the `winpty` utility:

```
winpty micro.exe ...
```

Micro uses the amazing [tcell library](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell), but this
means that micro is restricted to the platforms tcell supports. As a result, micro does not support
Plan9 or Cygwin (although this may change in the future). Micro also doesn&#039;t support NaCl (which is deprecated anyway).

## Usage

Once you have built the editor, start it by running `micro path/to/file.txt` or `micro` to open an empty buffer.

micro also supports creating buffers from `stdin`:

```sh
ip a | micro
```

You can move the cursor around with the arrow keys and mouse.

You can also use the mouse to manipulate the text. Simply clicking and dragging
will select text. You can also double click to enable word selection, and triple
click to enable line selection.

## Documentation and Help

micro has a built-in help system which you can access by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl-e&lt;/kbd&gt; and typing `help`. Additionally, you can

## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don&#039;t need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Method 1: Using Make commands (Recommended)
make dev-start      # Start infrastructure
make dev-app        # Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend (new terminal)

# Method 2: One-click start
./scripts/quick-dev.sh

# Method 3: Using scripts
./scripts/dev.sh start     # Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev.sh app       # Start backend (new terminal)
./scripts/dev.sh frontend  # Start frontend (new terminal)
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/399433.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/399433)

## Installation

If you are migrating from another AUR helper, you can simply install Yay with that helper.

&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; We are using `sudo` in these examples, you can switch that out for a different privilege escalation tool.

### Source

The initial installation of Yay can be done by cloning the PKGBUILD and
building with makepkg:

We make sure we have the `base-devel` package group installed.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel &amp;&amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git &amp;&amp; cd yay &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
```

### Binary

If you do not want to compile yay yourself you can use the builds generated by
GitHub Actions.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel &amp;&amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git &amp;&amp; cd yay-bin &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
```

### Other distributions

If you&#039;re using Manjaro or [another distribution that packages `yay`](https://repology.org/project/yay/versions)
you can simply install yay using pacman (as root):

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel yay
```
&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; distributions sometimes lag updating yay on their repositories.

## First Use

#### Development packages upgrade

- Use `yay -Y --gendb` to generate a development package database for `*-git`
  packages that were installed without yay.
  This command should only be run once.

- `yay -Syu --devel` will then check for development package updates

- Use `yay -Y --devel --save` to make development package updates permanently
  enabled (`yay` and `yay -Syu` will then always check dev packages)

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Yay does not display colored output. How do I fix it?**

  Make sure you have the `Color` option in your `/etc/pacman.conf`
  (see issue [#123](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/123)).

- **Sometimes diffs are printed to the terminal, and other times they are paged via less. How do I fix this?**

  Yay uses `git diff` to display diffs, which by default tells less not to
  page if the output can fit into one terminal length. This behavior can be
  overridden by exporting your own flags (`export LESS=SRX`).

- **Yay is not asking me to edit PKGBUILDS, and I don&#039;t like the diff menu! What can I do?**

  `yay --editmenu --diffmenu=false --save`

- **How can I tell Yay to act only on AUR packages, or only on repo packages?**

  `yay -{OPERATION} --aur`
  `yay -{OPERATION} --repo`

- **A `Flagged Out Of Date AUR Packages` message is displayed. Why doesn&#039;t Yay update them?**

  This message does not mean that updated AUR packages are available. It means
  the packages have been flagged out of date on the AUR, but
  their maintainers have not yet updated the `PKGBUILD`s
  (see [outdated AUR packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Foo_in_the_AUR_is_outdated.3B_what_should_I_do.3F)).

- **Yay doesn&#039;t install dependencies added to a PKGBUILD during installation.**

  Yay resolves all dependencies ahead of time. You are free to edit the
  PKGBUILD in any way, but any problems you cause are your own and should not be
  reported unless they can be reproduced with the original PKGBUILD.

- **I know my `-git` package has updates but yay doesn&#039;t offer to update it**

  Yay uses a hash cache for development packages. Normally it is updated at the end of the package install with the message `Found git repo`.
  If you transition between aur helpers and did not install the devel package using yay at some point, it is possible it never got added to the cache. `yay -Y --gendb` will fix the current version of every devel package and start checking from there.

- **I want to help out!**

  Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Support

All support related to Yay should be requested via GitHub issues. Since Yay is not
officially supported by Arch Linux, support should not be sought out on the
forums, AUR comments or other official channels.

A broken AUR package should be reported as a comment on the package&#039;s AUR page.
A package may only be considered broken if it fails to build with makepkg.

Reports should be made using makepkg and include the full output as well as any
other relevant information. Never make reports using Yay or any other external
tools.

# Evilginx 3.0

**Evilginx** is a man-in-the-middle attack framework used for phishing login credentials along with session cookies, which in turn allows to bypass 2-factor authentication protection.

This tool is a successor to [Evilginx](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx), released in 2017, which used a custom version of nginx HTTP server to provide man-in-the-middle functionality to act as a proxy between a browser and phished website.
Present version is fully written in GO as a standalone application, which implements its own HTTP and DNS server, making it extremely easy to set up and use.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgretzky/evilginx2/master/media/img/screen.png&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Disclaimer

I am very much aware that Evilginx can be used for nefarious purposes. This work is merely a demonstration of what adept attackers can do. It is the defender&#039;s responsibility to take such attacks into consideration and find ways to protect their users against this type of phishing attacks. Evilginx should be used only in legitimate penetration testing assignments with written permission from to-be-phished parties.

## Evilginx Pro is now available!

This is it! After over two years of development, countless delays, and hundreds of manual company verifications, concluded with multiple hurdles related to export regulations, [Evilginx Pro is finally live!](https://evilginx.com)

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://evilginx.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Evilginx Mastery&quot; src=&quot;https://breakdev.org/content/images/size/w2000/2025/03/evilginx_pro_release_cover.png&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Evilginx Pro is the fruit of a passion I&#039;ve had for a long time in developing offensive security tools for cybersecurity enthusiasts. The journey has just begun, and now that the product is officially released, I can focus on making it even better by implementing all the ideas I&#039;ve planned for it.

### Key features:

- Tested and maintained **official phishlets database**
- **Botguard** to **prevent bot traffic** by default (same concept as Cloudflare Turnstile)
- **Evilpuppet** for advanced phishing capability (Google)
- External **DNS providers** with multi-domain support
- **Website spoofing** for unauthorized requests
- **JavaScript** &amp; **HTML obfuscation**
- **Wildcard TLS certificates**
- **Automated** server deployment

## Getting Started

The server is simple to setup and run for local development and can be deployed to any cloud provider. See the [deployment notes](#deployment) for recommendations on how to deploy the project for production. Nakama server requires CockroachDB or another Postgres wire-compatible server as it&#039;s database.

### Docker

&lt;a href=&quot;https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Docker_logo.svg&quot; width=&quot;170&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The fastest way to run the server and the database is with Docker. Setup Docker and start the daemon.

1. Set up a [docker-compose file](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/install/docker/#running-nakama) and place it in a folder for your project.

2. Run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up` to download container images and run the servers.

For more detailed instructions have a look at our [Docker quickstart](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/install/docker) guide.

Nakama Docker images are maintained on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama/tags) and [prerelease](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama-prerelease/tags) images are occasionally published for cutting edge features of the server.

### Binaries

You can run the servers with native binaries for your platform.

1. Download the server from our [releases](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases) page and the [database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb.html).

2. Follow the database [instructions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html#before-you-begin) to start it.

3. Run a migration which will setup or upgrade the database schema:

   ```shell
   nakama migrate up --database.address &quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;
   ```

4. Start Nakama and connect to the database:

   ```shell
   nakama --database.address &quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;
   ```

When connected you&#039;ll see server output which describes all settings the server uses for [configuration](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/configuration).

&gt; {&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;ts&quot;:&quot;2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;Node&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;nakama&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2.0.0+7e18b09&quot;,&quot;runtime&quot;:&quot;go1.10.1&quot;,&quot;cpu&quot;:4} &lt;br/&gt;
&gt; {&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;ts&quot;:&quot;2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;Database connections&quot;,&quot;dsns&quot;:[&quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;]} &lt;br/&gt;
&gt; ...

## Usage

Nakama supports a variety of protocols optimized for various gameplay or app use cases. For request/response it can use GRPC or the HTTP1.1+JSON fallback (REST). For realtime communication you can use WebSockets or rUDP.

For example with the REST API to authenticate a user account with a device identifier.

```shell
curl &quot;127.0.0.1:7350/v2/account/authenticate/device?create=true&quot; \
  --user &quot;defaultkey:&quot; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;someuniqueidentifier&quot;}&#039;
```

Response:

&gt; { &lt;br&gt;
&gt;     &quot;token&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjQ5OTU2NDksInVpZCI6Ijk5Y2Q1YzUyLWE5ODgtNGI2NC04YThhLTVmMTM5YTg4MTgxMiIsInVzbiI6InhBb1RxTUVSdFgifQ.-3_rXNYx3Q4jKuS7RkxeMWBzMNAm0vl93QxzRI8p_IY&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; }

There&#039;s a number of official [client libraries](https://github.com/heroiclabs) available on GitHub with [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs). The current platform/language support includes: .NET (in C#), Unity engine, JavaScript, Java (with Android), Unreal engine, Godot, Defold, and Swift (with iOS). If you&#039;d like to contribute a client or request one let us know.

## Nakama Console

The server provides a web UI which teams can use to inspect various data stored through the server APIs, view lightweight service metrics, manage player data, update storage objects, restrict access to production with permission profiles, and gain visibility into realtime features like active multiplayer matches. There is no separate installation required as it is embedded as part of the single server binary.

You can navigate to it on your browser on [http://127.0.0.1:7351](http://127.0.0.1:7351).

## Deployment

Nakama can be deployed to any cloud provider such as Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, or your own private cloud. You should setup and provision separate nodes for Nakama and CockroachDB.

The recommended minimum production infrastructure for CockroachDB is outlined in [these docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/recommended-production-settings.html#basic-hardware-recommendations) and Nakama can be run on instance types as small as &quot;g1-small&quot; on Google Cloud although we recommend a minimum of &quot;n1-standard-1&quot; in production. The specific hardware requirements will depend on what features of the server are used. Reach out to us for help and advice on what servers to run.

### Heroic Cloud

You can support development, new features, and maintainance of the server by using the Heroic Labs&#039; [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) for deployment. This service handles the uptime, replication, backups, logs, data upgrades, and all other tasks involved with production server environments.

Have a look at our [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) service for more details.

## Contribute

The development roadmap is managed as GitHub issues and pull requests are welcome. If you&#039;re interested to add a feature which is not mentioned on the issue tracker please open one to create a discussion or drop in and discuss it in the [community forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com).

### Simple Builds

All dependencies required for a build are vendored as part of the Go project. We recommend a modern release of the Go toolchain and do not store the codebase in the old GOPATH.

1. Download the source tree.

   ```shell
   git clone &quot;https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama&quot; nakama
   cd nakama
   ```

2. Build the project from source.

   ```shell
   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor
   ./nakama --version
   ```

### Full Source Builds

The codebase uses Protocol Buffers, GRPC, GRPC-Gateway, and the OpenAPI spec as part of the project. These dependencies are generated as sources and committed to the repository to simplify builds for contributors.

To build the codebase and generate all sources follow these steps.

1. Install the toolchain.

   ```shell
   go install \
       &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot; \
       &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot; \
       &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot; \
       &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
   ```

2. Re-generate the protocol buffers and gateway code.

   ```shell
   buf generate apigrpc -o apigrpc
   buf generate console -o console
   ```

3. Build the codebase.

   ```shell
   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor
   ```

### Testing

In order to run all the unit and integration tests run:

```shell
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-tests.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit; docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-tests.yml down -v
```

This will create an isolated environment with Nakama and database instances, run
all the tests, and drop the environment afterwards.

# 🚀 Start the Backend Locally

We have an `acontext-cli` to help you do quick proof-of-concept. Download it first in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.acontext.io | sh
```

You should have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and an OpenAI API Key to start an Acontext backend on your computer:

```bash
mkdir acontext_server &amp;&amp; cd acontext_server
acontext docker up
```

&gt; [📖 local setup](https://docs.acontext.io/local#start-acontext-server-locally) Acontext requires at least an OpenAI API key. We recommend `gpt-5.1` or `gpt-4.1` as the LLM model

`acontext docker up` will create/use  `.env` and `config.yaml` for Acontext, and create a `db` folder to persist data.



Once it&#039;s done, you can access the following endpoints:

- Acontext API Base URL: http://localhost:8029/api/v1
- Acontext Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/



&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Dashboard&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/BI.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dashboard of Agent Success Rate and Other Metrics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






# 🧐 Use Acontext to build Agent

Download end-to-end scripts with `acontext`:

**Python**

```bash
acontext create my-proj --template-path &quot;python/openai-basic&quot;
```

&gt; More examples on Python:
&gt;
&gt; - `python/openai-agent-basic`: self-learning agent in openai agent sdk.
&gt; - `python/agno-basic`: self-learning agent in agno frameworkd.
&gt; - `python/openai-agent-artifacts`: agent that can edit and download artifacts.

**Typescript**

```bash
acontext create my-proj --template-path &quot;typescript/openai-basic&quot;
```

&gt; More examples on Typescript:
&gt;
&gt; - `typescript/vercel-ai-basic`: self-learning agent in @vercel/ai-sdk



Check our example repo for more templates: [Acontext-Examples](https://github.com/memodb-io/Acontext-Examples).



## SDK Walk-through

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to Open&lt;/summary&gt;


We&#039;re maintaining Python [![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/acontext.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/acontext/) and Typescript [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@acontext/acontext.svg?logo=npm&amp;logoColor=fff&amp;style=flat&amp;labelColor=2C2C2C&amp;color=28CF8D)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@acontext/acontext) SDKs. The snippets below are using Python.

## Install SDKs

```
pip install acontext # for Python
npm i @acontext/acontext # for Typescript
```



## Initialize Client

```python
from acontext import AcontextClient

client = AcontextClient(
    base_url=&quot;http://localhost:8029/api/v1&quot;,
    api_key=&quot;sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token&quot;
)
client.ping()

# yes, the default api_key is sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token
```

&gt; [📖 async client doc](https://docs.acontext.io/settings/core)



## Store

Acontext can manage agent sessions and artifacts.

### Save Messages [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/api-reference/session/send-message-to-session)

Acontext offers persistent storage for message data. When you call `session.send_message`, Acontext will persist the message and start to monitor this session:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Code Snippet&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
session = client.sessions.create()

messages = [
    {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I need to write a landing page of iPhone 15 pro max&quot;},
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sure, my plan is below:\n1. Search for the latest news about iPhone 15 pro max\n2. Init Next.js project for the landing page\n3. Deploy the landing page to the website&quot;,
    }
]

# Save messages
for msg in messages:
    client.sessions.send_message(session_id=session.id, blob=msg, format=&quot;openai&quot;)
```

&gt; [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/store/messages/multi-modal) We also support multi-modal message storage and anthropic SDK.


&lt;/details&gt;

### Load Messages [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/api-reference/session/get-messages-from-session)

Obtain your session messages using `sessions.get_messages`

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Code Snippet&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
r = client.sessions.get_messages(session.id)
new_msg = r.items

new_msg.append({&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How are you doing?&quot;})
r = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model=&quot;gpt-4.1&quot;, messages=new_msg)
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
client.sessions.send_message(session_id=session.id, blob=r.choices[0].message)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Session&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/message_viewer.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can view sessions in your local Dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


### Artifacts [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/store/disk)

Create a disk for your agent to store and read artifacts using file paths:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Code Snippet&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
from acontext import FileUpload

disk = client.disks.create()

file = FileUpload(
    filename=&quot;todo.md&quot;,
    content=b&quot;# Sprint Plan\n\n## Goals\n- Complete user authentication\n- Fix critical bugs&quot;
)
artifact = client.disks.artifacts.upsert(
    disk.id,
    file=file,
    file_path=&quot;/todo/&quot;
)


print(client.disks.artifacts.list(
    disk.id,
    path=&quot;/todo/&quot;
))

result = client.disks.artifacts.get(
    disk.id,
    file_path=&quot;/todo/&quot;,
    filename=&quot;todo.md&quot;,
    with_public_url=True,
    with_content=True
)
print(f&quot;✓ File content: {result.content.raw}&quot;)
print(f&quot;✓ Download URL: {result.public_url}&quot;)        
```
&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Artifacts&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/artifact_viewer.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can view artifacts in your local Dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



## Observe [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/observe)

For every session, Acontext will **automatically** launch a background agent to track the task progress and user feedback. **It&#039;s like a background TODO agent**. Acontext will use it to observe your daily agent success rate.

You can use the SDK to retrieve the current state of the agent session, for Context Engineering like Reduction and Compression. 

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Full Script&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
from acontext import AcontextClient

# Initialize client
client = AcontextClient(
    base_url=&quot;http://localhost:8029/api/v1&quot;, api_key=&quot;sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token&quot;
)

# Create a project and session
session = client.sessions.create()

# Conversation messages
messages = [
    {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I need to write a landing page of iPhone 15 pro max&quot;},
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sure, my plan is below:\n1. Search for the latest news about iPhone 15 pro max\n2. Init Next.js project for the landing page\n3. Deploy the landing page to the website&quot;,
    },
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;That sounds good. Let&#039;s first collect the message and report to me before any landing page coding.&quot;,
    },
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sure, I will first collect the message then report to you before any landing page coding.&quot;,
      	&quot;tool_calls&quot;: [
            {
                &quot;id&quot;: &quot;call_001&quot;,
                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;function&quot;,
                &quot;function&quot;: {
                    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;search_news&quot;,
                    &quot;arguments&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;query\&quot;: \&quot;iPhone news\&quot;}&quot;
                }
            }
        ]
    },
]

# Send messages in a loop
for msg in messages:
    client.sessions.send_message(session_id=session.id, blob=msg, format=&quot;openai&quot;)

# Wait for task extraction to complete
client.sessions.flush(session.id)

# Display extracted tasks
tasks_response = client.sessions.get_tasks(session.id)
print(tasks_response)
for task in tasks_response.items:
    print(f&quot;\nTask #{task.order}:&quot;)
    print(f&quot;  ID: {task.id}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;  Title: {task.data[&#039;task_description&#039;]}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;  Status: {task.status}&quot;)

    # Show progress updates if available
    if &quot;progresses&quot; in task.data:
        print(f&quot;  Progress updates: {len(task.data[&#039;progresses&#039;])}&quot;)
        for progress in task.data[&quot;progresses&quot;]:
            print(f&quot;    - {progress}&quot;)

    # Show user preferences if available
    if &quot;user_preferences&quot; in task.data:
        print(&quot;  User preferences:&quot;)
        for pref in task.data[&quot;user_preferences&quot;]:
            print(f&quot;    - {pref}&quot;)

```
&gt; `flush` is a blocking call, it will wait for the task extraction to complete.
&gt; You don&#039;t need to call it in production, Acontext has a [buffer mechanism](https://docs.acontext.io/observe/buffer) to ensure the task extraction is completed right on time.

&lt;/details&gt;

Example Task Return:

```txt
Task #1:
  Title: Search for the latest news about iPhone 15 Pro Max and report findings to the user before any landing page coding.
  Status: success
  Progress updates: 2
    - I confirmed that the first step will be reporting before moving on to landing page development.
    - I have already collected all the iPhone 15 pro max info and reported to the user, waiting for approval for next step.
  User preferences:
    - user expects a report on latest news about iPhone 15 pro max before any coding work on the landing page.

Task #2:
  Title: Initialize a Next.js project for the iPhone 15 Pro Max landing page.
  Status: pending

Task #3:
  Title: Deploy the completed landing page to the website.
  Status: pending
```



You can view the session tasks&#039; statuses in the Dashboard:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Acontext Learning&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/session_task_viewer.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Task Demo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



## Self-learning

Acontext can gather a bunch of sessions and learn skills (SOPs) on how to call tools for certain tasks.

### Learn Skills to a `Space` [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/learn/skill-space)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;A Space Demo&quot; src=&quot;./assets/acontext_dataflow.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How self-learning works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A `Space` can store skills, and memories in a Notion-like system. You first need to connect a session to `Space` to enable the learning process:

```python
# Step 1: Create a Space for skill learning
space = client.spaces.create()
print(f&quot;Created Space: {space.id}&quot;)

# Step 2: Create a session attached to the space
session = client.sessions.create(space_id=space.id)

# ... push the agent working context
```

The learning happens in the background and is not real-time (delay around 10-30s). 

What Acontext will do in the background:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Task Completed] --&gt; B[Task Extraction]
    B --&gt; C{Space Connected?}
    C --&gt;|Yes| D[Queue for Learning]
    C --&gt;|No| E[Skip Learning]
    D --&gt; F[Extract SOP]
    F --&gt; G{Hard Enough?}
    G --&gt;|No - Too Simple| H[Skip Learning]
    G --&gt;|Yes - Complex| I[Store as Skill Block]
    I --&gt; J[Available for Future Sessions]
```

Eventually, SOP blocks with tool-call pattern will be saved to `Space`. You can view every `Space` in the Dashboard:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;A Space Demo&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/skill_viewer.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Space Demo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




### Search Skills from a `Space` [📖](https://docs.acontext.io/learn/search-skills)

To search skills from a `Space` and use them in the next session:

```python
result = client.spaces.experience_search(
    space_id=space.id,
    query=&quot;I need to implement authentication&quot;,
  	mode=&quot;fast&quot;
)
```

Acontext supports `fast` and `agentic` modes for search. The former uses embeddings to match skills. The latter uses an Experience Agent to explore the entire `Space` and tries to cover every skill needed.

The return is a list of sop blocks, which look like below:

```json
{
    &quot;use_when&quot;: &quot;star a github repo&quot;,
    &quot;preferences&quot;: &quot;use personal account. star but not fork&quot;,
    &quot;tool_sops&quot;: [
        {&quot;tool_name&quot;: &quot;goto&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;goto the user given github repo url&quot;},
        {&quot;tool_name&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;find login button if any, and start to login first&quot;},
        ...
    ]
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Credits

- [Xray-core v1.0.0](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was forked from [v2fly-core 9a03cc5](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/commit/9a03cc5c98d04cc28320fcee26dbc236b3291256), and we have made &amp; accumulated a huge number of enhancements over time, check [the release notes for each version](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases).
- For third-party projects used in [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core), check your local or [the latest go.mod](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/blob/main/go.mod).

## One-line Compilation

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED=0
go build -o xray.exe -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Reproducible Releases

Make sure that you are using the same Go version, and remember to set the git commit id (7 bytes):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;all=-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

If you are compiling a 32-bit MIPS/MIPSLE target, use this command instead:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

## What is frp?

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone&#039;s needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh1&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-a.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh2&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-b.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-a.example.com`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-b.example.com`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhostHTTPSPort`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;web&quot;
  type = &quot;http&quot;
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = [&quot;www.example.com&quot;]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;dns&quot;
  type = &quot;udp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  unixPath = &quot;/var/run/docker.sock&quot;
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_static_file&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;static_file&quot;
  localPath = &quot;/tmp/files&quot;
  stripPrefix = &quot;static&quot;
  httpUser = &quot;abc&quot;
  httpPassword = &quot;abc&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `localAddr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_https2http&quot;
  type = &quot;https&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;test.example.com&quot;]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;https2http&quot;
  localAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:80&quot;
  crtPath = &quot;./server.crt&quot;
  keyPath = &quot;./server.key&quot;
  hostHeaderRewrite = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = &quot;frp&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `secretKey` field for the preshared key, and that the `remotePort` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`secretKey` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn&#039;t work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

These configuration files is for reference only. Please do not use this configuration directly to run the program as it may have various issues.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps_full_example.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc_full_example.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go&#039;s standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}&quot;
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = {{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remember to prefix your reference with `.Envs`.

# KAI Scheduler
KAI Scheduler is a robust, efficient, and scalable [Kubernetes scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/) that optimizes GPU resource allocation for AI and machine learning workloads.

Designed to manage large-scale GPU clusters, including thousands of nodes, and high-throughput of workloads, makes the KAI Scheduler ideal for extensive and demanding environments.
KAI Scheduler allows administrators of Kubernetes clusters to dynamically allocate GPU resources to workloads. 

KAI Scheduler supports the entire AI lifecycle, from small, interactive jobs that require minimal resources to large training and inference, all within the same cluster. 
It ensures optimal resource allocation while maintaining resource fairness between the different consumers.
It can run alongside other schedulers installed on the cluster.

## Key Features
* [Batch Scheduling](docs/batch/README.md): Ensure all pods in a group are scheduled simultaneously or not at all.
* Bin Packing &amp; Spread Scheduling: Optimize node usage either by minimizing fragmentation (bin-packing) or increasing resiliency and load balancing (spread scheduling).
* [Workload Priority](docs/priority/README.md): Prioritize workloads effectively within queues.
* [Hierarchical Queues](docs/queues/README.md): Manage workloads with two-level queue hierarchies for flexible organizational control.
* [Resource distribution](docs/fairness/README.md#resource-division-algorithm): Customize quotas, over-quota weights, limits, and priorities per queue.
* [Fairness Policies](docs/fairness/README.md#reclaim-strategies): Ensure equitable resource distribution using Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) and resource reclamation across queues.
* Workload Consolidation: Reallocate running workloads intelligently to reduce fragmentation and increase cluster utilization.
* [Elastic Workloads](docs/elastic/README.md): Dynamically scale workloads within defined minimum and maximum pod counts.
* Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA): Support vendor-specific hardware resources through Kubernetes ResourceClaims (e.g., GPUs from NVIDIA or AMD).
* [GPU Sharing](docs/gpu-sharing/README.md): Allow multiple workloads to efficiently share single or multiple GPUs, maximizing resource utilization.
* Cloud &amp; On-premise Support: Fully compatible with dynamic cloud infrastructures (including auto-scalers like Karpenter) as well as static on-premise deployments.

## Benchmarks 

Some good benchmarks VictoriaMetrics achieved:

* **Minimal memory footprint**: handling millions of unique timeseries with [10x less RAM](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) than InfluxDB, up to [7x less RAM](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Highly scalable and performance** for [data ingestion](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and [querying](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4), [20x outperforms](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.
* **High data compression**: [70x more data points](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4) may be stored into limited storage than TimescaleDB, [7x less storage](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) space is required than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Reducing storage costs**: [10x more effective](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/casestudies/#grammarly) than Graphite according to the Grammarly case study.
* **A single-node VictoriaMetrics** can replace medium-sized clusters built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. See [VictoriaMetrics vs Thanos](https://medium.com/@valyala/comparing-thanos-to-victoriametrics-cluster-b193bea1683), [Measuring vertical scalability](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae), [Remote write storage wars - PromCon 2019](https://promcon.io/2019-munich/talks/remote-write-storage-wars/).
* **Optimized for storage**: [Works well with high-latency IO](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and low IOPS (HDD and network storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Domain list community

This project manages a list of domains, to be used as geosites for routing purpose in Project V.

## Purpose of this project

This project is not opinionated. In other words, it does NOT endorse, claim or imply that a domain should be blocked or proxied. It can be used to generate routing rules on demand.

## Download links

- **dlc.dat**：[https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat)
- **dlc.dat.sha256sum**：[https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat.sha256sum](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat.sha256sum)

## Usage example

Each file in the `data` directory can be used as a rule in this format: `geosite:filename`.

```json
&quot;routing&quot;: {
  &quot;domainStrategy&quot;: &quot;IPIfNonMatch&quot;,
  &quot;rules&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Reject&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [

      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-2&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-dev&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-3&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:geolocation-!cn&quot;
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Generate `dlc.dat` manually

- Install `golang` and `git`
- Clone project code: `git clone https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community.git`
- Navigate to project root directory: `cd domain-list-community`
- Install project dependencies: `go mod download`
- Generate `dlc.dat` (without `datapath` option means to use domain lists in `data` directory of current working directory):
  - `go run ./`
  - `go run ./ --datapath=/path/to/your/custom/data/directory`

Run `go run ./ --help` for more usage information.

## Structure of data

All data are under `data` directory. Each file in the directory represents a sub-list of domains, named by the file name. File content is in the following format.

```
# comments
include:another-file
domain:google.com @attr1 @attr2
keyword:google
regexp:www\.google\.com$
full:www.google.com
```

**Syntax:**

&gt; The following types of rules are **NOT** fully compatible with the ones that defined by user in V2Ray config file. Do **Not** copy and paste directly.

* Comment begins with `#`. It may begin anywhere in the file. The content in the line after `#` is treated as comment and ignored in production.
* Inclusion begins with `include:`, followed by the file name of an existing file in the same directory.
* Subdomain begins with `domain:`, followed by a valid domain name. The prefix `domain:` may be omitted.
* Keyword begins with `keyword:`, followed by a string.
* Regular expression begins with `regexp:`, followed by a valid regular expression (per Golang&#039;s standard).
* Full domain begins with `full:`, followed by a complete and valid domain name.
* Domains (including `domain`, `keyword`, `regexp` and `full`) may have one or more attributes. Each attribute begins with `@` and followed by the name of the attribute.

&gt; **Note:** Adding new `regexp` and `keyword` rules is discouraged because it is easy to use them incorrectly, and proxy software cannot efficiently match these types of rules.

## How it works

The entire `data` directory will be built into an external `geosite` file for Project V. Each file in the directory represents a section in the generated file.

To generate a section:

1. Remove all the comments in the file.
2. Replace `include:` lines with the actual content of the file.
3. Omit all empty lines.
4. Generate each `domain:` line into a [sub-domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L21).
5. Generate each `keyword:` line into a [plain domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L17).
6. Generate each `regexp:` line into a [regex domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L19).
7. Generate each `full:` line into a [full domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L23).

## How to organize domains

### File name

Theoretically any string can be used as the name, as long as it is a valid file name. In practice, we prefer names for determinic group of domains, such as the owner (usually a company name) of the domains, e.g., &quot;google&quot;, &quot;netflix&quot;. Names with unclear scope are generally unrecommended, such as &quot;evil&quot;, or &quot;local&quot;.

### Attributes

Attribute is useful for sub-group of domains, especially for filtering purpose. For example, the list of `google` domains may contains its main domains, as well as domains that serve ads. The ads domains may be marked by attribute `@ads`, and can be used as `geosite:google@ads` in V2Ray routing.

----

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who&#039;s involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

----

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

## To start developing K8s

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```

For the full story, head over to the [developer&#039;s documentation].

## Support

If you need support, start with the [troubleshooting guide],
and work your way through the process that we&#039;ve outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us
[one way or another][communication].

# About

[Fyne](https://fyne.io) is an easy-to-use UI toolkit and app API written in Go.
It is designed to build applications that run on desktop and mobile devices with a
single codebase.

# Prerequisites

To develop apps using Fyne you will need Go version 1.17 or later, a C compiler and your system&#039;s development tools.
If you&#039;re not sure if that&#039;s all installed or you don&#039;t know how then check out our
[Getting Started](https://fyne.io/develop/) document.

Using the standard go tools you can install Fyne&#039;s core library using:

    go get fyne.io/fyne/v2@latest

After importing a new module, run the following command before compiling the code for the first time. Avoid running it before writing code that uses the module to prevent accidental removal of dependencies:

    go mod tidy

# Widget demo

To run a showcase of the features of Fyne execute the following:

    go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo@latest
    fyne_demo

And you should see something like this (after you click a few buttons):

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-dark.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Dark Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Or if you are using the light theme:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-light.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Light Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

And even running on a mobile device:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-mobile-light.png&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Mobile Light Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

# Getting Started

Fyne is designed to be really easy to code with.
If you have followed the prerequisite steps above then all you need is a
Go IDE (or a text editor).

Open a new file and you&#039;re ready to write your first app!

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/app&quot;
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/container&quot;
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget&quot;
)

func main() {
	a := app.New()
	w := a.NewWindow(&quot;Hello&quot;)

	hello := widget.NewLabel(&quot;Hello Fyne!&quot;)
	w.SetContent(container.NewVBox(
		hello,
		widget.NewButton(&quot;Hi!&quot;, func() {
			hello.SetText(&quot;Welcome :)&quot;)
		}),
	))

	w.ShowAndRun()
}
```

And you can run that simply as:

    go run main.go

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; The first compilation of Fyne on Windows _can_ take up to 10 minutes, depending on your hardware. Subsequent builds will be fast.

It should look like this:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;img/hello-light.png&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Hello Dark Theme&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;img/hello-dark.png&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Hello Dark Theme&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Run in mobile simulation

There is a helpful mobile simulation mode that gives a hint of how your app would work on a mobile device:

    go run -tags mobile main.go

Another option is to use `fyne` command, see [Packaging for mobile](#packaging-for-mobile).

# Installing

Using `go install` will copy the executable into your go `bin` dir.
To install the application with icons etc into your operating system&#039;s standard
application location you can use the fyne utility and the &quot;install&quot; subcommand.

    go install fyne.io/tools/cmd/fyne@latest
    fyne install

# Packaging for mobile

To run on a mobile device it is necessary to package up the application.
To do this we can use the fyne utility &quot;package&quot; subcommand.
You will need to add appropriate parameters as prompted, but the basic command is shown below.
Once packaged you can install using the platform development tools or the fyne &quot;install&quot; subcommand.

    fyne package -os android -appID my.domain.appname
    fyne install -os android

The built Android application can run either in a real device or an Android emulator.
However, building for iOS is slightly different.
If the &quot;-os&quot; argument is &quot;ios&quot;, it is build only for a real iOS device.
Specify &quot;-os&quot; to &quot;iossimulator&quot; allows the application be able to run in an iOS simulator:

    fyne package -os ios -appID my.domain.appname
    fyne package -os iossimulator -appID my.domain.appname

# Preparing a release

Using the fyne utility &quot;release&quot; subcommand you can package up your app for release
to app stores and market places. Make sure you have the standard build tools installed
and have followed the platform documentation for setting up accounts and signing.
Then you can execute something like the following, notice the `-os ios` parameter allows
building an iOS app from macOS computer. Other combinations work as well :)

    $ fyne release -os ios -certificate &quot;Apple Distribution&quot; -profile &quot;My App Distribution&quot; -appID &quot;com.example.myapp&quot;

The above command will create a &#039;.ipa&#039; file that can then be uploaded to the iOS App Store.

# Documentation

More documentation is available at the [Fyne developer website](https://developer.fyne.io/) or on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/fyne/v2?tab=doc).

# Examples

You can find many example applications in the [examples repository](https://github.com/fyne-io/examples/).
Alternatively a list of applications using fyne can be found at [our website](https://apps.fyne.io/).

# Shipping the Fyne Toolkit

All Fyne apps will work without pre-installed libraries, this is one reason the apps are so portable.
However, if looking to support Fyne in a bigger way on your operating system then you can install some utilities that help to make a more complete experience.

## Additional apps

It is recommended that you install the following additional apps:

| app           | go install                          | description                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fyne_settings | `fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_settings` | A GUI for managing your global Fyne settings like theme and scaling    |
| apps          | `github.com/fyne-io/apps`           | A graphical installer for the Fyne apps listed at https://apps.fyne.io |

These are optional applications but can help to create a more complete desktop experience.

## FyneDesk (Linux / BSD)

To go all the way with Fyne on your desktop / laptop computer you could install [FyneDesk](https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk) as well :)

&gt;*The modern internet built on public clouds is increasingly threatening your personal data privacy. As reliance on services like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Facebook grows, so does the risk to your digital autonomy. Your data lives on their servers, subject to their terms, tracking, and potential censorship.*
&gt;
&gt;*It&#039;s time for a change.* 

![Personal Cloud](https://app.cdn.olares.com/github/olares/public-cloud-to-personal-cloud.jpg)
We believe you have a fundamental right to control your digital life. The most effective way to uphold this right is by hosting your data locally, on your own hardware.

Olares is an **open-source personal cloud operating system** designed to empower you to own and manage your digital assets locally. Instead of relying on public cloud services, you can deploy powerful open-source alternatives locally on Olares, such as Ollama for hosting LLMs, ComfyUI for image generation, and Perplexica for private, AI-driven search and reasoning. Imagine the power of the cloud, but with you in complete command.

Just as Public clouds offer IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS layers, Olares provides open-source alternatives to each of these layers.

  ![Tech Stacks](https://app.cdn.olares.com/github/olares/olares-architecture.jpg)

 For detailed description of each component, refer to [Olares architecture](https://docs.olares.com/manual/concepts/system-architecture.html).

#### Two-way audio

Supported sources:

- [RTSP cameras](#source-rtsp) with [ONVIF Profile T](https://www.onvif.org/specs/stream/ONVIF-Streaming-Spec.pdf) (back channel connection)
- [DVRIP](#source-dvrip) cameras

Two-way audio can be used in browser with [WebRTC](#module-webrtc) technology. The browser will give access to the microphone only for HTTPS sites ([read more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52759992/how-to-access-camera-and-microphone-in-chrome-without-https)).

go2rtc also supports [play audio](#stream-to-camera) files and live streams on this cameras.

#### Source: RTSP

```yaml
streams:
  sonoff_camera: rtsp://rtsp:12345678@192.168.1.123/av_stream/ch0
  dahua_camera:
    - rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=0&amp;unicast=true&amp;proto=Onvif
    - rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=1#backchannel=0
  amcrest_doorbell:
    - rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.123:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=0#backchannel=0
  unifi_camera: rtspx://192.168.1.123:7441/fD6ouM72bWoFijxK
  glichy_camera: ffmpeg:rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.123/live/ch00_1 
```

**Recommendations**

- **Amcrest Doorbell** users may want to disable two-way audio, because with an active stream, you won&#039;t have a working call button. You need to add `#backchannel=0` to the end of your RTSP link in YAML config file
- **Dahua Doorbell** users may want to change [audio codec](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/issues/49#issuecomment-2127107379) for proper 2-way audio. Make sure not to request backchannel multiple times by adding `#backchannel=0` to other stream sources of the same doorbell. The `unicast=true&amp;proto=Onvif` is preferred for 2-way audio as this makes the doorbell accept multiple codecs for the incoming audio
- **Reolink** users may want NOT to use RTSP protocol at all, some camera models have a very awful, unusable stream implementation
- **Ubiquiti UniFi** users may want to disable HTTPS verification. Use `rtspx://` prefix instead of `rtsps://`. And don&#039;t use `?enableSrtp` [suffix](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/issues/81)
- **TP-Link Tapo** users may skip login and password, because go2rtc support login [without them](https://drmnsamoliu.github.io/video.html)
- If your camera has two RTSP links, you can add both as sources. This is useful when streams have different codecs, for example AAC audio with main stream and PCMU/PCMA audio with second stream
- If the stream from your camera is glitchy, try using [ffmpeg source](#source-ffmpeg). It will not add CPU load if you don&#039;t use transcoding
- If the stream from your camera is very glitchy, try to use transcoding with [ffmpeg source](#source-ffmpeg)

**Other options**

Format: `rtsp...#{param1}#{param2}#{param3}`

- Add custom timeout `#timeout=30` (in seconds)
- Ignore audio - `#media=video` or ignore video - `#media=audio` 
- Ignore two-way audio API `#backchannel=0` - important for some glitchy cameras
- Use WebSocket transport `#transport=ws...`

**RTSP over WebSocket**

```yaml
streams:
  # WebSocket with authorization, RTSP - without
  axis-rtsp-ws:  rtsp://192.168.1.123:4567/axis-media/media.amp?overview=0&amp;camera=1&amp;resolution=1280x720&amp;videoframeskipmode=empty&amp;Axis-Orig-Sw=true#transport=ws://user:pass@192.168.1.123:4567/rtsp-over-websocket
  # WebSocket without authorization, RTSP - with
  dahua-rtsp-ws: rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=1&amp;proto=Private3#transport=ws://192.168.1.123/rtspoverwebsocket
```

#### Source: RTMP

You can get a stream from an RTMP server, for example [Nginx with nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).

```yaml
streams:
  rtmp_stream: rtmp://192.168.1.123/live/camera1
```

#### Source: HTTP

Support Content-Type:

- **HTTP-FLV** (`video/x-flv`) - same as RTMP, but over HTTP
- **HTTP-JPEG** (`image/jpeg`) - camera snapshot link, can be converted by go2rtc to MJPEG stream
- **HTTP-MJPEG** (`multipart/x`) - simple MJPEG stream over HTTP
- **MPEG-TS** (`video/mpeg`) - legacy [streaming format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_transport_stream)

Source also supports HTTP and TCP streams with autodetection for different formats: **MJPEG**, **H.264/H.265 bitstream**, **MPEG-TS**.

```yaml
streams:
  # [HTTP-FLV] stream in video/x-flv format
  http_flv: http://192.168.1.123:20880/api/camera/stream/780900131155/657617
  
  # [JPEG] snapshots from Dahua camera, will be converted to MJPEG stream
  dahua_snap: http://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cgi-bin/snapshot.cgi?channel=1

  # [MJPEG] stream will be proxied without modification
  http_mjpeg: https://mjpeg.sanford.io/count.mjpeg

  # [MJPEG or H.264/H.265 bitstream or MPEG-TS]
  tcp_magic: tcp://192.168.1.123:12345

  # Add custom header
  custom_header: &quot;https://mjpeg.sanford.io/count.mjpeg#header=Authorization: Bearer XXX&quot;
```

**PS.** Dahua camera has a bug: if you select MJPEG codec for RTSP second stream, snapshot won&#039;t work.

#### Source: ONVIF

*[New in v1.5.0](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/releases/tag/v1.5.0)*

The source is not very useful if you already know RTSP and snapshot links for your camera. But it can be useful if you don&#039;t.

**WebUI &gt; Add** webpage support ONVIF autodiscovery. Your server must be on the same subnet as the camera. If you use Docker, you must use &quot;network host&quot;.

```yaml
streams:
  dahua1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123
  reolink1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123:8000
  tapo1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123:2020
```

#### Source: FFmpeg

You can get any stream, file or device via FFmpeg and push it to go2rtc. The app will automatically start FFmpeg with the proper arguments when someone starts watching the stream.

- FFmpeg preistalled for **Docker** and **Hass Add-on** users
- **Hass Add-on** users can target files from [/media](https://www.home-assistant.io/more-info/local-media/setup-media/) folder

Format: `ffmpeg:{input}#{param1}#{param2}#{param3}`. Examples:

```yaml
streams:
  # [FILE] all tracks will be copied without transcoding codecs
  file1: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4

  # [FILE] video will be transcoded to H264, audio will be skipped
  file2: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4#video=h264

  # [FILE] video will be copied, audio will be transcoded to PCMU
  file3: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4#video=copy#audio=pcmu

  # [HLS] video will be copied, audio will be skipped
  hls: ffmpeg:https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_16x9/gear5/prog_index.m3u8#video=copy

  # [MJPEG] video will be transcoded to H264
  mjpeg: ffmpeg:http://185.97.122.128/cgi-bin/faststream.jpg#video=h264

  # [RTSP] video with rotation, should be transcoded, so select H264
  rotate: ffmpeg:rtsp://12345678@192.168.1.123/av_stream/ch0#video=h264#rotate=90
```

All transcoding formats have [built-in templates](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/blob/master/internal/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.go): `h264`, `h265`, `opus`, `pcmu`, `pcmu/16000`, `pcmu/48000`, `pcma`, `pcma/16000`, `pcma/48000`, `aac`, `aac/16000`.

But you can override them via YAML config. You can also add your own formats to the config and use them with source params.

```yaml
ffmpeg:
  bin: ffmpeg  # path to ffmpeg binary
  h264: &quot;-codec:v libx264 -g:v 30 -preset:v superfast -tune:v zerolatency -profile:v main -level:v 4.1&quot;
  mycodec: &quot;-any args that supported by ffmpeg...&quot;
  myinput: &quot;-fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -timeout 5000000 -i {input}&quot;
  myraw: &quot;-ss 00:00:20&quot;
```

- You can use go2rtc stream name as ffmpeg input (ex. `ffmpeg:camera1#video=h264`)
- You can use `video` and `audio` params multiple times (ex. `#video=copy#audio=copy#audio=pcmu`)
- You can use `rotate` param with `90`, `180`, `270` or `-90` values, important with transcoding (ex. `#video=h264#rotate=90`)
- You can use `width` and/or `height` params, important with transcoding (ex. `#video=h264#width=1280`)
- You can use `drawtext` to add a timestamp (ex. `drawtext=x=2:y=2:fontsize=12:fontcolor=white:box=1:boxcolor=black`)
  - This will greatly increase the CPU of the server, even with hardware acceleration
- You can use `raw` param for any additional FFmpeg arguments (ex. `#raw=-vf transpose=1`)
- You can use `input` param to override default input template (ex. `#input=rtsp/udp` will change RTSP transport from TCP to UDP+TCP)
  - You can use raw

**遇到任何问题，务必要先看 [各种疑难杂症](https://github.com/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp/issues/56)**。

上面的 **疑难杂症** 列表后，还是解决不了你的部署问题，那么强烈推荐使用我写的另外一个工具：[xpzouying/x-mcp](https://github.com/xpzouying/x-mcp)，这个工具不需要你进行部署，只需要通过浏览器插件就能驱动你的 MCP，对于非技术同学来说更加友好。

**小红书基础运营知识**

- **标题：（非常重要）小红书要求标题不超过 20 个字**
- **正文：（非常重要）：正文不能超过 1000 个字**
- 当前支持图文发送以及视频发送：从推荐的角度看，图文的流量会比视频以及纯文字的更好。
- （低优先级）可以考虑纯文字的支持。1. 个人感觉纯文字会大大增加运营的复杂度；2. 纯文字在我的使用场景的价值较低。
- Tags：现已支持。添加合适的 Tags 能带来更多的流量。
- 根据本人实操，小红书每天的发帖量应该是 **50 篇**。
- **（非常重要）小红书的同一个账号不允许在多个网页端登录**，如果你登录了当前 xiaohongshu-mcp 后，就不要再在其他的网页端登录该账号，否则就会把当前 MCP 的账号“踢出登录”。你可以使用移动 App 端进行查看当前账号信息。

**风险说明**

1. 该项目是在自己的另外一个项目的基础上开源出来的，原来的项目稳定运行一年多，没有出现过封号的情况，只有出现过 Cookies 过期需要重新登录。
2. 我是使用 Claude Code 接入，稳定自动化运营数周后，验证没有问题后开源。

该项目是基于学习的目的，禁止一切违法行为。

**Q:** 为什么检查登录用户名显示 `xiaghgngshu-mcp`？  
**A:** 用户名是写死的。

---

**Q:** 显示发布成功后，但实际上没有显示？  
**A:** 排查步骤如下：  
1. 使用 **非无头模式** 重新发布一次。  
2. 更换 **不同的内容** 重新发布。  
3. 登录网页版小红书，查看账号是否被 **风控限制网页版发布**。  
4. 检查 **图片大小** 是否过大。  
5. 确认 **图片路径中没有中文字符**。  
6. 若使用网络图片地址，请确认 **图片链接可正常访问**。
