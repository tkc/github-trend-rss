Organize your photos &amp; videos, chats &amp; messages, location history, social media content, contacts, and more into a single cohesive timeline on your own computer where you can keep them alive forever.

Timelinize lets you import your data from practically anywhere: your computer, phone, online accounts, GPS-enabled radios, various apps and programs, contact lists, cameras, and more.

**[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/C9dCnTW6qV)** to discuss!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; I am looking for a better name for this project. If you have an idea for a good name that is short, relevant, unique, and available, [I&#039;d love to hear it!](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues/2)

## Screenshots

These were captured using a dev repository of mine filled with a subset of my real data, so I&#039;ve run Timelinize in obfuscation mode: images and videos are blurred (except profile pictures---need to fix that); names, identifiers, and locations around sensitive areas are all randomized, and text has been replaced with random words so that the string is about the same length.

(I hope to make a video tour soon.)

**Please remember this is an early alpha preview, and the software is very much evolving and improving. And you can help!**

| ---- | ---- |
![WIP Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293cbe57-ac75-4c4b-b78a-b75f6d442d99) WIP dashboard. **Very** WIP. The bubble chart is particularly interesting as it shows you what kinds of data are most common at which times of day throughout the years. | ![Timeline view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f808c4-7b0e-4ad0-b12a-6398f6321272) The classic timeline view is a combination of all data grouped by types and time segments for reconstructing a day or other custom time period.
![Item view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f5671c-df85-4af5-9f67-6358e7489442) Viewing an item shows all the information about it, regardless of type: text, photo, live photo, video, location, etc. | ![File picker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf2482e-58a5-434f-a0d2-f9b1274af106) I had to make a custom file picker since browser APIs are too limiting. This is how you&#039;ll import most of your data into your timeline, but this flow is being revised soon.
![3D map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051031c1-0659-4388-b01f-475bb4d24490) The large map view is capable of 3D exploration, showing your memories right where they happened with a color-coded path that represents time. | ![Map showing non-geolocated data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ddbe3cd-4bdc-4d3a-be92-d9c41e29ee1b) Because Timelinize is entity-aware and supports multiple data sources, it can show data on a map even if it doesn&#039;t have geolocation information. That&#039;s what the gray dots or pins represent. In this example, a text message was received while at church, even though it doesn&#039;t have any geolocation info associated with it directly.
![Entities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832c6bce-029c-4abf-943e-84253458a9f7) Timelinize treats entities (people, pets/animals, organizations, etc.) as first-class data points which you can filter and organize. | ![Merge entities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932259b1-fc1d-40bc-b27d-a58e37537c4c) Timelinize will automatically recognize the same entity across data sources with enough information, but if it isn&#039;t possible automatically, you can manually merge entities with a click.
![Conversations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0973df3c-eba9-49b8-b369-0e44f4120c37) Conversations are aggregated across data sources that have messaging capabilities. They become emergent from the database by querying relationships between items and entities. | ![Conversation view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ece383-6702-47ed-8f11-6c95af0cc3de) In this conversation view, you can see messages exchanged with this person across both Facebook and SMS/text message are displayed together. Reactions are also supported.
![Gallery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe89db8e-66b1-4854-9d47-a774bf20961f) A gallery displays photos and videos, but not just those in your photo library: it includes pictures and memes sent via messages, photos and videos uploaded to social media, and any other photos/videos in your data. You can always filter to drill down.


## How it works

1. [Obtain your data.](https://timelinize.com/docs/data-preparation) This usually involves exporting your data from apps, online accounts, or devices. For example, requesting an archive from Google Takeout. (Apple iCloud, Facebook, Twitter/X, Strava, Instagram, etc. all offer similar functionality for GDPR compliance.) Do this early/soon, because some services take days to provide your data.
2. Import your data using Timelinize. You don&#039;t need to extract or decompress .tar or .zip archives; Timelinize will attempt to recognize your data in its original format and folder structure. All the data you import is indexed in a SQLite database and stored on disk organized by date -- no obfuscation or proprietary formats; you can simply browse your files if you wish.
3. Explore and organize! Timelinize has a UI that portrays data using various projections and filters. It can recall moments from your past and help you view your life more comprehensively. (It&#039;s a great living family history tool.)
4. Repeat steps 1-3 as often as desired. Timelinize will skip any existing data that is the same and only import new content. You could do this every few weeks or months for busy accounts that are most important to you.

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Timelinize is in active development and is still considered unstable. The schema is still changing, necessitating starting over from a clean slate when updating. Always keep your original source data. Expect to delete and recreate your timelines as you upgrade during this alpha development period.

## Download and run

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/releases/latest) for your platform.

See the website for [installation instructions](https://timelinize.com/docs/install).

## Develop

See our [project wiki](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/) for instructions on [compiling from source](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/Develop).


## Command line interface

Timelinize has a symmetric HTTP API and CLI. When an HTTP API endpoint is created in the code, it automatically adds to the command line as well.

Run `timelinize help` (or `go run main.go help` if you&#039;re running from source) to view the list of commands, which are also HTTP endpoints. JSON or form inputs are converted to command line args/flags that represent the JSON schema or form fields.

&lt;!-- &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Wails UI info (no longer used)&lt;/summary&gt;

## Wails v2 (native GUI) info

The last commit that used Wails (v2) was b9b80838b2b92501139f2f0c5fab63921a7e6502.
That can be used as a reference if we ever switch back to Wails. The last working
commit that had Wails that was released as a dev preview was
bcb0f732e01e5b0e34a142a35b658a1f328c4c6d.

In July-August 2023 we transitioned away from Wails and went to a client/server
model for stability and flexibility. Wails itself was great, the main problem
was the poor performance of Webkit2GTK, even on Mac it was pretty bad (frequent
crashes).

The instructions below are preserved here for reference in case that comes
in handy, though the commits above also have this in their READMEs:

### Development

Run commands in the project root:

#### Linux, macOS

```bash
$ wails dev
```

#### Windows

```powershell
$env:CC=&quot;zig cc&quot;; $env:CXX=&quot;zig c++&quot;; wails dev
```

Or, if cross-compiling:

```powershell
&gt; $env:CC=&quot;zig cc -target x86_64-windows&quot;; $env:CXX=&quot;zig c++ -target x86_64-windows&quot;; wails dev
```

&lt;/details&gt; --&gt;

## Setup Development Environment
Dev Container setup is provided for easy development using GitHub Codespaces or Visual Studio Code with the DevContainers extension.

### Getting started with VSCode
1. Make sure you have the following installed:

	- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
	- [DevContainers for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. Open this project in VSCode
3. Go to the __Remote Explorer__ on Activity Bar
4. Click on __New Dev Container (+)__
5. Click on __Open Current Folder in Container__

This sets up a docker container with all the dependencies required for building this project. You can get started with contributing quickly.


## Motivation and vision

(For roadmap, see [issues tagged `long-term 🔭`](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22long-term%20%F0%9F%94%AD%22).)

The motivation for this project is two-fold. Both press upon me with a sense of urgency, which is why I dedicated some nights and weekends to work on this.

1. Connecting with my family -- both living and deceased -- is important to me and my close relatives. But I wish we had more insights into the lives of those who came before us. What was important to them? Where did they live / travel / spend their time? What lessons did they learn? How did global and local events -- or heck, even the weather -- affect them? What hardships did they endure? What would they have wanted to remember? What would it be like to talk to them? A lot of this could not be known unless they wrote it all down. But these days, we have that data for ourselves. What better time than right now to start collecting personal histories from all available sources and develop a rich timeline of our life for our family, or even just for our own reference and nostalgia.

2. Our lives are better-documented than any before us, but the record of our life is more ephemeral than any before us, too. We lose control of our data by relying on centralized, proprietary apps and cloud services which are useful today, and gone tomorrow. I wrote Timelinize because now is the time to liberate my data from corporations who don&#039;t own it, yet who have the only copy of it. This reality has made me feel uneasy for years, and it&#039;s not going away soon. Timelinize makes it bearable.

Imagine being able to pull up a single screen with your data from any and all of your online accounts and services -- while offline. And there you see so many aspects of your life at a glance: your photos and videos, social media posts, locations on a map and how you got there, emails and letters, documents, health and physical activities, mental and emotional wellness, and maybe even music you listened to, for any given day. You can &quot;zoom out&quot; and get the big picture. Machine learning algorithms could suggest major clusters based on your content to summarize your days, months, or years, and from that, even recommend printing physical memorabilia. It&#039;s like a highly-detailed, automated journal, fully in your control, which you can add to in the app: augment it with your own thoughts like a regular journal.

Then cross-reference your own timeline with a global public timeline: see how locations you went to changed over time, or what major news events may have affected you, or what the political/social climate -- or the literal climate -- was like at the time. For example, you may wonder, &quot;Why did the family stay inside so much of the summer one year?&quot; You could then see, &quot;Oh, because it was 110 F (43 C) degrees for two months straight.&quot;

Or translate the projection sideways, and instead of looking at time cross-sections, look at cross-sections of your timeline by media type: photos, posts, location, sentiment. Look at plots, charts, graphs, of your physical activity.

Or view projections by space instead of time: view interrelations between items on a map, even items that don&#039;t have location data, because the database is entity-aware. So if a person receives a text message and the same person has location information at about the same time from a photo or GPS device, then the text message can appear on a map too, reminding you where you first got the text with the news about your nephew&#039;s birth.

And all of this runs on your own computer: no one else has access to it, no one else owns it, but you.

And if everyone had their own timeline, in theory they could be merged into a global supertimeline to become a thorough record of the human race, all without the need for centralizing our data on cloud services that are controlled by greedy corporations.

## History

I&#039;ve been working on this project since about 2013, even before I conceptualized [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com). My initial vision was to create an automated backup of my Picasa albums that I could store on my own hard drive. This project was called Photobak. Picasa eventually became Google Photos, and about the same time I realized I wanted to backup my photos posted to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, too. And while I was at it, why not include my Google Location History to augment the location data from the photos. The vision continued to expand as I realized that my family could use this too, so the schema was upgraded to support multiple people/entities as well. This could allow us to merge databases, or timelines, as family members pass, or as they share parts of their timeline around with each other. Timelinize is the mature evolution of the original project that is now designed to be a comprehensive, highly detailed archive of one&#039;s life through digital (or _digitized_) content. An authoritative, unified record that is easy to preserve and organize.

## License

This project is licensed with AGPL. I chose this license because I do not want others to make proprietary or commercial software using this package. The point of this project is liberation of and control over one&#039;s own, personal data, and I want to ensure that this project won&#039;t be used in anything that would perpetuate the walled garden dilemma we already face today. Even if the future of this project ever has proprietary source code, I can ensure it will stay aligned with my values and the project&#039;s original goals.

Gin-vue-admin 是一套为快速研发准备的一整套前后端分离架构式的开源框架，旨在快速搭建中小型项目。

Gin-vue-admin 的成长离不开大家的支持，如果你愿意为 gin-vue-admin 贡献代码或提供建议，请阅读以下内容。

#### 1.2.1 Issue 规范
- issue 仅用于提交 Bug 或 Feature 以及设计相关的内容，其它内容可能会被直接关闭。
									      
- 在提交 issue 之前，请搜索相关内容是否已被提出。

#### 1.2.2 Pull Request 规范
- 请先 fork 一份到自己的项目下，不要直接在仓库下建分支。

- commit 信息要以`[文件名]: 描述信息` 的形式填写，例如 `README.md: fix xxx bug`。

- 如果是修复 bug，请在 PR 中给出描述信息。

- 合并代码需要两名维护人员参与：一人进行 review 后 approve，另一人再次 review，通过后即可合并。

## 2. 使用说明

```
- node版本 &gt; v18.16.0
- golang版本 &gt;= v1.22
- IDE推荐：Goland
```

### 2.1 server项目

使用 `Goland` 等编辑工具，打开server目录，不可以打开 gin-vue-admin 根目录

```bash

# 克隆项目
git clone https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin.git
# 进入server文件夹
cd server

# 使用 go mod 并安装go依赖包
go generate

# 运行
go run . 

```

### 2.2 web项目

```bash
# 进入web文件夹
cd web

# 安装依赖
npm install

# 启动web项目
npm run serve
```

### 2.3 swagger自动化API文档

#### 2.3.1 安装 swagger

``` shell
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

#### 2.3.2 生成API文档

```` shell
cd server
swag init
````

&gt; 执行上面的命令后，server目录下会出现docs文件夹里的 `docs.go`, `swagger.json`, `swagger.yaml` 三个文件更新，启动go服务之后, 在浏览器输入 [http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html) 即可查看swagger文档

### 2.4 VSCode工作区

#### 2.4.1 开发

使用`VSCode`打开根目录下的工作区文件`gin-vue-admin.code-workspace`，在边栏可以看到三个虚拟目录：`backend`、`frontend`、`root`。

#### 2.4.2 运行/调试

在运行和调试中也可以看到三个task：`Backend`、`Frontend`、`Both (Backend &amp; Frontend)`。运行`Both (Backend &amp; Frontend)`可以同时启动前后端项目。

#### 2.4.3 settings

在工作区配置文件中有`go.toolsEnvVars`字段，是用于`VSCode`自身的go工具环境变量。此外在多go版本的系统中，可以通过`gopath`、`go.goroot`指定运行版本。

```json
    &quot;go.gopath&quot;: null,
    &quot;go.goroot&quot;: null,
```

## 3. 技术选型

- 前端：用基于 [Vue](https://vuejs.org) 的 [Element](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element) 构建基础页面。
- 后端：用 [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) 快速搭建基础restful风格API，[Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) 是一个go语言编写的Web框架。
- 数据库：采用`MySql` &gt; (5.7) 版本 数据库引擎 InnoDB，使用 [gorm](http://gorm.cn) 实现对数据库的基本操作。
- 缓存：使用`Redis`实现记录当前活跃用户的`jwt`令牌并实现多点登录限制。
- API文档：使用`Swagger`构建自动化文档。
- 配置文件：使用 [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) 和 [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) 实现`yaml`格式的配置文件。
- 日志：使用 [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) 实现日志记录。

## 5. 主要功能

- 权限管理：基于`jwt`和`casbin`实现的权限管理。
- 文件上传下载：实现基于`七牛云`, `阿里云`, `腾讯云` 的文件上传操作(请开发自己去各个平台的申请对应 `token` 或者对应`key`)。
- 分页封装：前端使用 `mixins` 封装分页，分页方法调用 `mixins` 即可。
- 用户管理：系统管理员分配用户角色和角色权限。
- 角色管理：创建权限控制的主要对象，可以给角色分配不同api权限和菜单权限。
- 菜单管理：实现用户动态菜单配置，实现不同角色不同菜单。
- api管理：不同用户可调用的api接口的权限不同。
- 配置管理：配置文件可前台修改(在线体验站点不开放此功能)。
- 条件搜索：增加条件搜索示例。
- restful示例：可以参考用户管理模块中的示例API。
	- 前端文件参考: [web/src/view/superAdmin/api/api.vue](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/master/web/src/view/superAdmin/api/api.vue)
    - 后台文件参考: [server/router/sys_api.go](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/master/server/router/sys_api.go)
- 多点登录限制：需要在`config.yaml`中把`system`中的`use-multipoint`修改为true(需要自行配置Redis和Config中的Redis参数，测试阶段，有bug请及时反馈)。
- 分片上传：提供文件分片上传和大文件分片上传功能示例。
- 表单生成器：表单生成器借助 [@Variant Form](https://github.com/vform666/variant-form) 。

Istio is an open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. Istio’s powerful features provide a uniform and more efficient way to secure, connect, and monitor services. Istio is the path to load balancing, service-to-service authentication, and monitoring – with few or no service code changes.

## Introduction

[Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/) is an open platform for providing a uniform way to [integrate
microservices](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/microservices-istio/), manage [traffic flow](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/) across microservices, enforce policies
and aggregate telemetry data. Istio&#039;s control plane provides an abstraction
layer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes.

Istio is composed of these components:

- **Envoy** - Sidecar proxies per microservice to handle ingress/egress traffic
   between services in the cluster and from a service to external
   services. The proxies form a _secure microservice mesh_ providing a rich
   set of functions like discovery, rich layer-7 routing, circuit breakers,
   policy enforcement and telemetry recording/reporting
   functions.

  &gt; Note: The service mesh is not an overlay network. It
  &gt; simplifies and enhances how microservices in an application talk to each
  &gt; other over the network provided by the underlying platform.

- **Istiod** - The Istio control plane. It provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management. It consists of the following sub-components:

    - **Pilot** - Responsible for configuring the proxies at runtime.

    - **Citadel** - Responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.

    - **Galley** - Responsible for validating, ingesting, aggregating, transforming and distributing config within Istio.

- **Operator** - The component provides user friendly options to operate the Istio service mesh.

## Repositories

The Istio project is divided across a few GitHub repositories:

- [istio/api](https://github.com/istio/api). This repository defines
component-level APIs and common configuration formats for the Istio platform.

- [istio/community](https://github.com/istio/community). This repository contains
information on the Istio community, including the various documents that govern
the Istio open source project.

- [istio/istio](README.md). This is the main code repository. It hosts Istio&#039;s
core components, install artifacts, and sample programs. It includes:

    - [istioctl](istioctl/). This directory contains code for the
[_istioctl_](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/) command line utility.

    - [pilot](pilot/). This directory
contains platform-specific code to populate the
[abstract service model](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#pilot), dynamically reconfigure the proxies
when the application topology changes, as well as translate
[routing rules](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/) into proxy specific configuration.

    - [security](security/). This directory contains [security](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/) related code,
including Citadel (acting as Certificate Authority), citadel agent, etc.

- [istio/proxy](https://github.com/istio/proxy). The Istio proxy contains
extensions to the [Envoy proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) (in the form of
Envoy filters) that support authentication, authorization, and telemetry collection.

- [istio/ztunnel](https://github.com/istio/ztunnel). The repository contains the Rust implementation of the ztunnel
component of Ambient mesh.

- [istio/client-go](https://github.com/istio/client-go). This repository defines
  auto-generated Kubernetes clients for interacting with Istio resources programmatically.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Only the `istio/api` and `istio/client-go` repositories expose stable interfaces intended for direct usage as libraries.

## Issue management

We use GitHub to track all of our bugs and feature requests. Each issue we track has a variety of metadata:

- **Epic**. An epic represents a feature area for Istio as a whole. Epics are fairly broad in scope and are basically product-level things.
Each issue is ultimately part of an epic.

- **Milestone**. Each issue is assigned a milestone. This is 0.1, 0.2, ..., or &#039;Nebulous Future&#039;. The milestone indicates when we
think the issue should get addressed.

- **Priority**. Each issue has a priority which is represented by the column in the [Prioritization](https://github.com/orgs/istio/projects/6) project. Priority can be one of
P0, P1, P2, or &gt;P2. The priority indicates how important it is to address the issue within the milestone. P0 says that the
milestone cannot be considered achieved if the issue isn&#039;t resolved.

## What is Milvus?

🐦 [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) is a high-performance vector database built for scale. It powers AI applications by efficiently organizing and searching vast amounts of unstructured data, such as text, images, and multi-modal information.

🧑‍💻 Written in Go and C++, Milvus implements hardware acceleration for CPU/GPU to achieve best-in-class vector search performance. Thanks to its [fully-distributed and K8s-native architecture](https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md#What-Makes-Milvus-so-Scalable), Milvus can scale horizontally, handle tens of thousands of search queries on billions of vectors, and keep data fresh with real-time streaming updates. Milvus also supports [Standalone mode](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) for single machine deployment. [Milvus Lite](https://milvus.io/docs/milvus_lite.md) is a lightweight version good for quickstart in python with `pip install`.

Want to use Milvus with zero setup? Try out [Zilliz Cloud ☁️](https://cloud.zilliz.com/signup?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2024-11-04_web_github-readme_global) for free. Milvus is available as a fully managed service on Zilliz Cloud, with [Serverless](https://zilliz.com/serverless?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2024-11-04_web_github-readme_global), [Dedicated](https://zilliz.com/cloud?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2024-11-04_web_github-readme_global) and [BYOC](https://zilliz.com/bring-your-own-cloud?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2024-11-04_web_github-readme_global) options available.

The Milvus open-source project is
under [LF AI &amp; Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/milvus/), distributed with [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/blob/master/LICENSE) License, with Zilliz as its major contributor.

## Quickstart

```python
$ pip install -U pymilvus
```
This installs `pymilvus`, the Python SDK for Milvus. Use `MilvusClient` to create a client:
```python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient
```

* `pymilvus` also includes Milvus Lite for quickstart. To create a local vector database, simply instantiate a client with a local file name for persisting data:

  ```python
  client = MilvusClient(&quot;milvus_demo.db&quot;)
  ```

* You can also specify the credentials to connect to your deployed [Milvus server](https://milvus.io/docs/authenticate.md?tab=docker) or [Zilliz Cloud](https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/quick-start):

  ```python
  client = MilvusClient(
    uri=&quot;&lt;endpoint_of_self_hosted_milvus_or_zilliz_cloud&gt;&quot;,
    token=&quot;&lt;username_and_password_or_zilliz_cloud_api_key&gt;&quot;)
  ```

With the client, you can create collection:
```python
client.create_collection(
    collection_name=&quot;demo_collection&quot;,
    dimension=768,  # The vectors we will use in this demo have 768 dimensions
)
```

Ingest data:
```python
res = client.insert(collection_name=&quot;demo_collection&quot;, data=data)
```

Perform vector search:

```python
query_vectors = embedding_fn.encode_queries([&quot;Who is Alan Turing?&quot;, &quot;What is AI?&quot;])
res = client.search(
    collection_name=&quot;demo_collection&quot;,  # target collection
    data=query_vectors,  # a list of one or more query vectors, supports batch
    limit=2,  # how many results to return (topK)
    output_fields=[&quot;vector&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;subject&quot;],  # what fields to return
)
```

## Why Milvus

Milvus is designed to handle vector search at scale. It stores vectors, which are learned representations of unstructured data, together with other scalar data types such as integers, strings, and JSON objects. Users can conduct efficient vector search with metadata filtering or hybrid search. Here are why developers choose Milvus as the vector database for AI applications:

**High Performance at Scale and High Availability**  
  * Milvus features a [distributed architecture](https://milvus.io/docs/architecture_overview.md ) that separates [compute](https://milvus.io/docs/data_processing.md#Data-query) and [storage](https://milvus.io/docs/data_processing.md#Data-insertion). Milvus can horizontally scale and adapt to diverse traffic patterns, achieving optimal performance by independently increasing query nodes for read-heavy workload and data node for write-heavy workload. The stateless microservices on K8s allow [quick recovery](https://milvus.io/docs/coordinator_ha.md#Coordinator-HA) from failure, ensuring high availability. The support for [replicas](https://milvus.io/docs/replica.md) further enhances fault tolerance and throughput by loading data segments on multiple query nodes. See [benchmark](https://zilliz.com/vector-database-benchmark-tool) for performance comparison.


**Support for Various Vector Index Types and Hardware Acceleration**  
  * Milvus separates the system and core vector search engine, allowing it to support all major vector index types that are optimized for different scenarios, including HNSW, IVF, FLAT (brute-force), SCANN, and DiskANN, with [quantization-based](https://milvus.io/docs/index.md?tab=floating#IVFPQ) variations and [mmap](https://milvus.io/docs/mmap.md). Milvus optimizes vector search for advanced features such as [metadata filtering](https://milvus.io/docs/scalar_index.md#Scalar-Index) and [range search](https://milvus.io/docs/single-vector-search.md#Range-search). Additionally, Milvus implements hardware acceleration to enhance vector search performance and supports GPU indexing, such as NVIDIA&#039;s [CAGRA](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs).


**Flexible Multi-tenancy and Hot/Cold Storage**
  * Milvus supports [multi-tenancy](https://milvus.io/docs/multi_tenancy.md#Multi-tenancy-strategies) through isolation at database, collection, partition, or partition key level. The flexible strategies allow a single cluster to handle hundreds to millions of tenants, also ensures optimized search performance and flexible access control. Milvus enhances cost-effectiveness with hot/cold storage. Frequently accessed hot data can be stored in memory or on SSDs for better performance, while less-accessed cold data is kept on slower, cost-effective storage. This mechanism can significantly reduce costs while maintaining high performance for critical tasks.

**Sparse Vector for Full Text Search and Hybrid Search**
  * In addition to semantic search through dense vector, Milvus also natively supports [full text search](https://milvus.io/docs/full-text-search.md) with BM25 as well as learned sparse embeddings such as SPLADE and BGE-M3. Users can store sparse vectors and dense vectors in the same collection, and define functions to rerank results from multiple search requests. See examples of [Hybrid Search with semantic search + full text search](https://milvus.io/docs/full_text_search_with_milvus.md).

**Data Security and Fine-grain Access Control**
  * Milvus ensures data security by implementing mandatory user authentication, TLS encryption, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). User authentication ensures that only authorized users with valid credentials can access the database, while TLS encryption secures all communications within the network. Additionally, RBAC allows for fine-grained access control by assigning specific permissions to users based on their roles. These features make Milvus a robust and secure choice for enterprise applications, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.

Milvus is trusted by AI developers to build applications such as text and image search, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and recommendation systems. Milvus powers [many mission-critical businesses](https://milvus.io/use-cases) for startups and enterprises.

## Benchmarks 

Some good benchmarks VictoriaMetrics achieved:

* **Minimal memory footprint**: handling millions of unique timeseries with [10x less RAM](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) than InfluxDB, up to [7x less RAM](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Highly scalable and performance** for [data ingestion](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and [querying](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4), [20x outperforms](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.
* **High data compression**: [70x more data points](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4) may be stored into limited storage than TimescaleDB, [7x less storage](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) space is required than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Reducing storage costs**: [10x more effective](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/casestudies/#grammarly) than Graphite according to the Grammarly case study.
* **A single-node VictoriaMetrics** can replace medium-sized clusters built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. See [VictoriaMetrics vs Thanos](https://medium.com/@valyala/comparing-thanos-to-victoriametrics-cluster-b193bea1683), [Measuring vertical scalability](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae), [Remote write storage wars - PromCon 2019](https://promcon.io/2019-munich/talks/remote-write-storage-wars/).
* **Optimized for storage**: [Works well with high-latency IO](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and low IOPS (HDD and network storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># MinIO Quickstart Guide

[![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/minio/minio.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20V3-blue)](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE)

[![MinIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/.github/logo.svg?sanitize=true)](https://min.io)

MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage solution released under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license.
Designed for speed and scalability, it powers AI/ML, analytics, and data-intensive workloads with industry-leading performance.

- S3 API Compatible – Seamless integration with existing S3 tools
- Built for AI &amp; Analytics – Optimized for large-scale data pipelines
- High Performance – Ideal for demanding storage workloads.

This README provides instructions for building MinIO from source and deploying onto baremetal hardware.
Use the [MinIO Documentation](https://github.com/minio/docs) project to build and host a local copy of the documentation.

## MinIO is Open Source Software

We designed MinIO as Open Source software for the Open Source software community.
We encourage the community to remix, redesign, and reshare MinIO under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

All usage of MinIO in your application stack requires validation against AGPLv3 obligations, which include but are not limited to the release of modified code to the community from which you have benefited.
Any commercial/proprietary usage of the AGPLv3 software, including repackaging or reselling services/features, is done at your own risk.

The AGPLv3 provides no obligation by any party to support, maintain, or warranty the original or any modified work.
All support is provided on a best-effort basis through Github and our [Slack](https//slack.min.io) channel, and any member of the community is welcome to contribute and assist others in their usage of the software.

MinIO [AIStor](https://www.min.io/product/aistor) includes enterprise-grade support and licensing for workloads which require commercial or proprietary usage and production-level SLA/SLO-backed support.
For more information, [reach out for a quote](https://min.io/pricing).

## Legacy Releases

MinIO has no planned or scheduled releases for this repository.
While a new release may be cut at any time, there is no timeline for when a subsequent release may occur.
All existing releases remain accessible through Github or at https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/ .

The following sections provide instructions for building against the `master` branch for deployments that require access to the latest changes:

- [Install from Source](#install-from-source)
- [Build Docker Image](#build-docker-image)

## Install from Source

Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source.
If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow [How to install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install). Minimum version required is [go1.24](https://golang.org/dl/#stable)

```sh
go install github.com/minio/minio@latest
```

You can alternatively run `go build` and use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to control the OS and architecture target.
For example:

```
env GOOS=linux GOARCh=arm64 go build
```

Start MinIO by running `minio server PATH` where `PATH` is any empty folder on your local filesystem.

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`.
You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.
Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials.
You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool:

```sh
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc admin info local
```

See [Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool.
For application developers, see &lt;https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/developers/minio-drivers.html&gt; to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Production environments using compiled-from-source MinIO binaries do so at their own risk.
&gt; The AGPLv3 license provides no warranties nor liabilites for any such usage.

## Build Docker Image

You can use the `docker build .` command to build a Docker image on your local host machine.
You must first [build MinIO](#install-from-source) and ensure the `minio` binary exists in the project root.

The following command builds the Docker image using the default `Dockerfile` in the root project directory with the repository and image tag `myminio:minio`

```sh
docker build -t myminio:minio .
```

Use `docker image ls` to confirm the image exists in your local repository.
You can run the server using standard Docker invocation:

```sh
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 myminio:minio server /tmp/minio --console-address :9001
```

Complete documentation for building Docker containers, managing custom images, or loading images into orchestration platforms is out of scope for this documentation.
You can modify the `Dockerfile` and `dockerscripts/socker-entrypoint.sh` as-needed to reflect your specific image requirements.

See the [MinIO Container](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/baremetal-deploy-minio-as-a-container.html#deploy-minio-container) documentation for more guidance on running MinIO within a Container image.

## Install using Helm Charts

There are two paths for installing MinIO onto Kubernetes infrastructure:

- Use the [MinIO Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator)
- Use the community-maintained [Helm charts](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/helm/minio)

See the [MinIO Documentation](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/kubernetes.html) for guidance on deploying using the Operator.
The Community Helm chart has instructions in the folder-level README.

## Test MinIO Connectivity

### Test using MinIO Console

MinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser.
Point your web browser to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; to ensure your server has started successfully.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use `--console-address` to pick a specific interface and port.

### Test using MinIO Client `mc`

`mc` provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services.

The following commands set a local alias, validate the server information, create a bucket, copy data to that bucket, and list the contents of the bucket.

```sh
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc admin info

  &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

## Project-HAMi: Heterogeneous AI Computing Virtualization Middleware

## Introduction

HAMi, formerly known as &#039;k8s-vGPU-scheduler&#039;, is a Heterogeneous device management middleware for Kubernetes. It can manage different types of heterogeneous devices (like GPU, NPU, etc.), share heterogeneous devices among pods, make better scheduling decisions based on topology of devices and scheduling policies.

It aims to remove the gap between different Heterogeneous devices, and provide a unified interface for users to manage with no changes to their applications. As of December 2024, HAMi has been widely used not only in Internet, public cloud and private cloud, but also broadly adopted in various vertical industries including finance, securities, energy, telecommunications, education, and manufacturing. More than 50 companies or institutions are not only end users but also active contributors. 

![cncf_logo](imgs/cncf-logo.png)

HAMi is a sandbox and [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?item=orchestration-management--scheduling-orchestration--hami) project of  
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/)(CNCF),

HAMi provides device virtualization for several heterogeneous devices including GPU, by supporting device sharing and device resource isolation. For the list of devices supporting device virtualization, see [supported devices](#supported-devices)

### Device sharing

- Allows partial device allocation by specifying device core usage.
- Allows partial device allocation by specifying device memory.
- Imposes a hard limit on streaming multiprocessors.
- Requires zero changes to existing programs.
- Support [dynamic-mig](docs/dynamic-mig-support.md) feature, [example](examples/nvidia/dynamic_mig_example.yaml)

&lt;img src=&quot;./imgs/example.png&quot; width = &quot;500&quot; /&gt; 

### Device Resources Isolation

A simple demonstration of device isolation:
A task with the following resources will see 3000M device memory inside container:

```yaml
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # declare how many physical GPUs the pod needs
          nvidia.com/gpumem: 3000 # identifies 3G GPU memory each physical GPU allocates to the pod
```

![img](./imgs/hard_limit.jpg)

&gt; Note:
1. **After installing HAMi, the value of `nvidia.com/gpu` registered on the node defaults to the number of vGPUs.**
2. **When requesting resources in a pod, `nvidia.com/gpu` refers to the number of physical GPUs required by the current pod.**

### Supported devices

[NVIDIA GPU](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi#preparing-your-gpu-nodes)   
[Cambricon MLU](docs/cambricon-mlu-support.md)   
[HYGON DCU](docs/hygon-dcu-support.md)   
[Iluvatar CoreX GPU](docs/iluvatar-gpu-support.md)

[HUAWEI Ascend NPU](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/ascend-device-plugin/blob/main/README.md)   
[MetaX GPU](docs/metax-support.md)   

## Architect

&lt;img src=&quot;./imgs/hami-arch.png&quot; width = &quot;600&quot; /&gt; 

HAMi consists of several components, including a unified mutatingwebhook, a unified scheduler extender, different device-plugins and different in-container virtualization technics for each heterogeneous AI devices.

## Quick Start

### Choose your orchestrator

[![kube-scheduler](https://img.shields.io/badge/kube-scheduler-blue)](#prerequisites)
[![volcano-scheduler](https://img.shields.io/badge/volcano-scheduler-orange)](docs/how-to-use-volcano-vgpu.md)

### Prerequisites

The list of prerequisites for running the NVIDIA device plugin is described below:

- NVIDIA drivers &gt;= 440
- nvidia-docker version &gt; 2.0
- default runtime configured as nvidia for containerd/docker/cri-o container runtime
- Kubernetes version &gt;= 1.18
- glibc &gt;= 2.17 &amp; glibc &lt; 2.30
- kernel version &gt;= 3.10
- helm &gt; 3.0

### Install

First, Label your GPU nodes for scheduling with HAMi by adding the label &quot;gpu=on&quot;. Without this label, the nodes cannot be managed by our scheduler.

```
kubectl label nodes {nodeid} gpu=on
```

Add our repo in helm

```
helm repo add hami-charts https://project-hami.github.io/HAMi/
```

Use the following command for deployment:

```
helm install hami hami-charts/hami -n kube-system
```

Customize your installation by adjusting the [configs](docs/config.md).

Verify your installation using the following command:

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

If both `hami-device-plugin` (formerly known as `vgpu-device-plugin`)  and `hami-scheduler` (formerly known as `vgpu-scheduler`)  pods are in the *Running* state, your installation is successful. You can try examples [here](examples/nvidia/default_use.yaml) 

### WebUI

[HAMi-WebUI](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi-WebUI) is available after HAMi v2.4

For installation guide, click [here](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi-WebUI/blob/main/docs/installation/helm/index.md)

### Monitor

Monitoring is automatically enabled after installation. Obtain an overview of cluster information by visiting the following URL:

```
http://{scheduler ip}:{monitorPort}/metrics
```

The default monitorPort is 31993; other values can be set using `--set devicePlugin.service.httpPort` during installation.

Grafana dashboard [example](docs/dashboard.md)

&gt; **Note** The status of a node won&#039;t be collected before you submit a task

## Notes

- If you don&#039;t request vGPUs when using the device plugin with NVIDIA images all the GPUs on the machine may be exposed inside your container
- Currently, A100 MIG can be supported in only &quot;none&quot; and &quot;mixed&quot; modes.
- Tasks with the &quot;nodeName&quot; field cannot be scheduled at the moment; please use &quot;nodeSelector&quot; instead.

## Contributing

### What

* Please [create](https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu/issues/new/choose) an issue if you find a bug or want to propose a change.
* Feature requests - always welcome!
* Bug fixes - always welcome!
* PRs - let&#039;s [discuss](https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu/discussions) first or [create](https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu/issues/new/choose) an issue.
* pdfcpu is stable but still *Alpha* and occasionally undergoing heavy changes.

### How

* The pdfcpu [discussion board](https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu/discussions) is open! Please engage in any form helpful for the community.
* If you want to report a bug please attach the *very verbose* (`pdfcpu cmd -vv ...`) output and ideally a test PDF that you can share.
* Always make sure your contribution is based on the latest commit.
* Please sign your commits.

### Reporting Crashes

Unfortunately crashes do happen :(
For the majority of the cases this is due to a diverse pool of PDF Writers out there and millions of PDF files using different versions waiting to be processed by pdfcpu. Sometimes these PDFs were written more than 20(!) years ago. Often there is an issue with validation - sometimes a bug in the parser. Many times even using relaxed validation with pdfcpu does not work. In these cases we need to extend relaxed validation and for this we are relying on your help. By reporting crashes you are helping to improve the stability of pdfcpu. If you happen to crash on any pdfcpu operation be it on the command line or in your Go backend these are the steps to report this:

Regardless of the pdfcpu operation, please start using the pdfcpu command line to validate your file:

``` sh
$ pdfcpu validate -v &amp;&gt; crash.log
```

 or to produce very verbose output

 ``` sh
 $ pdfcpu validate -vv &amp;&gt; crash.log
 ```

will produce what&#039;s needed to investigate a crash. Then open an issue and post `crash.log` or its contents. Ideally post a test PDF you can share to reproduce this. You can also email to hhrutter@gmail.com or if you prefer Slack you can get in touch on the Gopher slack #pdfcpu channel.

If processing your PDF with pdfcpu crashes during validation and can be opened by Adobe Reader and Mac Preview chances are we can extend relaxed validation and provide a fix. If the file in question cannot be opened by both Adobe Reader and Mac Preview we cannot help you!

# MCP Go SDK

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

This repository contains an implementation of the official Go software
development kit (SDK) for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Package / Feature documentation

The SDK consists of several importable packages:

- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp)
  package defines the primary APIs for constructing and using MCP clients and
  servers.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc) package is for users implementing
  their own transports.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth)
  package provides some primitives for supporting OAuth.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex)
  package provides extensions to the OAuth protocol, such as ProtectedResourceMetadata.

The SDK endeavors to implement the full MCP spec. The [`docs/`](/docs/) directory
contains feature documentation, mapping the MCP spec to the packages above.

## Getting started

To get started creating an MCP server, create an `mcp.Server` instance, add
features to it, and then run it over an `mcp.Transport`. For example, this
server adds a single simple tool, and then connects it to clients over
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

type Input struct {
	Name string `json:&quot;name&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the name of the person to greet&quot;`
}

type Output struct {
	Greeting string `json:&quot;greeting&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the greeting to tell to the user&quot;`
}

func SayHi(ctx context.Context, req *mcp.CallToolRequest, input Input) (
	*mcp.CallToolResult,
	Output,
	error,
) {
	return nil, Output{Greeting: &quot;Hi &quot; + input.Name}, nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a server with a single tool.
	server := mcp.NewServer(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;greeter&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)
	mcp.AddTool(server, &amp;mcp.Tool{Name: &quot;greet&quot;, Description: &quot;say hi&quot;}, SayHi)
	// Run the server over stdin/stdout, until the client disconnects.
	if err := server.Run(context.Background(), &amp;mcp.StdioTransport{}); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

To communicate with that server, create an `mcp.Client` and connect it to the
corresponding server, by running the server command and communicating over its
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;os/exec&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Create a new client, with no features.
	client := mcp.NewClient(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;mcp-client&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)

	// Connect to a server over stdin/stdout.
	transport := &amp;mcp.CommandTransport{Command: exec.Command(&quot;myserver&quot;)}
	session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	// Call a tool on the server.
	params := &amp;mcp.CallToolParams{
		Name:      &quot;greet&quot;,
		Arguments: map[string]any{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;you&quot;},
	}
	res, err := session.CallTool(ctx, params)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;CallTool failed: %v&quot;, err)
	}
	if res.IsError {
		log.Fatal(&quot;tool failed&quot;)
	}
	for _, c := range res.Content {
		log.Print(c.(*mcp.TextContent).Text)
	}
}
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># mkcert

mkcert is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It requires no configuration.

```
$ mkcert -install
Created a new local CA 💥
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ⚡️
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser restart)! 🦊

$ mkcert example.com &quot;*.example.com&quot; example.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - &quot;example.com&quot;
 - &quot;*.example.com&quot;
 - &quot;example.test&quot;
 - &quot;localhost&quot;
 - &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
 - &quot;::1&quot;

The certificate is at &quot;./example.com+5.pem&quot; and the key at &quot;./example.com+5-key.pem&quot; ✅
```

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;498&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome and Firefox screenshot&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1225294/51066373-96d4aa80-15be-11e9-91e2-f4e44a3a4458.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using certificates from real certificate authorities (CAs) for development can be dangerous or impossible (for hosts like `example.test`, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`), but self-signed certificates cause trust errors. Managing your own CA is the best solution, but usually involves arcane commands, specialized knowledge and manual steps.

mkcert automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates. mkcert does not automatically configure servers to use the certificates, though, that&#039;s up to you.

## Installation

&gt; **Warning**: the `rootCA-key.pem` file that mkcert automatically generates gives complete power to intercept secure requests from your machine. Do not share it.

### macOS

On macOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox
```

or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).

```
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install mkcert
sudo port install nss # if you use Firefox
```

### Linux

On Linux, first install `certutil`.

```
sudo apt install libnss3-tools
    -or-
sudo yum install nss-tools
    -or-
sudo pacman -S nss
    -or-
sudo zypper install mozilla-nss-tools
```

Then you can install using [Homebrew on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)

```
brew install mkcert
```

or build from source (requires Go 1.13+)

```
git clone https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert &amp;&amp; cd mkcert
go build -ldflags &quot;-X main.Version=$(git describe --tags)&quot;
```

or use [the pre-built binaries](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases).

```
curl -JLO &quot;https://dl.filippo.io/mkcert/latest?for=linux/amd64&quot;
chmod +x mkcert-v*-linux-amd64
sudo cp mkcert-v*-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert
```

For Arch Linux users, [`mkcert`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mkcert/) is available on the official Arch Linux repository.

```
sudo pacman -Syu mkcert
```

### Windows

On Windows, use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)

```
choco install mkcert
```

or use Scoop

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install mkcert
```

or build from source (requires Go 1.10+), or use [the pre-built binaries](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases).

If you&#039;re running into permission problems try running `mkcert` as an Administrator.

## Supported root stores

mkcert supports the following root stores:

* macOS system store
* Windows system store
* Linux variants that provide either
    * `update-ca-trust` (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS) or
    * `update-ca-certificates` (Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, SLES) or
    * `trust` (Arch)
* Firefox (macOS and Linux only)
* Chrome and Chromium
* Java (when `JAVA_HOME` is set)

To only install the local root CA into a subset of them, you can set the `TRUST_STORES` environment variable to a comma-separated list. Options are: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;java&quot; and &quot;nss&quot; (includes Firefox).

## Advanced topics

### Advanced options

```
	-cert-file FILE, -key-file FILE, -p12-file FILE
	    Customize the output paths.

	-client
	    Generate a certificate for client authentication.

	-ecdsa
	    Generate a certificate with an ECDSA key.

	-pkcs12
	    Generate a &quot;.p12&quot; PKCS #12 file, also know as a &quot;.pfx&quot; file,
	    containing certificate and key for legacy applications.

	-csr CSR
	    Generate a certificate based on the supplied CSR. Conflicts with
	    all other flags and arguments except -install and -cert-file.
```

&gt; **Note:** You _must_ place these options before the domain names list.

#### Example

```
mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem example.com *.example.com
```

### S/MIME

mkcert automatically generates an S/MIME certificate if one of the supplied names is an email address.

```
mkcert filippo@example.com
```

### Mobile devices

For the certificates to be trusted on mobile devices, you will have to install the root CA. It&#039;s the `rootCA.pem` file in the folder printed by `mkcert -CAROOT`.

On iOS, you can either use AirDrop, email the CA to yourself, or serve it from an HTTP server. After opening it, you need to [install the profile in Settings &gt; Profile Downloaded](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/issues/233#issuecomment-690110809) and then [enable full trust in it](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT204477).

For Android, you will have to install the CA and then enable user roots in the development build of your app. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22040887/749014).

### Using the root with Node.js

Node does not use the system root store, so it won&#039;t accept mkcert certificates automatically. Instead, you will have to set the [`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file) environment variable.

```
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=&quot;$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem&quot;
```

### Changing the location of the CA files

The CA certificate and its key are stored in an application data folder in the user home. You usually don&#039;t have to worry about it, as installation is automated, but the location is printed by `mkcert -CAROOT`.

If you want to manage separate CAs, you can use the environment variable `$CAROOT` to set the folder where mkcert will place and look for the local CA files.

### Installing the CA on other systems

Installing in the trust store does not require the CA key, so you can export the CA certificate and use mkcert to install it in other machines.

* Look for the `rootCA.pem` file in `mkcert -CAROOT`
* copy it to a different machine
* set `$CAROOT` to its directory
* run `mkcert -install`

Remember that mkcert is meant for development purposes, not production, so it should not be used on end users&#039; machines, and that you should *not* export or share `rootCA-key.pem`.

## 👋 INTRODUCTION

SafeLine is a self-hosted **`WAF(Web Application Firewall)`** to protect your web apps from attacks and exploits.

A web application firewall helps protect web apps by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It typically protects web apps from attacks such as `SQL injection`, `XSS`, `code injection`, `os command injection`, `CRLF injection`, `ldap injection`, `xpath injection`, `RCE`, `XXE`, `SSRF`, `path traversal`, `backdoor`, `bruteforce`, `http-flood`, `bot abused`, among others.

#### 💡 How It Works

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/how-it-works.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;

By deploying a WAF in front of a web application, a shield is placed between the web application and the Internet. While a proxy server protects a client machine’s identity by using an intermediary, a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy, protecting the server from exposure by having clients pass through the WAF before reaching the server.

A WAF protects your web apps by filtering, monitoring, and blocking any malicious HTTP/S traffic traveling to the web application, and prevents any unauthorized data from leaving the app. It does this by adhering to a set of policies that help determine what traffic is malicious and what traffic is safe. Just as a proxy server acts as an intermediary to protect the identity of a client, a WAF operates in similar fashion but acting as a reverse proxy intermediary that protects the web app server from a potentially malicious client.

its core capabilities include:

- Defenses for web attacks
- Proactive bot abused defense 
- HTML &amp; JS code encryption
- IP-based rate limiting
- Web Access Control List

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

- Find and use [popular software packaged as Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) to run in Kubernetes
- Share your own applications as Helm Charts
- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
- Manage releases of Helm packages

## Helm in a Handbasket

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Helm Development and Stable Versions

Helm v4 is currently under development on the `main` branch. This is unstable and the APIs within the Go SDK and at the command line are changing.
Helm v3 (current stable) is maintained on the `dev-v3` branch. APIs there follow semantic versioning.

## Install

Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest).

Unpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!

If you want to use a package manager:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install helm`.
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) users can use `choco install kubernetes-helm`.
- [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) users can use `winget install Helm.Helm`.
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) users can use `scoop install helm`.
- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) users can use `snap install helm --classic`.
- [Flox](https://flox.dev) users can use `flox install kubernetes-helm`.

To rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the [Quick Start Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/).

See the [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more options,
including installing pre-releases.

## Docs

Get started with the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://helm.sh/docs).

## Roadmap

The [Helm roadmap uses GitHub milestones](https://github.com/helm/helm/milestones) to track the progress of the project.

The development of Helm v4 is currently happening on the `main` branch while the development of Helm v3, the stable branch, is happening on the `dev-v3` branch. Changes should be made to the `main` branch prior to being added to the `dev-v3` branch so that all changes are carried along to Helm v4.

## Community, discussion, contribution, and support

You can reach the Helm community and developers via the following channels:

- [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):
  - [#helm-users](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/helm-users)
  - [#helm-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/helm-dev)
  - [#charts](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/charts)
- Mailing List:
  - [Helm Mailing List](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-helm)
- Developer Call: Thursdays at 9:30-10:00 Pacific ([meeting details](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/communication.md#meetings))

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.

Harbor is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of cloud native technologies, consider joining the CNCF. For details about whose involved and how Harbor plays a role, read the CNCF
[announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/).

## Features

* **Cloud native registry**: With support for both container images and [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts, Harbor serves as registry for cloud native environments like container runtimes and orchestration platforms.
* **Role based access control**: Users access different repositories through &#039;projects&#039; and a user can have different permission for images or Helm charts under a project.
* **Policy based replication**: Images and charts can be replicated (synchronized) between multiple registry instances based on policies with using filters (repository, tag and label). Harbor automatically retries a replication if it encounters any errors. This can be used to assist loadbalancing, achieve high availability, and facilitate multi-datacenter deployments in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Harbor scans images regularly for vulnerabilities and has policy checks to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed.
* **LDAP/AD support**: Harbor integrates with existing enterprise LDAP/AD for user authentication and management, and supports importing LDAP groups into Harbor that can then be given permissions to specific projects.
* **OIDC support**: Harbor leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) to verify the identity of users authenticated by an external authorization server or identity provider. Single sign-on can be enabled to log into the Harbor portal.
* **Image deletion &amp; garbage collection**: System admin can run garbage collection jobs so that images(dangling manifests and unreferenced blobs) can be deleted and their space can be freed up periodically.
* **Notary**: Support signing container images using Docker Content Trust (leveraging Notary) for guaranteeing authenticity and provenance.  In addition, policies that prevent unsigned images from being deployed can also be activated.
* **Graphical user portal**: User can easily browse, search repositories and manage projects.
* **Auditing**: All the operations to the repositories are tracked through logs.
* **RESTful API**: RESTful APIs are provided to facilitate administrative operations, and are easy to use for integration with external systems. An embedded Swagger UI is available for exploring and testing the API.
* **Easy deployment**: Harbor can be deployed via Docker compose as well Helm Chart, and a Harbor Operator was added recently as well.

**Weaviate** is an open-source, cloud-native vector database that stores both objects and vectors, enabling semantic search at scale. It combines vector similarity search with keyword filtering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reranking in a single query interface. Common use cases include RAG systems, semantic and image search, recommendation engines, chatbots, and content classification.

Weaviate supports two approaches to store vectors: automatic vectorization at import using [integrated models](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and others) or direct import of [pre-computed vector embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors). Production deployments benefit from built-in multi-tenancy, replication, RBAC authorization, and [many other features](#weaviate-features).

To get started quickly, have a look at one of these tutorials:

- [Quickstart - Weaviate Cloud](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart)
- [Quickstart - local Docker instance](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart/local)

## Installation

Weaviate offers multiple installation and deployment options:

- [Docker](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/docker-installation)
- [Kubernetes](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/k8s-installation)
- [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud)

See the [installation docs](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy) for more deployment options, such as [AWS](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/aws-marketplace) and [GCP](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/gcp-marketplace).

## Getting started

You can easily start Weaviate and a local vector embedding model with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
services:
  weaviate:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:1.32.2
    ports:
      - &quot;8080:8080&quot;
      - &quot;50051:50051&quot;
    environment:
      ENABLE_MODULES: text2vec-model2vec
      MODEL2VEC_INFERENCE_API: http://text2vec-model2vec:8080

  # A lightweight embedding model that will generate vectors from objects during import
  text2vec-model2vec:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/model2vec-inference:minishlab-potion-base-32M
```

Start Weaviate and the embedding service with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Install the Python client (or use another [client library](#client-libraries-and-apis)):

```bash
pip install -U weaviate-client
```

The following Python example shows how easy it is to populate a Weaviate database with data, create vector embeddings and perform semantic search:

```python
import weaviate
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, DataType, Property

# Connect to Weaviate
client = weaviate.connect_to_local()

# Create a collection
client.collections.create(
    name=&quot;Article&quot;,
    properties=[Property(name=&quot;content&quot;, data_type=DataType.TEXT)],
    vector_config=Configure.Vectors.text2vec_model2vec(),  # Use a vectorizer to generate embeddings during import
    # vector_config=Configure.Vectors.self_provided()  # If you want to import your own pre-generated embeddings
)

# Insert objects and generate embeddings
articles = client.collections.get(&quot;Article&quot;)
articles.data.insert_many(
    [
        {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Vector databases enable semantic search&quot;},
        {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Machine learning models generate embeddings&quot;},
        {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Weaviate supports hybrid search capabilities&quot;},
    ]
)

# Perform semantic search
results = articles.query.near_text(query=&quot;Search objects by meaning&quot;, limit=1)
print(results.objects[0])

client.close()
```

This example uses the `Model2Vec` vectorizer, but you can choose any other [embedding model provider](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) or [bring your own pre-generated vectors](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors).

## Client libraries and APIs

Weaviate provides client libraries for several programming languages:

- [Python](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/python)
- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript)
- [Java](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/java)
- [Go](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/go)
- C# (🚧 Coming soon 🚧)

There are also additional [community-maintained libraries](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/community).

Weaviate exposes [REST API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/rest), [gRPC API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/grpc), and [GraphQL API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/graphql) to communicate with the database server.

## Weaviate features

These features enable you to build AI-powered applications:

- **⚡ Fast Search Performance**: Perform complex semantic [searches](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/similarity) over billions of vectors in milliseconds. Weaviate&#039;s architecture is built in Go for speed and reliability, ensuring your AI applications are highly responsive even under heavy load. See our [ANN benchmarks](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/benchmarks/ann) for more info.

- **🔌 Flexible Vectorization**: Seamlessly vectorize data at import time with [integrated vectorizers](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) from OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, Google, and more. Or you can import [your own vector embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors).

- **🔍 Advanced Hybrid &amp; Image Search**: Combine the power of semantic search with traditional [keyword (BM25) search](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/bm25), [image search](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/image) and [advanced filtering](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/filters) to get the best results with a single API call.

- **🤖 Integrated RAG &amp; Reranking**: Go beyond simple retrieval with built-in [generative search (RAG)](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/generative) and [reranking](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/rerank) capabilities. Power sophisticated Q&amp;A systems, chatbots, and summarizers directly from your database without additional tooling.

- **📈 Production-Ready &amp; Scalable**: Weaviate is built for mission-critical applications. Go from rapid prototyping to production at scale with native support for [horizontal scaling](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/horizontal-scaling), [multi-tenancy](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/manage-collections/multi-tenancy), [replication](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/replication), and fine-grained [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/rbac).

- **💰 Cost-Efficient Operations**: Radically lower resource consumption and operational costs with built-in [vector compression](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/compression). Vector quantization and multi-vector encoding reduce memory usage with minimal impact on search performance.

For a complete list of all functionalities, visit the [official Weaviate documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io).

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

## Get Started

### **1. Nuclei CLI**

_Install Nuclei on your machine. Get started by following the installation guide [**`here`**](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/install?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=nuclei_readme). Additionally, We provide [**`a free cloud tier`**](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/sign-up) and comes with a generous monthly free limits:_

- Store and visualize your vulnerability findings
- Write and manage your nuclei templates
- Access latest nuclei templates
- Discover and store your targets

&gt; [!Important]
&gt; |**This project is in active development**. Expect breaking changes with releases. Review the release changelog before updating.|
&gt; |:--------------------------------|
&gt; | This project is primarily built to be used as a standalone CLI tool. **Running nuclei as a service may pose security risks.** It&#039;s recommended to use with caution and additional security measures. |
