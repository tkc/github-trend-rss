&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Installation

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose using provided directory structure (recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a new directory called `glance` as well as the template files within it by running:

```bash
mkdir glance &amp;&amp; cd glance &amp;&amp; curl -sL https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xzf - --strip-components 2
```

*[click here to view the files that will be created](https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/tree/main/root)*

Then, edit the following files as desired:
* `docker-compose.yml` to configure the port, volumes and other containery things
* `config/home.yml` to configure the widgets or layout of the home page
* `config/glance.yml` if you want to change the theme or add more pages

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Other files you may want to edit&lt;/summary&gt;

* `.env` to configure environment variables that will be available inside configuration files
* `assets/user.css` to add custom CSS
&lt;/details&gt;

When ready, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose manual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  glance:
    container_name: glance
    image: glanceapp/glance
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Then, create a new directory called `config` and download the example starting [`glance.yml`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/glance.yml) file into it by running:

```bash
mkdir config &amp;&amp; wget -O config/glance.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

Feel free to edit the `glance.yml` file to your liking, and when ready run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker logs glance
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual binary installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Precompiled binaries are available for Linux, Windows and macOS (x86, x86_64, ARM and ARM64 architectures).

### Linux

Visit the [latest release page](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) for available binaries. You can place the binary in `/opt/glance/` and have it start with your server via a [systemd service](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/). By default, when running the binary, it will look for a `glance.yml` file in the directory it&#039;s placed in. To specify a different path for the config file, use the `--config` option:

```bash
/opt/glance/glance --config /etc/glance.yml
```

To grab a starting template for the config file, run:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

### Windows

Download and extract the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) (most likely the file called `glance-windows-amd64.zip` if you&#039;re on a 64-bit system) and place it in a folder of your choice. Then, create a new text file called `glance.yml` in the same folder and paste the content from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml) in it. You should then be able to run the executable and access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.



&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Glance can also be installed through the following 3rd party channels:
* [Proxmox VE Helper Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=glance)
* [NixOS package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&amp;show=glance)
* [Coolify.io](https://coolify.io/docs/services/glance/)

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Building from source

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build binary with Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) &gt;= v1.23

To build the project for your current OS and architecture, run:

```bash
go build -o build/glance .
```

To build for a specific OS and architecture, run:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/glance .
```

[*click here for a full list of GOOS and GOARCH combinations*](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#:~:text=$GOOS%20and%20$GOARCH)

Alternatively, if you just want to run the app without creating a binary, like when you&#039;re testing out changes, you can run:

```bash
go run .
```
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build project and Docker image with Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To build the project and image using just Docker, run:

*(replace `owner` with your name or organization)*

```bash
docker build -t owner/glance:latest .
```

If you wish to push the image to a registry (by default Docker Hub), run:

```bash
docker push owner/glance:latest
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## FAQ
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the information on the page update automatically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No, a page refresh is required to update the information. Some things do dynamically update where it makes sense, like the clock widget and the relative time showing how long ago something happened.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequently do widgets update?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No requests are made periodically in the background, information is only fetched upon loading the page and then cached. The default cache lifetime is different for each widget and can be configured.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I create my own widgets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, there are multiple ways to create custom widgets:
* `iframe` widget - allows you to embed things from other websites
* `html` widget - allows you to insert your own static HTML
* `extension` widget - fetch HTML from a URL
* `custom-api` widget - fetch JSON from a URL and render it using custom HTML
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I change the title of a widget?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, the title of all widgets can be changed by specifying the `title` property in the widget&#039;s configuration:

```yaml
- type: rss
  title: My custom title

- type: markets
  title: My custom title

- type: videos
  title: My custom title

# and so on for all widgets...
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Feature requests

New feature suggestions are always welcome and will be considered, though please keep in mind that some of them may be out of scope for what the project is trying to achieve (or is reasonably capable of). If you have an idea for a new feature and would like to share it, you can do so [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

Feature requests are tagged with one of the following:

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/roadmap) - will be implemented in a future release
* [Backlog](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/backlog) - may be implemented in the future but needs further feedback or interest from the community
* [Icebox](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/icebox) - no plans to implement as it doesn&#039;t currently align with the project&#039;s goals or capabilities, may be revised at a later date

&lt;br&gt;

## Contributing guidelines

* Before working on a new feature it&#039;s preferable to submit a feature request first and state that you&#039;d like to implement it yourself
* Please don&#039;t submit PRs for feature requests that are either in the roadmap&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;, backlog&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; or icebox&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Use `dev` for the base branch if you&#039;re adding new features or fixing bugs, otherwise use `main`
* Avoid introducing new dependencies
* Avoid making backwards-incompatible configuration changes
* Avoid introducing new colors or hard-coding colors, use the standard `primary`, `positive` and `negative`
* For icons, try to use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) where applicable
* Provide a screenshot of the changes if UI related where possible
* No `package.json`

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1] [2] [3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

[1] The feature likely already has work put into it that may conflict with your implementation

[2] The demand, implementation or functionality for this feature is not yet clear

[3] No plans to add this feature for the time being

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

### What is DiceDB?

DiceDB is an open-source, fast, reactive, in-memory database optimized for modern hardware. Commonly used as a cache, it offers a familiar interface while enabling real-time data updates through query subscriptions. It delivers higher throughput and lower median latencies, making it ideal for modern workloads.

## Get started

### Setting up DiceDB with Docker

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```bash
$ docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb:latest
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and SDKs.

### Build from source

To build DiceDB from source, you need to have the following

1. [Golang](https://go.dev/)
2. Any of the below supported platform environments:
    1. [Linux based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)
    2. [OSX (Darwin) based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)
    3. WSL under Windows

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dicedb/dice
$ cd dice
$ make build
```

The above command will create a binary `dicedb`. Execute the binary and that will
start the DiceDB server., or, you can run the following command to run like a usual
Go program

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

You can skip passing the flag if you are not working with `.WATCH` feature.

## Setting up CLI

### Using cURL

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and you can install it by running the following command

```bash
$ sudo su
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you are working on unsupported OS (as per above script), you can always follow the installation instructions mentioned in the [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) repository.

### Building from source

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli
$ cd dicedb-cli
$ make build
```

The above command will create a binary `dicedb-cli`. Execute the binary will
start the CLI and will try to connect to the DiceDB server.

## Want to contribute?

We have multiple repositories where you can contribute. So, as per your interest, you can pick one and build a deeper understanding of the project on the go.

- [dicedb/dice](https://github.com/dicedb/dice) for core database features and engine / Stack - Go
- [dicedb/dicedb-cli](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-cli) command line interface for DiceDB / Stack - Go
- [dicedb/dicedb-go](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-go) Go Client for DiceDB

## Essentials for Development

### Pointing to local checked-out `dicedb-go`

It is advised to checkout [dicedb-go](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-go) repository also because `dice` takes
a strong dependency on it. To point to the local copy add the following line
at the end of the `go.mod` file.

```
replace github.com/dicedb/dicedb-go =&gt; ../dicedb-go
```

Note: this is the literal line that needs to be added at the end of the go.mod file.
Refer to [this article](https://thewebivore.com/using-replace-in-go-mod-to-point-to-your-local-module/), to understand what it is and why it is needed.

Do not check-in the `go.mod` file with this change.

### Install GoLangCI

```bash
$ sudo su
$ sudo curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- -b /bin v1.64.6
```

### Local Setup with Custom Config

Follow these steps to generate and customize your dicedb configuration in a local setup:

```bash
$ go run main.go config-init
```

This will generate configuration file (`dicedb.yaml`) in metadata directory.
Metadata directory is OS-specific,

 - macOS: `/usr/local/etc/dicedb/dicedb.yaml`
 - Linux: `/etc/dicedb/dicedb.yaml`

If you run with a `sudo` privileges, then these directories are used, otherwise
the current working directory is used as the metada directory.

### Running Tests

Unit tests and integration tests are essential for ensuring correctness and in the case of DiceDB, both types of tests are available to validate its functionality.

For unit testing, you can execute individual unit tests by specifying the name of the test function using the `TEST_FUNC` environment variable and running the `make unittest-one` command. Alternatively, running `make unittest` will execute all unit tests.

### Executing one unit test

```bash
TEST_FUNC=&lt;name of the test function&gt; make unittest-one
TEST_FUNC=TestByteList make unittest-one
```

### Running all unit tests

```bash
make unittest
```

Integration tests, on the other hand, involve starting up the DiceDB server and running a series of commands to verify the expected end state and output. To execute a single integration test, you can set the `TEST_FUNC` environment variable to the name of the test function and run `make test-one`. Running `make test` will execute all integration tests.

### Executing a single integration test

Make sure you have DiceDB running before you run the following commands.
By default it connects to the local instance of DiceDB running on port `7379`.

```bash
TEST_FUNC=&lt;name of the test function&gt; make test-one
TEST_FUNC=^TestSet$ make test-one
```

### Running all integration tests

```bash
$ make test
```

Use OSV-Scanner to find existing vulnerabilities affecting your project&#039;s dependencies.
OSV-Scanner provides an officially supported frontend to the [OSV database](https://osv.dev/) and CLI interface to [OSV-Scalibr](https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr) that connects a project’s list of dependencies with the vulnerabilities that affect them.

OSV-Scanner supports a wide range of project types, package managers and features, including but not limited to:

- **Languages:** C/C++, Dart, Elixir, Go, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Rust.
- **Package Managers:** npm, pip, yarn, maven, go modules, cargo, gem, composer, nuget and others.
- **Operating Systems:** Detects vulnerabilities in OS packages on Linux systems.
- **Containers:** Scans container images for vulnerabilities in their base images and included packages.
- **Guided Remediation:** Provides recommendations for package version upgrades based on criteria such as dependency depth, minimum severity, fix strategy, and return on investment.

OSV-Scanner uses the extensible [OSV-Scalibr](https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr) library under the hood to provide this functionality. If a language or package manager is not supported currently, please file a [feature request.](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/issues)

#### Underlying database

The underlying database, [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) has several benefits in comparison with closed source advisory databases and scanners:

- Covering most open source language and OS ecosystems (including [Git](https://osv.dev/list?q=&amp;ecosystem=GIT)), it’s comprehensive.
- Each advisory comes from an open and authoritative source (e.g. [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/github/advisory-database), [RustSec Advisory Database](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db), [Ubuntu security notices](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/tree/main/osv))
- Anyone can suggest improvements to advisories, resulting in a very high quality database.
- The OSV format unambiguously stores information about affected versions in a machine-readable format that precisely maps onto a developer’s list of packages

The above all results in accurate and actionable vulnerability notifications, which reduces the time needed to resolve them. Check out [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) for more details!

## Basic installation

To install OSV-Scanner, please refer to the [installation section](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/installation) of our documentation. OSV-Scanner releases can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/releases) of the GitHub repository. The recommended method is to download a prebuilt binary for your platform. Alternatively, you can use
`go install github.com/google/osv-scanner/v2/cmd/osv-scanner@latest` to build it from source.

## Key Features

For more information, please read our [detailed documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner) to learn how to use OSV-Scanner. For detailed information about each feature, click their titles in this README.

Please note: These are the instructions for the latest OSV-Scanner V2 beta. If you are using V1, checkout the V1 [README](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner-v1) and [documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner-v1/) instead.

### [Scanning a source directory](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage)

```bash
$ osv-scanner scan source -r /path/to/your/dir
```

This command will recursively scan the specified directory for any supported package files, such as `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, etc. and output any discovered vulnerabilities.

OSV-Scanner has the option of using call analysis to determine if a vulnerable function is actually being used in the project, resulting in fewer false positives, and actionable alerts.

OSV-Scanner can also detect vendored C/C++ code for vulnerability scanning. See [here](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/#cc-scanning) for details.

#### Supported Lockfiles

OSV-Scanner supports 11+ language ecosystems and 19+ lockfile types. To check if your ecosystem is covered, please check out our [detailed documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/supported-languages-and-lockfiles/#supported-lockfiles).

### [Container Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/scan-image)

OSV-Scanner also supports comprehensive, layer-aware scanning for container images to detect vulnerabilities the following operating system packages and language-specific dependencies.

| Distro Support | Language Artifacts Support |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Alpine OS      | Go                         |
| Debian         | Java                       |
| Ubuntu         | Node                       |
|                | Python                     |

See the [full documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/supported-languages-and-lockfiles/#supported-artifacts) for details on support.

**Usage**:

```bash
$ osv-scanner scan image my-image-name:tag
```

![screencast of html output of container scanning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bb95366-27ec-45d1-86ed-e42890f2fb46)

### [License Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/license-scanning/)

Check your dependencies&#039; licenses using deps.dev data. For a summary:

```bash
osv-scanner --licenses path/to/repository
```

To check against an allowed license list (SPDX format):

```bash
osv-scanner --licenses=&quot;MIT,Apache-2.0&quot; path/to/directory
```

### [Offline Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/offline-mode/)

Scan your project against a local OSV database. No network connection is required after the initial database download. The database can also be manually downloaded.

```bash
osv-scanner --offline --download-offline-databases ./path/to/your/dir
```

### [Guided Remediation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/) (Experimental)

OSV-Scanner provides guided remediation, a feature that suggests package version upgrades based on criteria such as dependency depth, minimum severity, fix strategy, and return on investment.
We currently support remediating vulnerabilities in the following files:

| Ecosystem | File Format (Type)             | Supported Remediation Strategies                                                                                  |
| :-------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm       | `package-lock.json` (lockfile) | [`in-place`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#in-place-lockfile-remediation) |
| npm       | `package.json` (manifest)      | [`relock`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#in-place-lockfile-remediation)   |
| Maven     | `pom.xml` (manifest)           | [`override`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#override-dependency-versions)  |

This is available as a headless CLI command, as well as an interactive mode.

#### Example (for npm)

```bash
$ osv-scanner fix \
    --max-depth=3 \
    --min-severity=5 \
    --ignore-dev  \
    --strategy=in-place \
    -L path/to/package-lock.json
```

#### Interactive mode (for npm)

```bash
$ osv-scanner fix \
    -M path/to/package.json \
    -L path/to/package-lock.json
```

## K9s - Kubernetes CLI To Manage Your Clusters In Style!

K9s provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters.
The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage
your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes
for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.

---

## Note...

K9s is not pimped out by a big corporation with deep pockets.
It is a complex OSS project that demands a lot of my time to maintain and support.
K9s will always remain OSS and therefore free! That said, if you feel k9s makes your day to day Kubernetes journey a tad brighter, saves you time and makes you more productive, please consider [sponsoring us!](https://github.com/sponsors/derailed)
Your donations will go a long way in keeping our servers lights on and beers in our fridge!

**Thank you!**

## Building From Source

 K9s is currently using GO v1.23.X or above.
 In order to build K9s from source you must:

 1. Clone the repo
 2. Build and run the executable

      ```shell
      make build &amp;&amp; ./execs/k9s
      ```

---

## Running with Docker

### Running the official Docker image

  You can run k9s as a Docker container by mounting your `KUBECONFIG`:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v $KUBECONFIG:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s
  ```

  For default path it would be:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s
  ```

### Building your own Docker image

  You can build your own Docker image of k9s from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with the following:

  ```shell
  docker build -t k9s-docker:v0.0.1 .
  ```

  You can get the latest stable `kubectl` version and pass it to the `docker build` command with the `--build-arg` option.
  You can use the `--build-arg` option to pass any valid `kubectl` version (like `v1.18.0` or `v1.19.1`).

  ```shell
  KUBECTL_VERSION=$(make kubectl-stable-version 2&gt;/dev/null)
  docker build --build-arg KUBECTL_VERSION=${KUBECTL_VERSION} -t k9s-docker:0.1 .
  ```

  Run your container:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config k9s-docker:0.1
  ```

---

## PreFlight Checks

* K9s uses 256 colors terminal mode. On `Nix system make sure TERM is set accordingly.

    ```shell
    export TERM=xterm-256color
    ```

* In order to issue resource edit commands make sure your EDITOR and KUBE_EDITOR env vars are set.

    ```shell
    # Kubectl edit command will use this env var.
    export KUBE_EDITOR=my_fav_editor
    ```

* K9s prefers recent kubernetes versions ie 1.28+

less /tmp/k9s.log
```

Or through the `K9S_LOGS_DIR` environment variable:

```shell
K9S_LOGS_DIR=/var/log k9s
less /var/log/k9s.log
```

## Key Bindings

K9s uses aliases to navigate most K8s resources.

## K9s Configuration

  K9s keeps its configurations as YAML files inside of a `k9s` directory and the location depends on your operating system. K9s leverages [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) to load its various configurations files. For information on the default locations for your OS please see [this link](https://github.com/adrg/xdg/blob/master/README.md). If you are still confused a quick `k9s info` will reveal where k9s is loading its configurations from. Alternatively, you can set `K9S_CONFIG_DIR` to tell K9s the directory location to pull its configurations from.

  | Unix            | macOS                              | Windows               |
  |-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
  | `~/.config/k9s` | `~/Library/Application Support/k9s` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\k9s`  |

  &gt; NOTE: This is still in flux and will change while in pre-release stage!

You can now override the context portForward default address configuration by setting an env variable that can override all clusters portForward local address using `K9S_DEFAULT_PF_ADDRESS=a.b.c.d`

    noIcons: false
    # Toggles whether k9s should check for the latest revision from the GitHub repository releases. Default is false.
    skipLatestRevCheck: false
    # When altering kubeconfig or using multiple kube configs, k9s will clean up clusters configurations that are no longer in use. Setting this flag to true will keep k9s from cleaning up inactive cluster configs. Defaults to false.
    keepMissingClusters: false
    # Logs configuration
    logger:
      # Defines the number of lines to return. Default 100
      tail: 200
      # Defines the total number of log lines to allow in the view. Default 1000
      buffer: 500
      # Represents how far to go back in the log timeline in seconds. Setting to -1 will tail logs. Default is -1.

## &lt;a id=&quot;popeye&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Popeye Configuration

K9s has integration with [Popeye](https://popeyecli.io/), which is a Kubernetes cluster sanitizer.  Popeye itself uses a configuration called `spinach.yml`, but when integrating with K9s the cluster-specific file should be name `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/share/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/spinach.yml`.  This allows you to have a different spinach config per cluster.

## Node Shell

By enabling the nodeShell feature gate on a given cluster, K9s allows you to shell into your cluster nodes. Once enabled, you will have a new `s` for `shell` menu option while in node view. K9s will launch a pod on the selected node using a special k9s_shell pod. Furthermore, you can refine your shell pod by using a cu

ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.

## Documentation

This README is a part of the complete documentation, available [here](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/).

## What It Does

Inspired by [Kubernetes DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns), Kubernetes&#039; cluster-internal DNS server, ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers.
Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/api/) to determine a desired list of DNS records.
*Unlike* KubeDNS, however, it&#039;s not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly—e.g. [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/).

In a broader sense, ExternalDNS allows you to control DNS records dynamically via Kubernetes resources in a DNS provider-agnostic way.

The [FAQ](docs/faq.md) contains additional information and addresses several questions about key concepts of ExternalDNS.

To see ExternalDNS in action, have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HQ2XgL9YVI) or read this [blogpost](https://codemine.be/posts/20190125-devops-eks-externaldns/).

## The Latest Release

- [current release process](./docs/release.md)

ExternalDNS allows you to keep selected zones (via `--domain-filter`) synchronized with Ingresses and Services of `type=LoadBalancer` and nodes in various DNS providers:

- [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/)
- [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- [AWS Cloud Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/)
- [AzureDNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/dns)
- [Civo](https://www.civo.com)
- [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/networking)
- [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/)
- [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/)
- [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/)
- [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/dns/)
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DNS](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/DNS/Concepts/dnszonemanagement.htm)
- [Linode DNS](https://www.linode.com/docs/networking/dns/)
- [RFC2136](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136)
- [NS1](https://ns1.com/)
- [TransIP](https://www.transip.eu/domain-name/)
- [OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com)

- [Akamai Edge DNS](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/products/cloud_security/edge_dns.html)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com)
- [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net)
- [IBM Cloud DNS](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/dns)
- [TencentCloud PrivateDNS](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/privatedns)
- [TencentCloud DNSPod](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/cns)
- [Plural](https://www.plural.sh/)
- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)

ExternalDNS is, by default, aware of the records it is managing, therefore it can safely manage non-empty hosted zones.
We strongly encourage you to set `--txt-owner-id` to a unique value that doesn&#039;t change for the lifetime of your cluster.
You might also want to run ExternalDNS in a dry run mode (`--dry-run` flag) to see the changes to be submitted to your DNS Provider API.

Note that all flags can be replaced with environment variables; for instance,
`--dry-run` could be replaced with `EXTERNAL_DNS_DRY_RUN=1`.

## New providers

No new provider will be added to ExternalDNS *in-tree*.

ExternalDNS has introduced a webhook system, which can be used to add a new provider.
See PR #3063 for all the discussions about it.

## Status of in-tree providers

ExternalDNS supports multiple DNS providers which have been implemented by the [ExternalDNS contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/graphs/contributors).
Maintaining all of those in a central repository is a challenge, which introduces lots of toil and potential risks.

This mean that `external-dns` has begun the process to move providers out of tree. See #4347 for more details.
Those who are interested can create a webhook provider based on an *in-tree* provider and after submit a PR to reference it here.

We define the following stability levels for providers:

- **Stable**: Used for smoke tests before a release, used in production and maintainers are active.
- **Beta**: Community supported, well tested, but maintainers have no access to resources to execute integration tests on the real platform and/or are not using it in production.
- **Alpha**: Community provided with no support from the maintainers apart from reviewing PRs.

The following table clarifies the current status of the providers according to the aforementioned stability levels:

| Provider | Status | Maintainers |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Google Cloud DNS | Stable | |
| AWS Route 53 | Stable | |
| AWS Cloud Map | Beta | |
| Akamai Edge DNS | Beta | |

### Running Locally

See the [contributor guide](docs/contributing/getting-started.md) for details on compiling
from source.

#### Setup Steps

Next, run an application and expose it via a Kubernetes Service:

```console
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80
kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

Annotate the Service with your desired external DNS name. Make sure to change `example.org` to your domain.

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname=nginx.example.org.&quot;
```

Optionally, you can customize the TTL value of the resulting DNS record by using the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl` annotation:

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=10&quot;
```

For more details on configuring TTL, see [here](docs/ttl.md).

Use the internal-hostname annotation to create DNS records with ClusterIP as the target.

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname=nginx.internal.example.org.&quot;
```

If the service is not of type Loadbalancer you need the --publish-internal-services flag.

Locally run a single sync loop of ExternalDNS.

```console
external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service --once --dry-run
```

This should output the DNS records it will modify to match the managed zone with the DNS records you desire.
It also assumes you are running in the `default` namespace. See the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for more information regarding namespaces.

Note: TXT records will have the `my-cluster-id` value embedded. Those are used to ensure that ExternalDNS is aware of the records it manages.

Once you&#039;re satisfied with the result, you can run ExternalDNS like you would run it in your cluster: as a control loop, and **not in dry-run** mode:

```console
external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service
```

Check that ExternalDNS has created the desired DNS record for your Service and that it points to its load balancer&#039;s IP. Then try to resolve it:

```console
dig +short nginx.example.org.
104.155.60.49
```

Now you can experiment and watch how ExternalDNS makes sure that your DNS records are configured as desired. Here are a couple of things you can try out:

- Change the desired hostname by modifying the Service&#039;s annotation.
- Recreate the Service and see that the DNS record will be updated to point to the new load balancer IP.
- Add another Service to create more DNS records.
- Remove Services to clean up your managed zone.

The **tutorials** section contains examples, including Ingress resources, and shows you how to set up ExternalDNS in different environments such as other cloud providers and alternative Ingress controllers.

# Note

If using a txt registry and attempting to use a CNAME the `--txt-prefix` must be set to avoid conflicts.  Changing `--txt-prefix` will result in lost ownership over previously created records.

If `externalIPs` list is defined for a `LoadBalancer` service, this list will be used instead of an assigned load balancer IP to create a DNS record.
It&#039;s useful when you run bare metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT or in a similar setup, where a load balancer IP differs from a public IP (e.g. with [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf)).

## Contributing

Are you interested in contributing to external-dns? We, the maintainers and community, would love your
suggestions, contributions, and help! Also, the maintainers can be contacted at any time to learn more
about how to get involved.

We also encourage ALL active community participants to act as if they are maintainers, even if you don&#039;t have
&quot;official&quot; write permissions. This is a community effort, we are here to serve the Kubernetes community. If you
have an active interest and you want to get involved, you have real power! Don&#039;t assume that the only people who
can get things done around here are the &quot;maintainers&quot;. We also would love to add more &quot;official&quot; maintainers, so
show us what you can do!

The external-dns project is currently in need of maintainers for specific DNS providers. Ideally each provider
would have at least two maintainers. It would be nice if the maintainers run the provider in production, but it
is not strictly required. Provider listed [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns#status-of-in-tree-providers)
that do not have a maintainer listed are in need of assistance.

Read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and have a look at [the contributing docs](docs/contributing/dev-guide.md) to learn about building the project, the project structure, and the purpose of each package.

For an overview on how to write new Sources and Providers check out [Sources and Providers](docs/contributing/sources-and-providers.md).

## Heritage

ExternalDNS is an effort to unify the following similar projects in order to bring the Kubernetes community an easy and predictable way of managing DNS records across cloud providers based on their Kubernetes resources:

- Kops&#039; [DNS Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/HEAD/dns-controller)
- Zalando&#039;s [Mate](https://github.com/linki/mate)
- Molecule Software&#039;s [route53-kubernetes](https://github.com/wearemolecule/route53-kubernetes)

The present repository contains the source code of the Datadog Agent version 7 and version 6. Please refer to the [Agent user documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) for information about differences between Agent v5, Agent v6 and Agent v7. Additionally, we provide a list of prepackaged binaries for an easy install process [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings/agent/latest?platform=overview)

**Note:** the source code of Datadog Agent v5 is located in the
[dd-agent](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent) repository.

## Documentation

The general documentation of the project, including instructions for installation
and development, is located under [the docs directory](docs) of the present repo.

## Getting started

To build the Agent you need:
 * [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.23 or later. You&#039;ll also need to set your `$GOPATH` and have `$GOPATH/bin` in your path.
 * Python 3.11+ along with development libraries for tooling. You will also need Python 2.7 if you are building the Agent with Python 2 support.
 * Python dependencies. You may install these with `pip install dda`.
 * CMake version 3.15 or later and a C++ compiler

**Note:** you may want to use a python virtual environment to avoid polluting your
      system-wide python environment with the agent build/dev dependencies. You can
      create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` and then use the `dda inv agent.build`
      parameters `--python-home-3=&lt;venv_path&gt;` to use the virtual environment&#039;s
      interpreter and libraries. By default, this environment is only used for dev dependencies.

**Note:** You may have previously installed `invoke` via brew on MacOS, or `pip` in
      any other platform. We recommend you use the version pinned in the requirements
      file for a smooth development/build experience.

**Note:** You can enable auto completion for invoke tasks. Use the command below to add the appropriate line to your `.zshrc` file.
      `echo &quot;source &lt;(dda inv --print-completion-script zsh)&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc`

Builds and tests are orchestrated with `invoke`, type `dda inv --list` on a shell
to see the available tasks.

To start working on the Agent, you can build the `main` branch:

1. Checkout the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
2. cd into the project folder: `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
3. Install go tools: `dda inv install-tools` (if you have a timeout error, you might need to prepend the `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,https://goproxy.io,direct` env var to the command).
4. Create a development `datadog.yaml` configuration file in `dev/dist/datadog.yaml`, containing a valid API key: `api_key: &lt;API_KEY&gt;`. You can either start with an empty one or use the full one generated by the Agent build from Step 5 (located in `cmd/agent/dist/datadog.yaml` after the build finishes).
5. Build the agent with `dda inv agent.build --build-exclude=systemd`.

     You can specify a custom Python location for the agent (useful when using
     virtualenvs):

       dda inv agent.build \
         --python-home-3=$GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/venv3

    Running `dda inv agent.build`:

     * Discards any changes done in `bin/agent/dist`.
     * Builds the Agent and writes the binary to `bin/agent/agent`.
     * Copies files from `dev/dist` to `bin/agent/dist`. See `https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/dev/dist/README.md` for more information.

     If you built an older version of the agent, you may have the error `make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.`. To solve the issue, you should remove `CMakeCache.txt` from `rtloader` folder with `rm rtloader/CMakeCache.txt`.

     Please note that the [trace agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/) needs to be built and run separately.



Please refer to the [Agent Developer Guide](docs/dev/README.md) for more details. For instructions
on setting up a windows dev environment, refer to [Windows Dev Env](devenv).

## Testing

Run unit tests using `dda inv test`.
```
dda inv test --targets=./pkg/aggregator
```

You can also use `dda inv linter.go` to run just the go linters.
```
dda inv linter.go
```

When testing code that depends on [rtloader](/rtloader), build and install it first.
```
dda inv rtloader.make &amp;&amp; dda inv rtloader.install
dda inv test --targets=./pkg/collector/python
```

## Run

You can run the agent with:
```
./bin/agent/agent run -c bin/agent/dist/datadog.yaml
```

The file `bin/agent/dist/datadog.yaml` is copied from `dev/dist/datadog.yaml` by `dda inv agent.build` and must contain a valid api key.

### Run a JMX check
In order to run a JMX based check locally, you must have:
1. A copy of a JMXFetch `jar` copied to `dev/dist/jmx/jmxfetch.jar`
2. `java` available on your `$PATH`

For detailed instructions, see [JMX checks](./docs/dev/checks/jmxfetch.md)

# Overview

**Eino[&#039;aino]** (pronounced similarly to &quot;I know&quot;) aims to be the ultimate LLM application development framework in Golang. Drawing inspirations from many excellent LLM application development frameworks in the open-source community such as LangChain &amp; LlamaIndex, etc., as well as learning from cutting-edge research and real world applications, Eino offers an LLM application development framework that emphasizes on simplicity, scalability, reliability and effectiveness that better aligns with Golang programming conventions.

What Eino provides are:
- a carefully curated list of **component** abstractions and implementations that can be easily reused and combined to build LLM applications
- a powerful **composition** framework that does the heavy lifting of strong type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection, option assignment, etc. for the user.
- a set of meticulously designed **API** that obsesses on simplicity and clarity.
- an ever-growing collection of best practices in the form of bundled **flows** and **examples**.
- a useful set of tools that covers the entire development cycle, from visualized development and debugging to online tracing and evaluation.

With the above arsenal, Eino can standardize, simplify, and improve efficiency at different stages of the AI application development cycle:
![](.github/static/img/eino/eino_concept.jpeg)

# A quick walkthrough

Use a component directly:
```Go
model, _ := openai.NewChatModel(ctx, config) // create an invokable LLM instance
message, _ := model.Generate(ctx, []*Message{
    SystemMessage(&quot;you are a helpful assistant.&quot;),
    UserMessage(&quot;what does the future AI App look like?&quot;)})
```

Of course, you can do that, Eino provides lots of useful components to use out of the box. But you can do more by using orchestration, for three reasons:
- orchestration encapsulates common patterns of LLM application.
- orchestration solves the difficult problem of processing stream response by the LLM.
- orchestration handles type safety, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment for you.

Eino provides two set of APIs for orchestration

| API      | Characteristics and usage                                             |
| -------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chain    | Simple chained directed graph that can only go forward.               |
| Graph    | Cyclic or Acyclic directed graph. Powerful and flexible.              |

Let&#039;s create a simple chain: a ChatTemplate followed by a ChatModel.

![](.github/static/img/eino/simple_chain.png)

```Go
chain, _ := NewChain[map[string]any, *Message]().
           AppendChatTemplate(prompt).
           AppendChatModel(model).
           Compile(ctx)

chain.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;what&#039;s your name?&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a graph that uses a ChatModel to generate answer or tool calls, then uses a ToolsNode to execute those tools if needed.

![](.github/static/img/eino/tool_call_graph.png)

```Go
graph := NewGraph[map[string]any, *schema.Message]()

_ = graph.AddChatTemplateNode(&quot;node_template&quot;, chatTpl)
_ = graph.AddChatModelNode(&quot;node_model&quot;, chatModel)
_ = graph.AddToolsNode(&quot;node_tools&quot;, toolsNode)
_ = graph.AddLambdaNode(&quot;node_converter&quot;, takeOne)

_ = graph.AddEdge(START, &quot;node_template&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_template&quot;, &quot;node_model&quot;)
_ = graph.AddBranch(&quot;node_model&quot;, branch)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_tools&quot;, &quot;node_converter&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_converter&quot;, END)

compiledGraph, err := graph.Compile(ctx)
if err != nil {
return err
}
out, err := r.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;:&quot;Beijing&#039;s weather this weekend&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a &#039;ReAct&#039; agent: A ChatModel binds to Tools. It receives input Messages and decides independently whether to call the Tool or output the final result. The execution result of the Tool will again become the input Message for the ChatModel and serve as the context for the next round of independent judgment.

![](.github/static/img/eino/react.png)

We provide a complete implementation for ReAct Agent out of the box in the `flow` package. Check out the code here: [flow/agent/react](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino/blob/main/flow/agent/react/react.go)

Our implementation of ReAct Agent uses Eino&#039;s **graph orchestration** exclusively, which provides the following benefits out of the box:
- Type checking: it makes sure the two nodes&#039; input and output types match at compile time.
- Stream processing: concatenates message stream before passing to chatModel and toolsNode if needed, and copies the stream into callback handlers.
- Concurrency management: the shared state can be safely read and written because the StatePreHandler is concurrency safe.
- Aspect injection: injects callback aspects before and after the execution of ChatModel if the specified ChatModel implementation hasn&#039;t injected itself.
- Option assignment: call options are assigned either globally, to specific component type or to specific node.

For example, you could easily extend the compiled graph with callbacks:
```Go
handler := NewHandlerBuilder().
  OnStartFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, input CallbackInput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onStart, runInfo: %v, input: %v&quot;, info, input)
    }).
  OnEndFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, output CallbackOutput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onEnd, runInfo: %v, out: %v&quot;, info, output)
    }).
  Build()
  
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))
```

or you could easily assign options to different nodes:
```Go
// assign to All nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))

// assign only to ChatModel nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithChatModelOption(WithTemperature(0.5))

// assign only to node_1
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler).DesignateNode(&quot;node_1&quot;))
```

# Key Features

## Rich Components

- Encapsulates common building blocks into **component abstractions**, each have multiple **component implementations** that are ready to be used out of the box.
    - component abstractions such as ChatModel, Tool, ChatTemplate, Retriever, Document Loader, Lambda, etc.
    - each component type has an interface of its own: defined Input &amp; Output Type, defined Option type, and streaming paradigms that make sense.
    - implementations are transparent. Abstractions are all you care about when orchestrating components together.

- Implementations can be nested and captures complex business logic.
    - ReAct Agent, MultiQueryRetriever, Host MultiAgent, etc. They consist of multiple components and non-trivial business logic.
    - They are still transparent from the outside. A MultiQueryRetriever can be used anywhere that accepts a Retriever.

## Powerful Orchestration

- Data flows from Retriever / Document Loaders / ChatTemplate to ChatModel, then flows to Tools and parsed as Final Answer. This directed, controlled flow of data through multiple components can be implemented through **graph orchestration**.
- Component instances are graph nodes, and edges are data flow channels.
- Graph orchestration is powerful and flexible enough to implement complex business logic:
  - type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment are handled by the framework.
  - branch out execution at runtime, read and write global state, or do field level data mapping using workflow(currently in alpha stage).


## Complete Stream Processing

- Stream processing is important because ChatModel outputs chunks of messages in real time as it generates them. It&#039;s especially important with orchestration because more components need to handle streaming data.
- Eino automatically **concatenates** stream chunks for downstream nodes that only accepts non-stream input, such as ToolsNode.
- Eino automatically **boxes** non stream into stream when stream is needed during graph execution.  
- Eino automatically **merges** multiple streams as they converge into a single downward node.
- Eino automatically **copies** stream as they fan out to different downward node, or is passed to callback handlers.
- Orchestration elements such as **branch** and **state handlers** are also stream aware.
- With these streaming processing abilities, the streaming paradigms of components themselves become transparent to the user. 
- A compiled Graph can run with 4 different streaming paradigms:

| Streaming Paradigm | Explanation                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invoke             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns non-stream type O                     |
| Stream             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns stream type StreamReader[O]           |
| Collect            | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns non-stream type O           |
| Transform          | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns stream type StreamReader[O] |

## Highly Extensible Aspects (Callbacks)

- Aspects handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, tracing, metrics, etc., as well as exposing internal details of component implementations.
- Five aspects are supported: **OnStart, OnEnd, OnError, OnStartWithStreamInput, OnEndWithStreamOutput**.
- Developers can easily create custom callback handlers, add them during graph run via options, and they will be invoked during graph run.
- Graph can also inject aspects to those component implementations that do not support callbacks on their own.

# Eino Framework Structure

![](.github/static/img/eino/eino_framework.jpeg)

The Eino framework consists of several parts:

- Eino(this repo): Contains Eino&#039;s type definitions, streaming mechanism, component abstractions, orchestration capabilities, aspect mechanisms, etc.

- [EinoExt](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-ext): Component implementations, callback handlers implementations, component usage examples, and various tools such as evaluators, prompt optimizers.

- [Eino Devops](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-ext/tree/main/devops): visualized developing, visualized debugging
  etc.

- [EinoExamples](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples) is the repo containing example applications and best practices for Eino.

## Detailed Documentation

For learning and using Eino, we provide a comprehensive Eino User Manual to help you quickly understand the concepts in Eino and master the skills of developing AI applications based on Eino. Start exploring through the [Eino User Manual](https://www.cloudwego.io/zh/docs/eino/) now!

For a quick introduction to building AI applications with Eino, we recommend starting with [Eino: Quick Start](https://www.cloudwego.io/zh/docs/eino/quick_start/)

## Dependencies
- Go 1.18 and above.
- Eino relies on [kin-openapi](https://github.com/getkin/kin-openapi) &#039;s OpenAPI JSONSchema implementation. In order to remain compatible with Go 1.18, we have fixed kin-openapi&#039;s version to be v0.118.0.

### Server SDKs

Server SDKs enable your backend to generate [access tokens](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/),
call [server APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/server/server-apis/), and
receive [webhooks](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/webhooks/). In addition, the Go SDK includes client capabilities,
enabling you to build automations that behave like end-users.

### Tools

-   [CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) - command line interface &amp; load tester
-   [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/livekit/livekit-server)
-   [Helm charts](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-helm)

## Install

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend installing [LiveKit CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) along with the server. It lets you access
&gt; server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic.

The following will install LiveKit&#039;s media server:

### MacOS

```shell
brew install livekit
```

### Linux

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io | bash
```

### Windows

Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases/latest)

## Getting Started

### Starting LiveKit

Start LiveKit in development mode by running `livekit-server --dev`. It&#039;ll use a placeholder API key/secret pair.

```
API Key: devkey
API Secret: secret
```

To customize your setup for production, refer to our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/)

### Creating access token

A user connecting to a LiveKit room requires an [access token](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/#creating-a-token). Access
tokens (JWT) encode the user&#039;s identity and the room permissions they&#039;ve been granted. You can generate a token with our
CLI:

```shell
lk token create \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --join --room my-first-room --identity user1 \
    --valid-for 24h
```

### Test with example app

Head over to our [example app](https://example.livekit.io) and enter a generated token to connect to your LiveKit
server. This app is built with our [React SDK](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-react).

Once connected, your video and audio are now being published to your new LiveKit instance!

### Simulating a test publisher

```shell
lk room join \
    --url ws://localhost:7880 \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --identity bot-user1 \
    --publish-demo \
    my-first-room
```

This command publishes a looped demo video to a room. Due to how the video clip was encoded (keyframes every 3s),
there&#039;s a slight delay before the browser has sufficient data to begin rendering frames. This is an artifact of the
simulation.

## Deployment

### Use LiveKit Cloud

LiveKit Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run LiveKit. Every project gets free monthly bandwidth and
transcoding credits.

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

### Self-host

            <h2>README</h2><pre># GitHub CLI

`gh` is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code.

![screenshot of gh pr status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98482/84171218-327e7a80-aa40-11ea-8cd1-5177fc2d0e72.png)

GitHub CLI is supported for users on GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+ with support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Documentation

For [installation options see below](#installation), for usage instructions [see the manual][manual].

### Linux &amp; BSD

`gh` is available via:
- [our Debian and RPM repositories](./docs/install_linux.md);
- community-maintained repositories in various Linux distros;
- OS-agnostic package managers such as [Homebrew](#homebrew), [Conda](#conda), [Spack](#spack), [Webi](#webi); and
- our [releases page][] as precompiled binaries.

For more information, see [Linux &amp; BSD installation](./docs/install_linux.md).

### Codespaces

To add GitHub CLI to your codespace, add the following to your [devcontainer file](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-features-to-a-devcontainer-file):

```json
&quot;features&quot;: {
  &quot;ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1&quot;: {}
}
```

### GitHub Actions

GitHub CLI comes pre-installed in all [GitHub-Hosted Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

### Other platforms

Download packaged binaries from the [releases page][].

#### Verification of binaries

Since version 2.50.0 `gh` has been producing [Build Provenance Attestation](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-06-25-artifact-attestations-is-generally-available/) enabling a cryptographically verifiable paper-trail back to the origin GitHub repository, git revision and build instructions used. The build provenance attestations are signed and relies on Public Good [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) for PKI.

There are two common ways to verify a downloaded release, depending if `gh` is already installed or not. If `gh` is installed, it&#039;s trivial to verify a new release:

- **Option 1: Using `gh` if already installed:**

  ```shell
  $ gh at verify -R cli/cli gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded digest sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc for file://gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
  ✓ Verification succeeded!

  sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc was attested by:
  REPO     PREDICATE_TYPE                  WORKFLOW
  cli/cli  https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1  .github/workflows/deployment.yml@refs/heads/trunk
  ```

- **Option 2: Using Sigstore [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign):**

  To perform this, download the [attestation](https://github.com/cli/cli/attestations) for the downloaded release and use cosign to verify the authenticity of the downloaded release:

  ```shell
  $ cosign verify-blob-attestation --bundle cli-cli-attestation-3120304.sigstore.json \
        --new-bundle-format \
        --certificate-oidc-issuer=&quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot; \
        --certificate-identity-regexp=&quot;^https://github.com/cli/cli/.github/workflows/deployment.yml@refs/heads/trunk$&quot; \
        gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Verified OK
  ```

### Build from source

See here on how to [build GitHub CLI from source][build from source].

## Comparison with hub

For many years, [hub][] was the unofficial GitHub CLI tool. `gh` is a new project that helps us explore
what an official GitHub CLI tool can look like with a fundamentally different design. While both
tools bring GitHub to the terminal, `hub` behaves as a proxy to `git`, and `gh` is a standalone
tool. Check out our [more detailed explanation][gh-vs-hub] to learn more.

Usage
-----
A basic example:

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;log&quot;

    &quot;github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify&quot;
)

func main() {
    // Create new watcher.
    watcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer watcher.Close()

    // Start listening for events.
    go func() {
        for {
            select {
            case event, ok := &lt;-watcher.Events:
                if !ok {
                    return
                }
                log.Println(&quot;event:&quot;, event)
                if event.Has(fsnotify.Write) {
                    log.Println(&quot;modified file:&quot;, event.Name)
                }
            case err, ok := &lt;-watcher.Errors:
                if !ok {
                    return
                }
                log.Println(&quot;error:&quot;, err)
            }
        }
    }()

    // Add a path.
    err = watcher.Add(&quot;/tmp&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Block main goroutine forever.
    &lt;-make(chan struct{})
}
```

Some more examples can be found in [cmd/fsnotify](cmd/fsnotify), which can be
run with:

FAQ
---
### Will a file still be watched when it&#039;s moved to another directory?
No, not unless you are watching the location it was moved to.

### Are subdirectories watched?
No, you must add watches for any directory you want to watch (a recursive
watcher is on the roadmap: [#18]).

[#18]: https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/18

### Do I have to watch the Error and Event channels in a goroutine?
Yes. You can read both channels in the same goroutine using `select` (you don&#039;t
need a separate goroutine for both channels; see the example).

### Why don&#039;t notifications work with NFS, SMB, FUSE, /proc, or /sys?
fsnotify requires support from underlying OS to work. The current NFS and SMB
protocols does not provide network level support for file notifications, and
neither do the /proc and /sys virtual filesystems.

This could be fixed with a polling watcher ([#9]), but it&#039;s not yet implemented.

[#9]: https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/9

### Why do I get many Chmod events?
Some programs may generate a lot of attribute changes; for example Spotlight on
macOS, anti-virus programs, backup applications, and some others are known to do
this. As a rule, it&#039;s typically best to ignore Chmod events. They&#039;re often not
useful, and tend to cause problems.

Spotlight indexing on macOS can result in multiple events (see [#15]). A
temporary workaround is to add your folder(s) to the *Spotlight Privacy
settings* until we have a native FSEvents implementation (see [#11]).

[#11]: https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/11
[#15]: https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/15

### Watching a file doesn&#039;t work well
Watching individual files (rather than directories) is generally not recommended
as many programs (especially editors) update files atomically: it will write to
a temporary file which is then moved to to destination, overwriting the original
(or some variant thereof). The watcher on the original file is now lost, as that
no longer exists.

The upshot of this is that a power failure or crash won&#039;t leave a half-written
file.

Watch the parent directory and use `Event.Name` to filter out files you&#039;re not
interested in. There is an example of this in `cmd/fsnotify/file.go`.

Platform-specific notes
-----------------------
### Linux
When a file is removed a REMOVE event won&#039;t be emitted until all file
descriptors are closed; it will emit a CHMOD instead:

    fp := os.Open(&quot;file&quot;)
    os.Remove(&quot;file&quot;)        // CHMOD
    fp.Close()               // REMOVE

This is the event that inotify sends, so not much can be changed about this.

The `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` sysctl variable specifies the upper limit for
the number of watches per user, and `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` specifies
the maximum number of inotify instances per user. Every Watcher you create is an
&quot;instance&quot;, and every path you add is a &quot;watch&quot;.

These are also exposed in `/proc` as `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches` and
`/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances`

To increase them you can use `sysctl` or write the value to proc file:

    # The default values on Linux 5.18
    sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=124983
    sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=128

To make the changes persist on reboot edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` or
`/usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-default.conf` (details differ per Linux distro; check your
distro&#039;s documentation):

    fs.inotify.max_user_watches=124983
    fs.inotify.max_user_instances=128

Reaching the limit will result in a &quot;no space left on device&quot; or &quot;too many open
files&quot; error.

### kqueue (macOS, all BSD systems)
kqueue requires opening a file descriptor for every file that&#039;s being watched;
so if you&#039;re watching a directory with five files then that&#039;s six file
descriptors. You will run in to your system&#039;s &quot;max open files&quot; limit faster on
these platforms.

The sysctl variables `kern.maxfiles` and `kern.maxfilesperproc` can be used to
control the maximum number of open files.

# pgx - PostgreSQL Driver and Toolkit

pgx is a pure Go driver and toolkit for PostgreSQL.

The pgx driver is a low-level, high performance interface that exposes PostgreSQL-specific features such as `LISTEN` /
`NOTIFY` and `COPY`. It also includes an adapter for the standard `database/sql` interface.

The toolkit component is a related set of packages that implement PostgreSQL functionality such as parsing the wire protocol
and type mapping between PostgreSQL and Go. These underlying packages can be used to implement alternative drivers,
proxies, load balancers, logical replication clients, etc.

## Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;

	&quot;github.com/jackc/pgx/v5&quot;
)

func main() {
	// urlExample := &quot;postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name&quot;
	conn, err := pgx.Connect(context.Background(), os.Getenv(&quot;DATABASE_URL&quot;))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Unable to connect to database: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer conn.Close(context.Background())

	var name string
	var weight int64
	err = conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), &quot;select name, weight from widgets where id=$1&quot;, 42).Scan(&amp;name, &amp;weight)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;QueryRow failed: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	fmt.Println(name, weight)
}
```

See the [getting started guide](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/wiki/Getting-started-with-pgx) for more information.

## Features

* Support for approximately 70 different PostgreSQL types
* Automatic statement preparation and caching
* Batch queries
* Single-round trip query mode
* Full TLS connection control
* Binary format support for custom types (allows for much quicker encoding/decoding)
* `COPY` protocol support for faster bulk data loads
* Tracing and logging support
* Connection pool with after-connect hook for arbitrary connection setup
* `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY`
* Conversion of PostgreSQL arrays to Go slice mappings for integers, floats, and strings
* `hstore` support
* `json` and `jsonb` support

* Simulated nested transactions with savepoints

## Choosing Between the pgx and database/sql Interfaces

The pgx interface is faster. Many PostgreSQL specific features such as `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` and `COPY` are not available
through the `database/sql` interface.

The pgx interface is recommended when:

1. The application only targets PostgreSQL.
2. No other libraries that require `database/sql` are in use.

It is also possible to use the `database/sql` interface and convert a connection to the lower-level pgx interface as needed.

## Testing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup instructions.

## Architecture

See the presentation at Golang Estonia, [PGX Top to Bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXMSWhcHCf8) for a description of pgx architecture.

## Supported Go and PostgreSQL Versions

pgx supports the same versions of Go and PostgreSQL that are supported by their respective teams. For [Go](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy) that is the two most recent major releases and for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) the major releases in the last 5 years. This means pgx supports Go 1.22 and higher and PostgreSQL 13 and higher. pgx also is tested against the latest version of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/).

## Version Policy

pgx follows semantic versioning for the documented public API on stable releases. `v5` is the latest stable major version.

## PGX Family Libraries

## About

The gRPC-Gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler
[protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).
It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which
translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the
[`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotations in your service definitions.

This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/assets/images/architecture_introduction_diagram.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Docs

You can read our docs at:

- https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/

## Testimonials

&gt; We use the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of API requests per day,
&gt; and have been since 2018 and through all of that,
&gt; we have never had any issues with it.
&gt;
&gt; _- William Mill, [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/)_

## Background

gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming
languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is
combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional
RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining
backward-compatibility, supporting languages or clients that are not well supported by
gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful
JSON architecture.

This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.
A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all
that&#039;s needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.

## Installation

### Compile from source

The following instructions assume you are using
[Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) for dependency
management. Use a
[tool dependency](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
to track the versions of the following executable packages:

```go
// +build tools

package tools

import (
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot;
)
```

Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running

```sh
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### **Using the `tool` Directive in Go 1.24**

Starting from Go 1.24, the `tool` directive in `go.mod` provides a structured way to track and manage executable dependencies. This replaces the previous workaround of using a separate `tools.go` file with blank imports.

#### **Tracking Tools in `go.mod`**

Instead of manually importing tool dependencies in a Go source file, you can now use the `tool` directive in `go.mod` to declare the tools your project depends on. For example:

```go
module tools

go 1.24

tool (
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
	google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
	google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
)
```

#### **Managing Tool Dependencies**

To add tools to your module, use the `-tool` flag with `go get`:

```sh
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
go get -tool google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
go get -tool google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This automatically updates `go.mod`, adding the tools under the `tool` directive along with `require` statements to ensure version tracking.

### Install Tools

Once the tool dependencies are properly recorded in the `go.mod` file, simply execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
go install ./...
```

### Download the binaries

You may alternatively download the binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
We generate [SLSA3 signatures](slsa.dev) using the OpenSSF&#039;s [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) during the release process. To verify a release binary:

1. Install the verification tool from [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation).
2. Download the provenance file `attestation.intoto.jsonl` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
3. Run the verifier:

```shell
slsa-verifier -artifact-path &lt;the-binary&gt; -provenance attestation.intoto.jsonl -source github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway -tag &lt;the-tag&gt;
```

Alternatively, see the section on remotely managed plugin versions below.

## Usage

### 1.Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers

`your_service.proto`:

```protobuf
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;

 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
   rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
 }
```

### 2. Generate gRPC stubs

This step generates the gRPC stubs that you can use to implement the service and consume from clients:

Here&#039;s an example `buf.gen.yaml` you can use to generate the stubs with [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf):

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

With this file in place, you can generate your files using `buf generate`.

&gt; For a complete example of using `buf generate` to generate protobuf stubs, see
&gt; [the boilerplate repo](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).
&gt; For more information on generating the stubs with buf, see
&gt; [the official documentation](https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage).

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, here&#039;s an example of what a command
might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . \
    --go_out ./gen/go/ --go_opt paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out ./gen/go/ --go-grpc_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 3. Implement your service in gRPC as usual.

### 4. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

At this point, you have 3 options:

- no further modifications, use the default mapping to HTTP semantics (method, path, etc.)
  - this will work on any `.proto` file, but will not allow setting HTTP paths, request parameters or similar
- additional `.proto` modifications to use a custom mapping
  - relies on parameters in the `.proto` file to set custom HTTP mappings
- no `.proto` modifications, but use an external configuration file
  - relies on an external configuration file to set custom HTTP mappings
  - mostly useful when the source proto file isn&#039;t under your control

#### 1. Using the default mapping

This requires no additional modification to the `.proto` file but does require enabling a specific option when executing the plugin.
The `generate_unbound_methods` should be enabled.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt generate_unbound_methods=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 2. With custom annotations

Add a [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotation to your .proto file

`your_service.proto`:

```diff
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;
+
+import &quot;google/api/annotations.proto&quot;;
+
 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
-  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
+  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
+    option (google.api.http) = {
+      post: &quot;/v1/example/echo&quot;
+      body: &quot;*&quot;
+    };
+  }
 }
```

&gt; You will need to provide the required third party protobuf files to the protobuf compiler.
&gt; If you are using [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf), this dependency can
&gt; be added to the `deps` array in your `buf.yaml` under the name
&gt; `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis`:
&gt;
&gt; ```yaml
&gt; version: v2
&gt; name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
&gt; deps:
&gt;   - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; Always run `buf dep update` after adding a dependency to your `buf.yaml`.

See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
and generated OpenAPI output.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you need to ensure the required
dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found
by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from the
[googleapis repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), and providing
them to `protoc` when running. The files you will need are:

```
google/api/annotations.proto
google/api/field_behavior.proto
google/api/http.proto
google/api/httpbody.proto
```

Here&#039;s what a `protoc` execution might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 3. External configuration

If you do not want to (or cannot) modify the proto file for use with gRPC-Gateway you can
alternatively use an external
[gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
[Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/)
for more information. This is best combined with the `standalone=true` option
to generate a file that can live in its own package, separate from the files
generated by the source protobuf file.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml \
    --grpc-gateway_opt standalone=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 5. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;flag&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog&quot;

  gw &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/proto/gen/go/your/service/v1/your_service&quot;  // Update
)

var (
  // command-line options:
  // gRPC server endpoint
  grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String(&quot;grpc-server-endpoint&quot;,  &quot;localhost:9090&quot;, &quot;gRPC server endpoint&quot;)
)

func run() error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()

  // Register gRPC server endpoint
  // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
  mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
  opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
  err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
  return http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8081&quot;, mux)
}

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  if err := run(); err != nil {
    grpclog.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

### 6. (Optional) Generate OpenAPI definitions using `protoc-gen-openapiv2`

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
  - local: protoc-gen-openapiv2
    out: gen/go
```

To use the custom protobuf annotations supported by `protoc-gen-openapiv2`, we need
another dependency added to our protobuf generation step. If you are using
`buf`, you can add the `buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway` dependency
to your `deps` array:

```yaml
version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
  - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
```

With `protoc` (just the swagger file):

```sh
protoc -I . --openapiv2_out ./gen/openapiv2 \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you will need to copy the protobuf
files from the `protoc-gen-openapiv2/options` directory of this repository,
and providing them to `protoc` when running.

Note that this plugin also supports generating OpenAPI definitions for unannotated methods;
use the `generate_unbound_methods` option to enable this.

It is possible with the HTTP mapping for a gRPC service method to create duplicate mappings
with the only difference being constraints on the path parameter.

`/v1/{name=projects/*}` and `/v1/{name=organizations/*}` both become `/v1/{name}`. When
this occurs the plugin will rename the path parameter with a &quot;\_1&quot; (or &quot;\_2&quot; etc) suffix
to differentiate the different operations. So in the above example, the 2nd path would become
`/v1/{name_1=organizations/*}`. This can also cause OpenAPI clients to URL encode the &quot;/&quot; that is
part of the path parameter as that is what OpenAPI defines in the specification. To allow gRPC gateway to
accept the URL encoded slash and still route the request, use the UnescapingModeAllCharacters or
UnescapingModeLegacy (which is the default currently though may change in future versions). See
[Customizing Your Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/)
for more information.

## Usage with remote plugins

As an alternative to all of the above, you can use `buf` with
[remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage)
to manage plugin versions and generation. An example `buf.gen.yaml` using remote
plugin generation looks like this:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.31.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.3.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/openapiv2:v2.16.2
    out: gen/openapiv2
```

This requires no local installation of any plugins. Be careful to use the same
version of the generator as the runtime library, i.e. if using `v2.16.2`, run

```shell
$ go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2@v2.16.2
```

To get the same version of the runtime in your `go.mod`.

Note that usage of remote plugins is incompatible with usage of external configuration files like [grpc_api_configuration](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/#using-an-external-configuration-file).

## Video intro

This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro to using the gRPC-Gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base: https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Parameters and flags

When using `buf` to generate stubs, flags and parameters are passed through
the `opt` field in your `buf.gen.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

During code generation with `protoc`, flags to gRPC-Gateway tools must be passed
through `protoc` using one of 2 patterns:

- as part of the `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out` `protoc` parameter: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out=&lt;flags&gt;:&lt;path&gt;`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
--openapiv2_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
```

- using additional `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt` parameters: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt=&lt;flag&gt;[,&lt;flag&gt;]*`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
--openapiv2_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
```

# Podman: A tool for managing OCI containers and pods
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)
![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/containers/podman)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/containers/libpod)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/containers/libpod)

&lt;br/&gt;

Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups of containers.
Podman runs containers on Linux, but can also be used on Mac and Windows systems using a Podman-managed virtual machine.
Podman is based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management that is also contained in this repository. The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes.

Podman releases a new major or minor release 4 times a year, during the second week of February, May, August, and November. Patch releases are more frequent and may occur at any time to get bugfixes out to users. All releases are PGP signed. Public keys of members of the team approved to make releases are located [here](https://github.com/containers/release-keys/tree/main/podman).

  * [Downloads](DOWNLOADS.md)

## Overview and scope

At a high level, the scope of Podman and libpod is the following:

* Support for multiple container image formats, including OCI and Docker images.
* Full management of those images, including pulling from various sources (including trust and verification), creating (built via Containerfile or Dockerfile or committed from a container), and pushing to registries and other storage backends.
* Full management of container lifecycle, including creation (both from an image and from an exploded root filesystem), running, checkpointing and restoring (via CRIU), and removal.
* Full management of container networking, using Netavark.
* Support for pods, groups of containers that share resources and are managed together.
* Support for running containers and pods without root or other elevated privileges.
* Resource isolation of containers and pods.
* Support for a Docker-compatible CLI interface, which can both run containers locally and on remote systems.
* No manager daemon, for improved security and lower resource utilization at idle.
* Support for a REST API providing both a Docker-compatible interface and an improved interface exposing advanced Podman functionality.
* Support for running on Windows and Mac via virtual machines run by `podman machine`.

## Roadmap

The future of Podman feature development can be found in its **[roadmap](ROADMAP.md)**.

## Communications

If you think you&#039;ve identified a security issue in the project, please *DO NOT* report the issue publicly via the GitHub issue tracker, mailing list, or IRC.
Instead, send an email with as many details as possible to `security@lists.podman.io`. This is a private mailing list for the core maintainers.

For general questions and discussion, please use Podman&#039;s
[channels](https://podman.io/community/#slack-irc-matrix-and-discord).

For discussions around issues/bugs and features, you can use the GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues)
and
[PRs](https://github.com/containers/podman/pulls)
tracking system.

There is also a [mailing list](https://lists.podman.io/archives/) at `lists.podman.io`.
You can subscribe by sending a message to `podman-join@lists.podman.io` with the subject `subscribe`.

## Rootless
Podman can be easily run as a normal user, without requiring a setuid binary.
When run without root, Podman containers use user namespaces to set root in the container to the user running Podman.
Rootless Podman runs locked-down containers with no privileges that the user running the container does not have.
Some of these restrictions can be lifted (via `--privileged`, for example), but rootless containers will never have more privileges than the user that launched them.
If you run Podman as your user and mount in `/etc/passwd` from the host, you still won&#039;t be able to change it, since your user doesn&#039;t have permission to do so.

Almost all normal Podman functionality is available, though there are some [shortcomings](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/rootless.md).
Any recent Podman release should be able to run rootless without any additional configuration, though your operating system may require some additional configuration detailed in the [install guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

A little configuration by an administrator is required before rootless Podman can be used, the necessary setup is documented [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md).

## Podman Desktop

[Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) provides a local development environment for Podman and Kubernetes on Linux, Windows, and Mac machines.
It is a full-featured desktop UI frontend for Podman which uses the `podman machine` backend on non-Linux operating systems to run containers.
It supports full container lifecycle management (building, pulling, and pushing images, creating and managing containers, creating and managing pods, and working with Kubernetes YAML).
The project develops on [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop) and contributions are welcome.

## Out of scope

* Specialized signing and pushing of images to various storage backends.
  See [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/) for those tasks.
* Support for the Kubernetes CRI interface for container management.
  The [CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) daemon specializes in that.

## OCI Projects Plans

Podman uses OCI projects and best of breed libraries for different aspects:
- Runtime: We use the [OCI runtime tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) to generate OCI runtime configurations that can be used with any OCI-compliant runtime, like [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun/) and [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/).
- Images: Image management uses the [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image) library.
- Storage: Container and image storage is managed by [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage).
- Networking: Networking support through use of [Netavark](https://github.com/containers/netavark) and [Aardvark](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns).  Rootless networking is handled via [pasta](https://passt.top/passt) or [slirp4netns](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns).
- Builds: Builds are supported via [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah).
- Conmon: [Conmon](https://github.com/containers/conmon) is a tool for monitoring OCI runtimes, used by both Podman and CRI-O.
- Seccomp: A unified [Seccomp](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/pkg/seccomp/seccomp.json) policy for Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O.

## Buildah and Podman relationship

Buildah and Podman are two complementary open-source projects that are
available on most Linux platforms and both projects reside at
[GitHub.com](https://github.com) with Buildah
[here](https://github.com/containers/buildah) and Podman
[here](https://github.com/containers/podman).  Both, Buildah and Podman are
command line tools that work on Open Container Initiative (OCI) images and
containers.  The two projects differentiate in their specialization.

Buildah specializes in building OCI images.  Buildah&#039;s commands replicate all
of the commands that are found in a Dockerfile.  This allows building images
with and without Dockerfiles while not requiring any root privileges.
Buildah’s ultimate goal is to provide a lower-level coreutils interface to
build images.  The flexibility of building images without Dockerfiles allows
for the integration of other scripting languages into the build process.
Buildah follows a simple fork-exec model and does not run as a daemon
but it is based on a comprehensive API in golang, which can be vendored
into other tools.

Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify
OCI images, such as pulling and tagging.  It also allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers
created from those images.  For building container images via Dockerfiles, Podman uses Buildah&#039;s
golang API and can be installed independently from Buildah.

A major difference between Podman and Buildah is their concept of a container.  Podman
allows users to create &quot;traditional containers&quot; where the intent of these containers is
to be long lived.  While Buildah containers are really just created to allow content
to be added back to the container image.  An easy way to think of it is the
`buildah run` command emulates the RUN command in a Dockerfile while the `podman run`
command emulates the `docker run` command in functionality.  Because of this and their underlying
storage differences, you can not see Podman containers from within Buildah or vice versa.

In short, Buildah is an efficient way to create OCI images while Podman allows
you to manage and maintain those images and containers in a production environment using
familiar container cli commands.  For more details, see the
[Container Tools Guide](https://github.com/containers/buildah/tree/main/docs/containertools).

**Authelia** is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single
sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. It acts as a companion for [reverse proxies](#proxy-support) by
allowing, denying, or redirecting requests.

Documentation is available at [https://www.authelia.com/](https://www.authelia.com/).

The following is a simple diagram of the architecture:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin:50px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.authelia.com/images/archi.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**Authelia** can be installed as a standalone service from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/authelia/),
[APT](https://apt.authelia.com/stable/debian/packages/authelia/),
[FreeBSD Ports](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/www/authelia/), or using a
[static binary](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest),
[.deb package](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest), as a container on [Docker] or [Kubernetes].


Deployment can be orchestrated via the Helm [Chart](https://charts.authelia.com) (beta) leveraging ingress controllers
and ingress configurations.

* Choice between one-factor and two-factor policies per-rule.
* Support of basic authentication for endpoints protected by the one-factor policy.
* Highly available using a remote database and Redis as a highly available KV store.
* Compatible with [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik) out of the box using the
  [ForwardAuth](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/forwardauth/) middleware.
* Curated configuration from [LinuxServer](https://www.linuxserver.io/) via their
  [SWAG](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag) container as well as a
  [guide](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2020/08/26/setting-up-authelia/).
* Compatible with [Caddy] using the [forward_auth](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/forward_auth)
  directive.
* Kubernetes Support:
  * Compatible with several Kubernetes ingress controllers:
    * [ingress-nginx](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/nginx-ingress/)
    * [Traefik Kubernetes CRD](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/traefik-ingress/#ingressroute)
    * [Traefik Kubernetes Ingress](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/traefik-ingress/#ingress)
    * [Istio](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/istio/)

&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting Started

See the [Get Started Guide](https://www.authelia.com/integration/prologue/get-started/) or one of the curated examples
below.

### docker compose

The `docker compose` bundles act as a starting point for anyone wanting to see Authelia in action. You will have to
customize them to your needs as they come with self-signed certificates.

#### [Local](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/#local)
The Local compose bundle is intended to test Authelia without worrying about configuration.
It&#039;s meant to be used for scenarios where the server is not be exposed to the internet.
Domains will be defined in the local hosts file and self-signed certificates will be utilised.

#### [Lite](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/#lite)
The Lite compose bundle is intended for scenarios where the server will be exposed to the internet, domains and DNS will
need to be setup accordingly and certificates will be generated through LetsEncrypt. The Lite element refers to minimal
external dependencies; File based user storage, SQLite based configuration storage. In this configuration, the service
will not scale well.

## Deployment

Now that you have tested **Authelia** and you want to try it out in your own infrastructure,
you can learn how to deploy and use it with [Deployment](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/introduction/).
This guide will show you how to deploy it on bare metal as well as on
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Security

Authelia takes security very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in Authelia, please see our
[Security Policy](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/security/policy).

For more information about [security](https://www.authelia.com/policies/security/) related matters, please read

## Breaking changes

Since Authelia is still under active development, it is subject to breaking changes. It&#039;s recommended to pin a version
tag instead of using the `latest` tag and reading the [release notes](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases)
before upgrading. This is where you will find information about breaking changes and what you should do to overcome
said changes.

## Why Open Source?

You might wonder why Authelia is open source while it adds a great deal of security and user experience to your
infrastructure at zero cost. It is open source because we firmly believe that security should be available for all to
benefit in the face of the battlefield which is the Internet, with near zero effort.

Additionally, keeping the code open source is a way to leave it auditable by anyone who is willing to contribute. This
way, you can be confident that the product remains secure and does not act maliciously.

It&#039;s important to keep in mind Authelia is not directly exposed on the
Internet (your reverse proxies are) however, it&#039;s still the control plane for your internal security so take care of it!

btcd is an alternative full node bitcoin implementation written in Go (golang).

This project is currently under active development and is in a Beta state.  It
is extremely stable and has been in production use since October 2013.

It properly downloads, validates, and serves the block chain using the exact
rules (including consensus bugs) for block acceptance as Bitcoin Core.  We have
taken great care to avoid btcd causing a fork to the block chain.  It includes a
full block validation testing framework which contains all of the &#039;official&#039;
block acceptance tests (and some additional ones) that is run on every pull
request to help ensure it properly follows consensus.  Also, it passes all of
the JSON test data in the Bitcoin Core code.

It also properly relays newly mined blocks, maintains a transaction pool, and
relays individual transactions that have not yet made it into a block.  It
ensures all individual transactions admitted to the pool follow the rules
required by the block chain and also includes more strict checks which filter
transactions based on miner requirements (&quot;standard&quot; transactions).

One key difference between btcd and Bitcoin Core is that btcd does *NOT* include
wallet functionality and this was a very intentional design decision.  See the
blog entry [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20171125143919/https://blog.conformal.com/btcd-not-your-moms-bitcoin-daemon)
for more details.  This means you can&#039;t actually make or receive payments
directly with btcd.  That functionality is provided by the
[btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet) and
[Paymetheus](https://github.com/btcsuite/Paymetheus) (Windows-only) projects
which are both under active development.

## Requirements

[Go](http://golang.org) 1.22 or newer.

## Installation

https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/releases

#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Install Go according to the installation instructions here:
  http://golang.org/doc/install

- Ensure Go was installed properly and is a supported version:

```bash
$ go version
$ go env GOROOT GOPATH
```

NOTE: The `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` above must not be the same path.  It is
recommended that `GOPATH` is set to a directory in your home directory such as
`~/goprojects` to avoid write permission issues.  It is also recommended to add
`$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH` at this point.

- Run the following commands to obtain btcd, all dependencies, and install it:

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/btcsuite/btcd
$ go install -v . ./cmd/...
```

- btcd (and utilities) will now be installed in ```$GOPATH/bin```.  If you did
  not already add the bin directory to your system path during Go installation,
  we recommend you do so now.

## Updating

#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Run the following commands to update btcd, all dependencies, and install it:

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/btcsuite/btcd
$ git pull
$ go install -v . ./cmd/...
```

## Getting Started

btcd has several configuration options available to tweak how it runs, but all
of the basic operations described in the intro section work with zero
configuration.

#### Linux/BSD/POSIX/Source

```bash
$ ./btcd
```

## 算法 Algorithm

由于算法知识点繁杂，将自己学习到的算法、做过的题目分类整理好是有必要的。

一个算法模板应当涵盖以下几点：
- 对该算法的基本介绍（核心思想、复杂度等）
- 参考链接或书籍章节（讲得比较好的资料）
- 模板代码（代码注释、使用说明）
- 模板补充（常见题型中的额外代码、建模技巧等）
- 相关题目（模板题、经典题、思维转换题等）

## 如何选择题目 How to Choose Problems

### Rating &lt; 2100

这一阶段主要目标是提高对问题的观察能力。做构造题可以针对性地训练这一点。

选择难度在自己 rating 到 rating+200 范围内的构造题 (tag: constructive algorithms)，按照过题人数降序做题，比如 [1700,1900] 区间的就是下面这个链接：

[https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC&amp;tags=constructive+algorithms%2C1700-1900](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC&amp;tags=constructive+algorithms%2C1700-1900)

通过大量的构造题训练，提高观察能力，快速找到切题入口。具体见我在知乎上的这篇 [回答](https://www.zhihu.com/question/353734418/answer/2353160035)。

### Rating &gt;= 2100（个人训练用，仅供参考）

见识更高的山、更广的海。

按人数从高到低，做 2200+ 的题目。**建议不设置难度上限**！由于按人数排序，难度分不会太高，**不设上限可以避免错过高分好题**。

- [字符串 2200+](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC&amp;tags=combine-tags-by-or%2Cstring+suffix+structures%2Cstrings%2C2200-)：数据结构题不好筛选，可以找树状数组/线段树的题单，这里只单独筛选字符串的题。
- [交互 2200+](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC&amp;tags=interactive%2C2200-)：偶尔做做，了解一些解题套路。
- [博弈 2000+](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC&amp;tags=games%2C2000-)：也适合锻炼手玩。由于题目比较少，从 2000 开始筛选。

## 测试及对拍 Testing

编写一个 `run(io.Reader, io.Writer)` 函数来处理输入输出。这样写的理由是：

- 在 `main` 中调用 `run(os.Stdin, os.Stdout)` 来执行代码；
- 测试时，将测试数据转换成 `strings.Reader` 当作输入，并用一个 `strings.Builder` 来接收输出，将这二者传入 `run` 中，然后就能比较输出与答案了；
- 对拍时需要实现一个暴力算法 `runAC`，参数和 `run` 一样。通过 [随机数据生成器](/main/testutil/rand.go) 来生成数据，分别传入 `runAC` 和 `run`，通过比对各自的输出，来检查 `run` 中的问题。

具体可以见 Codeforces 代码仓库 [main](/main)，所有非交互题的代码及其对应测试全部按照上述框架实现。

例如：[1439C_test.go](/main/1400-1499/1439C_test.go)

交互题的写法要复杂一些，需要把涉及输入输出的地方抽象成接口，详见 [interactive_problem](/copypasta/template/interactive_problem)。

## Setup

### Binary programs

1. Download the pre-built program for your platform from the assets of a release in the [releases page](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/releases). You can alternatively download, build and install the latest version of the program by installing [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and then run `go install github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/cmd/ddns-updater@latest`.
1. For Linux and MacOS, make the program executable with `chmod +x ddns-updater`.
1. In the directory where the program is saved, create a directory `data`.
1. Write a JSON configuration in `data/config.json`, for example:

    ```json
    {
        &quot;settings&quot;: [
            {
                &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;namecheap&quot;,
                &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;sub.example.com&quot;,
                &quot;password&quot;: &quot;e5322165c1d74692bfa6d807100c0310&quot;
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    You can find more information in the [configuration section](#configuration) to customize it.
1. Run the program with `./ddns-updater` (`./ddns-updater.exe` on Windows) or by double-clicking on it.
1. The following is **optional**.
    - You can customize the program behavior using either [environment variables](#environment-variables) or flags. For flags, there is a flag corresponding to each environment variable, where it&#039;s all lowercase and underscores are replaced with dashes. For example the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` translates into `--log-level`.

### Container

[➡️ Qnap guide by @Araminta](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/issues/708)

1. Create a directory, for example, *data* which is:
    - owned by user id `1000`, which is the built-in user ID of the ddns-updater container
    - has user read+write+execute permissions

    ```sh
    mkdir data
    chown 1000 data
    chmod u+r+w+x data
    ```

    If you want to use another user ID, [build the image yourself](#build-the-image) with `--build-arg UID=&lt;your-uid&gt;`. You could also just run the container as root with `--user=&quot;0&quot;` but this is not advised security wise.

1. Similarly, create a *data/config.json* file which is:
    - owned by user id `1000`
    - has user read permissions

    ```sh
    touch data/config.json
    chmod u+r data/config.json
    ```

1. Edit *data/config.json*, for example:

    ```json
    {
        &quot;settings&quot;: [
            {
                &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;namecheap&quot;,
                &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;sub.example.com&quot;,
                &quot;password&quot;: &quot;e5322165c1d74692bfa6d807100c0310&quot;
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    You can find more information in the [configuration section](#configuration) to customize it.

1. Run the container with

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000/tcp -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/data:/updater/data qmcgaw/ddns-updater
    ```

1. The following is **optional**.
    - You can customize the program behavior using [environment variables](#environment-variables)
    - You can use [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) with `docker-compose up -d`
    - **Kubernetes**: check out the [k8s directory](k8s) for an installation guide and examples.
    - Other [Docker image tags are available](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/qmcgaw/ddns-updater/tags)
    - You can update the image with `docker pull qmcgaw/ddns-updater`
    - You can set your JSON configuration as a single environment variable line (i.e. `{&quot;settings&quot;: [{&quot;provider&quot;: &quot;namecheap&quot;, ...}]}`), which takes precedence over config.json. Note however that if you don&#039;t bind mount the `/updater/data` directory, there won&#039;t be a persistent database file `/updater/updates.json` but it will still work.

## Configuration

Start by having the following content in *config.json*, or in your `CONFIG` environment variable:

```json
{
    &quot;settings&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
        },
        {
            &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
        }
    ]
}
```

For each setting, you need to fill in parameters.

#### Public IP

By default, all public IP fetching types are used and cycled (over DNS and over HTTPs).

On top of that, for each fetching method, all echo services available are cycled on each request.

This allows you not to be blocked for making too many requests.

You can otherwise customize it with the following:

- `PUBLICIP_HTTP_PROVIDERS` gets your public IPv4 or IPv6 address. It can be one or more of the following:
  - `ipify` using [https://api64.ipify.org](https://api64.ipify.org)
  - `ifconfig` using [https://ifconfig.io/ip](https://ifconfig.io/ip)
  - `ipinfo` using [https://ipinfo.io/ip](https://ipinfo.io/ip)
  - `spdyn` using [https://checkip.spdyn.de](https://checkip.spdyn.de/)
  - `ipleak` using [https://ipleak.net/json](https://ipleak.net/json)
  - `icanhazip` using [https://icanhazip.com](https://icanhazip.com)
  - `ident` using [https://ident.me](https://ident.me)
  - `nnev` using [https://ip.nnev.de](https://ip.nnev.de)
  - `wtfismyip` using [https://wtfismyip.com/text](https://wtfismyip.com/text)
  - `seeip` using [https://api.seeip.org](https://api.seeip.org)
  - `changeip` using [https://ip.changeip.com](https://ip.changeip.com)
  - You can also specify an HTTPS URL with prefix `url:` for example `url:https://ipinfo.io/ip`
- `PUBLICIPV4_HTTP_PROVIDERS` gets your public IPv4 address only. It can be one or more of the following:
  - `ipleak` using [https://ipv4.ipleak.net/json](https://ipv4.ipleak.net/json)
  - `ipify` using [https://api.ipify.org](https://api.ipify.org)
  - `icanhazip` using [https://ipv4.icanhazip.com](https://ipv4.icanhazip.com)
  - `ident` using [https://v4.ident.me](https://v4.ident.me)
  - `nnev` using [https://ip4.nnev.de](https://ip4.nnev.de)
  - `wtfismyip` using [https://ipv4.wtfismyip.com/text](https://ipv4.wtfismyip.com/text)
  - `seeip` using [https://ipv4.seeip.org](https://ipv4.seeip.org)
  - You can also specify an HTTPS URL with prefix `url:` for example `url:https://ipinfo.io/ip`
- `PUBLICIPV6_HTTP_PROVIDERS` gets your public IPv6 address only. It can be one or more of the following:
  - `ipleak` using [https://ipv6.ipleak.net/json](https://ipv6.ipleak.net/json)
  - `ipify` using [https://api6.ipify.org](https://api6.ipify.org)
  - `icanhazip` using [https://ipv6.icanhazip.com](https://ipv6.icanhazip.com)
  - `ident` using [https://v6.ident.me](https://v6.ident.me)
  - `nnev` using [https://ip6.nnev.de](https://ip6.nnev.de)
  - `wtfismyip` using [https://ipv6.wtfismyip.com/text](https://ipv6.wtfismyip.com/text)
  - `seeip` using [https://ipv6.seeip.org](https://ipv6.seeip.org)
  - You can also specify an HTTPS URL with prefix `url:` for example `url:https://ipinfo.io/ip`
- `PUBLICIP_DNS_PROVIDERS` gets your public IPv4 address only or IPv6 address only or one of them (see #136). It can be one or more of the following:
  - `cloudflare`
  - `opendns`

### Host firewall

If you have a host firewall in place, this container needs the following ports:

- TCP 443 outbound for outbound HTTPS
- UDP 53 outbound for outbound DNS resolution
- TCP 8000 inbound (or other) for the WebUI

## Architecture

At program start and every period (5 minutes by default):

1. Fetch your public IP address
1. For each record:
    1. DNS resolve it to obtain its current IP address(es)
        - If the resolution fails, update the record with your public IP address by calling the DNS provider API and finish
    1. Check if your public IP address is within the resolved IP addresses
        - Yes: skip the update
        - No: update the record with your public IP address by calling the DNS provider API

💡 We do DNS resolution every period so it detects a change made to the record manually, for example on the DNS provider web UI
💡 As DNS resolutions are essentially free and without rate limiting, these are great to avoid getting banned for too many requests.

### Special case: Cloudflare

For Cloudflare records with the `proxied` option, the following is done.

At program start and every period (5 minutes by default), for each record:

1. Fetch your public IP address
1. For each record:
    1. Check the last IP address (persisted in `updates.json`) for that record
        - If it doesn&#039;t exist, update the record with your public IP address by calling the DNS provider API and finish
    1. Check if your public IP address matches the last IP address you updated the record with
        - Yes: skip the update
        - No: update the record with your public IP address by calling the DNS provider API

This is the only way as doing a DNS resolution on the record will give the IP address of a Cloudflare server instead of your server.

⚠️ This has the disadvantage that if the record is changed manually, the program will not detect it.
We could do an API call to get the record IP address every period, but that would get you banned especially with a low period duration.

## Testing

- The automated healthcheck verifies all your records are up to date [using DNS lookups](internal/health/check.go#L42)
- You can also manually check, by:
    1. Going to your DNS management webpage
    1. Setting your record to `127.0.0.1`
    1. Run the container
    1. Refresh the DNS management webpage and verify the update happened

## Build the image

You can build the image yourself with:

```sh
docker build -t qmcgaw/ddns-updater https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater.git
```

You can use optional build arguments with `--build-arg KEY=VALUE` from the table below:

| Build argument | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UID` | `1000` | User ID running the container |
| `GID` | `1000` | User group ID runni

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields based on tags.

It has the following **unique** features:

-   Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or custom validators.
-   Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a multidimensional field to be validated.
-   Ability to dive into both map keys and values for validation
-   Handles type interface by determining it&#039;s underlying type prior to validation.
-   Handles custom field types such as sql driver Valuer see [Valuer](https://golang.org/src/database/sql/driver/types.go?s=1210:1293#L29)
-   Alias validation tags, which allows for mapping of several validations to a single tag for easier defining of validations on structs
-   Extraction of custom defined Field Name e.g. can specify to extract the JSON name while validating and have it available in the resulting FieldError
-   Customizable i18n aware error messages.
-   Default validator for the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework; upgrading from v8 to v9 in gin see [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/master/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding)

A Call for Maintainers
----------------------

Please read the discussiong started [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/discussions/1330) if you are interested in contributing/helping maintain this package.

Installation
------------

Use go get.

	go get github.com/go-playground/validator/v10

Then import the validator package into your own code.

	import &quot;github.com/go-playground/validator/v10&quot;

Error Return Value
-------

Validation functions return type error

They return type error to avoid the issue discussed in the following, where err is always != nil:

* http://stackoverflow.com/a/29138676/3158232
* https://github.com/go-playground/validator/issues/134

Validator returns only InvalidValidationError for bad validation input, nil or ValidationErrors as type error; so, in your code all you need to do is check if the error returned is not nil, and if it&#039;s not check if error is InvalidValidationError ( if necessary, most of the time it isn&#039;t ) type cast it to type ValidationErrors like so:

```go
err := validate.Struct(mystruct)
validationErrors := err.(validator.ValidationErrors)
 ```

Usage and documentation
------

Please see https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 for detailed usage docs.

Baked-in Validations
------

### Special Notes:
- If new to using validator it is highly recommended to initialize it using the `WithRequiredStructEnabled` option which is opt-in to new behaviour that will become the default behaviour in v11+. See documentation for more details.
```go
validate := validator.New(validator.WithRequiredStructEnabled())
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># MCPHost 🤖

A CLI host application that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Currently supports both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Ollama models.

## Overview 🌟

MCPHost acts as a host in the MCP client-server architecture, where:
- **Hosts** (like MCPHost) are LLM applications that manage connections and interactions
- **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections with MCP servers
- **Servers** provide context, tools, and capabilities to the LLMs

This architecture allows language models to:
- Access external tools and data sources 🛠️
- Maintain consistent context across interactions 🔄
- Execute commands and retrieve information safely 🔒

Currently supports:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)
- Any Ollama-compatible model with function calling support

## Features ✨

- Interactive conversations with either Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Ollama models
- Support for multiple concurrent MCP servers
- Dynamic tool discovery and integration
- Tool calling capabilities for both model types
- Configurable MCP server locations and arguments
- Consistent command interface across model types
- Configurable message history window for context management

## Requirements 📋

- Go 1.23 or later
- For Claude: An Anthropic API key
- For Ollama: Local Ollama installation with desired models
- One or more MCP-compatible tool servers

## Environment Setup 🔧

1. Anthropic API Key (for Claude):
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&#039;your-api-key&#039;
```

2. Ollama Setup:
- Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
- Pull your desired model:
```bash
ollama pull mistral
```
- Ensure Ollama is running:
```bash
ollama serve
```

## Installation 📦

```bash
go install github.com/mark3labs/mcphost@latest
```

## Configuration ⚙️

MCPHost will automatically create a configuration file at `~/.mcp.json` if it doesn&#039;t exist. You can also specify a custom location using the `--config` flag:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;sqlite&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;uvx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;mcp-server-sqlite&quot;,
        &quot;--db-path&quot;,
        &quot;/tmp/foo.db&quot;
      ]
    },
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem&quot;,
        &quot;/tmp&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each MCP server entry requires:
- `command`: The command to run (e.g., `uvx`, `npx`) 
- `args`: Array of arguments for the command:
  - For SQLite server: `mcp-server-sqlite` with database path
  - For filesystem server: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` with directory path

## Usage 🚀

MCPHost is a CLI tool that allows you to interact with various AI models through a unified interface. It supports various tools through MCP servers.

### Available Models
Models can be specified using the `--model` (`-m`) flag:
- Anthropic Claude (default): `anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`
- OpenAI: `openai:gpt-4`
- Ollama models: `ollama:modelname`

### Examples
```bash
# Use Ollama with Qwen model
mcphost -m ollama:qwen2.5:3b

# Use OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4
mcphost -m openai:gpt-4
```

### Flags
- `--anthropic-url string`: Base URL for Anthropic API (defaults to api.anthropic.com)
- `--anthropic-api-key string`: Anthropic API key (can also be set via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable)
- `--config string`: Config file location (default is $HOME/mcp.json)
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging
- `--message-window int`: Number of messages to keep in context (default: 10)
- `-m, --model string`: Model to use (format: provider:model) (default &quot;anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest&quot;)
- `--openai-url string`: Base URL for OpenAI API (defaults to api.openai.com)
- `--openai-api-key string`: OpenAI API key (can also be set via OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable)


### Interactive Commands

While chatting, you can use:
- `/help`: Show available commands
- `/tools`: List all available tools
- `/servers`: List configured MCP servers
- `/history`: Display conversation history
- `/quit`: Exit the application
- `Ctrl+C`: Exit at any time

### Global Flags
- `--config`: Specify custom config file location
- `--message-window`: Set number of messages to keep in context (default: 10)
