# MCP Go SDK

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

This repository contains an implementation of the official Go software
development kit (SDK) for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Package / Feature documentation

The SDK consists of several importable packages:

- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp)
  package defines the primary APIs for constructing and using MCP clients and
  servers.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc) package is for users implementing
  their own transports.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth)
  package provides some primitives for supporting OAuth.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex)
  package provides extensions to the OAuth protocol, such as ProtectedResourceMetadata.

The SDK endeavors to implement the full MCP spec. The [`docs/`](/docs/) directory
contains feature documentation, mapping the MCP spec to the packages above.

## Getting started

To get started creating an MCP server, create an `mcp.Server` instance, add
features to it, and then run it over an `mcp.Transport`. For example, this
server adds a single simple tool, and then connects it to clients over
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

type Input struct {
	Name string `json:&quot;name&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the name of the person to greet&quot;`
}

type Output struct {
	Greeting string `json:&quot;greeting&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the greeting to tell to the user&quot;`
}

func SayHi(ctx context.Context, req *mcp.CallToolRequest, input Input) (
	*mcp.CallToolResult,
	Output,
	error,
) {
	return nil, Output{Greeting: &quot;Hi &quot; + input.Name}, nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a server with a single tool.
	server := mcp.NewServer(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;greeter&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)
	mcp.AddTool(server, &amp;mcp.Tool{Name: &quot;greet&quot;, Description: &quot;say hi&quot;}, SayHi)
	// Run the server over stdin/stdout, until the client disconnects.
	if err := server.Run(context.Background(), &amp;mcp.StdioTransport{}); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

To communicate with that server, create an `mcp.Client` and connect it to the
corresponding server, by running the server command and communicating over its
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;os/exec&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Create a new client, with no features.
	client := mcp.NewClient(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;mcp-client&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)

	// Connect to a server over stdin/stdout.
	transport := &amp;mcp.CommandTransport{Command: exec.Command(&quot;myserver&quot;)}
	session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	// Call a tool on the server.
	params := &amp;mcp.CallToolParams{
		Name:      &quot;greet&quot;,
		Arguments: map[string]any{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;you&quot;},
	}
	res, err := session.CallTool(ctx, params)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;CallTool failed: %v&quot;, err)
	}
	if res.IsError {
		log.Fatal(&quot;tool failed&quot;)
	}
	for _, c := range res.Content {
		log.Print(c.(*mcp.TextContent).Text)
	}
}
```

The [`examples/`](/examples/) directory contains more example clients and
servers.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the SDK! Please see See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details of how to contribute.

## Acknowledgements / Alternatives

Several third party Go MCP SDKs inspired the development and design of this
official SDK, and continue to be viable alternatives, notably
[mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go), originally authored by Ed Zynda.
We are grateful to Ed as well as the other contributors to mcp-go, and to
authors and contributors of other SDKs such as
[mcp-golang](https://github.com/metoro-io/mcp-golang) and
[go-mcp](https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp). Thanks to their work, there
is a thriving ecosystem of Go MCP clients and servers.

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Missing --help, --init. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 5.8. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | in progress | Mostly complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit not complete. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled. |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps. |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Some functionality (errors, hover, go to def, refs, sig help). More features coming soon. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.

Neko is also a great tool for **hosting watch parties** and interactive presentations. With its virtual browser capabilities, Neko allows you to host watch parties and presentations that are **accessible from anywhere**, without the need for in-person gatherings. This makes it easy to **stay connected with friends and colleagues**, even when you are unable to meet in person. With Neko, you can easily host a watch party or give an **interactive presentation**, whether it&#039;s for leisure or work. Simply invite your guests to join the virtual environment, and you can share the screen and **interact with them in real-time**.

## About

This app uses WebRTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and he was able to figure out the rest.

Then I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore and it got eventually archived.

## Use-cases and comparison

Neko started as a virtual browser that is streamed using WebRTC to multiple users.
- It is **not only limited to a browser**; it can run anything that runs on linux (e.g. VLC). Browser only happens to be the most popular and widely used use-case.
- In fact, it is not limited to a single program either; you can install a full desktop environment (e.g. XFCE, KDE).
- Speaking of limits, it does not need to run in a container; you could install neko on your host, connect to your X server and control your whole VM.
- Theoretically it is not limited to only X server, anything that can be controlled and scraped periodically for images could be used instead.
  - Like implementing RDP or VNC protocol, where neko would only act as WebRTC relay server. This is currently only future.

Primary use case is connecting with multiple people, leveraging real time synchronization and interactivity:
- **Watch party** - watching video content together with multiple people and reacting to it (chat, emotes) - open source alternative to [giggl.app](https://giggl.app/) or [hyperbeam](https://watch.hyperbeam.com).
- **Interactive presentation** - not only screen sharing, but others can control the screen.
- **Collaborative tool** - brainstorming ideas, cobrowsing, code debugging together.
- **Support/Teaching** - interactively guiding people in controlled environment.
- **Embed anything** - embed virtual browser in your web app - open source alternative to [hyperbeam API](https://hyperbeam.com/).
  - open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants.
  - request rooms using API with [neko-rooms](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-rooms).

Other use cases that benefit from single-user:
- **Personal workspace** - streaming containerized apps and desktops to end-users - similar to [kasm](https://www.kasmweb.com/).
- **Persistent browser** - own browser with persistent cookies available anywhere - similar to [mightyapp](https://www.mightyapp.com/).
  - no state is left on the host browser after terminating the connection.
  - sensitive data like cookies are not transferred - only video is shared.
- **Throwaway browser** - a better solution for planning secret parties and buying birthday gifts off the internet.
  - use Tor Browser and [VPN](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-vpn) for additional anonymity.
  - mitigates risk of OS fingerprinting and browser vulnerabilities by running in container.
- **Session broadcasting** - broadcast room content using RTMP (to e.g. twitch or youtube...).
- **Session recording** - broadcast RTMP can be saved to a file using e.g. [nginx-rtmp](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/modules/rtmp-media-streaming/)
  - have clean environment when recording tutorials.
  - no need to hide bookmarks or use incognito mode.
- **Jump host** - access your internal applications securely without the need for VPN.
- **Automated browser** - you can install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and automate tasks while being able to actively intercept them.

Compared to clientless remote desktop gateway (e.g. [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) or [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) with [noVNC](https://novnc.com/)), installed with remote desktop server along with desired program (e.g. [linuxserver/firefox](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-firefox)) provides neko additionally:
- **Smooth video** because it uses WebRTC and not images sent over WebSockets.
- **Built in audio** support, what is not part of Apache Guacamole or noVNC.
- **Multi-participant control**, what is not natively supported by Apache Guacamole or noVNC.

### Why neko?

I like cats 🐱 (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I&#039;m a weeb/nerd.

***But why the cat butt?*** Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyways.

  &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

# pgx - PostgreSQL Driver and Toolkit

pgx is a pure Go driver and toolkit for PostgreSQL.

The pgx driver is a low-level, high performance interface that exposes PostgreSQL-specific features such as `LISTEN` /
`NOTIFY` and `COPY`. It also includes an adapter for the standard `database/sql` interface.

The toolkit component is a related set of packages that implement PostgreSQL functionality such as parsing the wire protocol
and type mapping between PostgreSQL and Go. These underlying packages can be used to implement alternative drivers,
proxies, load balancers, logical replication clients, etc.

## Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;

	&quot;github.com/jackc/pgx/v5&quot;
)

func main() {
	// urlExample := &quot;postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name&quot;
	conn, err := pgx.Connect(context.Background(), os.Getenv(&quot;DATABASE_URL&quot;))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Unable to connect to database: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer conn.Close(context.Background())

	var name string
	var weight int64
	err = conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), &quot;select name, weight from widgets where id=$1&quot;, 42).Scan(&amp;name, &amp;weight)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;QueryRow failed: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	fmt.Println(name, weight)
}
```

See the [getting started guide](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/wiki/Getting-started-with-pgx) for more information.

## Features

* Automatic statement preparation and caching
* Batch queries
* Single-round trip query mode
* Full TLS connection control
* Binary format support for custom types (allows for much quicker encoding/decoding)
* `COPY` protocol support for faster bulk data loads
* Tracing and logging support
* Connection pool with after-connect hook for arbitrary connection setup
* `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY`
* Conversion of PostgreSQL arrays to Go slice mappings for integers, floats, and strings
* `hstore` support
* `json` and `jsonb` support
* Maps `inet` and `cidr` PostgreSQL types to `netip.Addr` and `netip.Prefix`
* Large object support
* NULL mapping to pointer to pointer
* Supports `database/sql.Scanner` and `database/sql/driver.Valuer` interfaces for custom types
* Notice response handling
* Simulated nested transactions with savepoints

## Choosing Between the pgx and database/sql Interfaces

The pgx interface is faster. Many PostgreSQL specific features such as `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` and `COPY` are not available
through the `database/sql` interface.

The pgx interface is recommended when:

1. The application only targets PostgreSQL.
2. No other libraries that require `database/sql` are in use.

It is also possible to use the `database/sql` interface and convert a connection to the lower-level pgx interface as needed.

## Testing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup instructions.

## Architecture

See the presentation at Golang Estonia, [PGX Top to Bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXMSWhcHCf8) for a description of pgx architecture.

## Supported Go and PostgreSQL Versions

pgx supports the same versions of Go and PostgreSQL that are supported by their respective teams. For [Go](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy) that is the two most recent major releases and for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) the major releases in the last 5 years. This means pgx supports Go 1.24 and higher and PostgreSQL 13 and higher. pgx also is tested against the latest version of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/).

## Version Policy

pgx follows semantic versioning for the documented public API on stable releases. `v5` is the latest stable major version.

## PGX Family Libraries

### [github.com/jackc/pglogrepl](https://github.com/jackc/pglogrepl)

pglogrepl provides functionality to act as a client for PostgreSQL logical replication.

### [github.com/jackc/pgmock](https://github.com/jackc/pgmock)

pgmock offers the ability to create a server that mocks the PostgreSQL wire protocol. This is used internally to test pgx by purposely inducing unusual errors. pgproto3 and pgmock together provide most of the foundational tooling required to implement a PostgreSQL proxy or MitM (such as for a custom connection pooler).

### [github.com/jackc/tern](https://github.com/jackc/tern)

tern is a stand-alone SQL migration system.

&lt;/p&gt;

**OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys. The OpenBao community intends to provide this software under an OSI-approved open-source license, led by a community run under open governance principles.**

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where OpenBao steps in.

The key features of OpenBao are:

* **Secure Secret Storage**: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored
  in OpenBao. OpenBao encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent
  storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn&#039;t enough to access
  your secrets. OpenBao can write to disk, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/),
  and more.

* **Dynamic Secrets**: OpenBao can generate secrets on-demand for some
  systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application
  needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks OpenBao for credentials, and OpenBao
  will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After
  creating these dynamic secrets, OpenBao will also automatically revoke them
  after the lease is up.

* **Data Encryption**: OpenBao can encrypt and decrypt data without storing
  it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and
  developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without
  having to design their own encryption methods.

* **Leasing and Renewal**: All secrets in OpenBao have a _lease_ associated
  with them. At the end of the lease, OpenBao will automatically revoke that
  secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.

* **Revocation**: OpenBao has built-in support for secret revocation. OpenBao
  can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example,
  all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.
  Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the
  case of an intrusion.

Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams
-------------------------------

Documentation is available on the [OpenBao website](https://www.openbao.org/docs/).

Developing OpenBao
--------------------

If you wish to work on OpenBao itself or any of its built-in systems, you&#039;ll
first need [Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.

For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a
[GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). Ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in
your path as some distributions bundle the old version of build tools. Next, clone this
repository. OpenBao uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules),
so it is recommended that you clone the repository ***outside*** of the GOPATH.
You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:

```sh
$ make bootstrap
...
```

To compile a development version of OpenBao, run `make` or `make dev`. This will
put the OpenBao binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make dev
...
$ bin/bao
...
```

To compile a development version of OpenBao with the UI, run `make static-dist dev-ui`. This will
put the OpenBao binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/bao
...
```

To run tests, type `make test`. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If
this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!

```sh
$ make test
...
```

If you&#039;re developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that
package by specifying the `TEST` variable. For example below, only
`vault` package tests will be run.

```sh
$ make test TEST=./vault
...
```

### Importing OpenBao

This repository publishes two libraries that may be imported by other projects:
`github.com/openbao/openbao/api/v2` and `github.com/openbao/openbao/sdk/v2`.

Note that this repository also contains OpenBao (the product), and as with most Go
projects, OpenBao uses Go modules to manage its dependencies. The mechanism to do
that is the [go.mod](./go.mod) file. As it happens, the presence of that file
also makes it theoretically possible to import OpenBao as a dependency into other
projects. Some other projects have made a practice of doing so in order to take
advantage of testing tooling that was developed for testing OpenBao itself. This
is not, and has never been, a supported way to use the OpenBao project. We aren&#039;t
likely to fix bugs relating to failure to import `github.com/openbao/openbao`
into your project.

See also the section &quot;Docker-based tests&quot; below.

### Acceptance Tests

OpenBao has comprehensive [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)
covering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.

If you&#039;re working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to
verify it is functioning (and also hasn&#039;t broken anything else), we recommend
running the acceptance tests.

**Warning:** The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify *real resources*, which
may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically
possible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,
please run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least,
we recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend
you&#039;re testing.

To run the acceptance tests, invoke `make testacc`:

```sh
$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/pki
...
```

The `TEST` variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the
backend is. The `TESTARGS` variable is recommended to filter down to a specific
resource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very
long time.

Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for
things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell
you what to set, so it is not documented here.

### Docker-based Tests

We have created an experimental new testing mechanism inspired by NewTestCluster.
An example of how to use it:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/openbao/openbao/sdk/v2/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;openbao/openbao&quot;,
    ImageTag:    &quot;latest&quot;,
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()

  client := cluster.Nodes()[0].APIClient()
  _, err := client.Logical().Read(&quot;sys/storage/raft/configuration&quot;)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Here is a more realistic example of how we use it in practice.  `DefaultOptions` uses
`hashicorp/vault:latest` as the repo and tag, but it also looks at the environment
variable `BAO_BINARY`. If populated, it will copy the local file referenced by
`BAO_BINARY` into the container. This is useful when testing local changes.

Optionally you can set `COMMIT_SHA`, which will be appended to the image name we
build as a debugging convenience.

```go
func Test_Custom_Build_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

Finally, here&#039;s an example of running an existing OSS docker test with a custom binary:

```bash
$ GOOS=linux make dev
$ VAULT_BINARY=$(pwd)/bin/bao go test -run &#039;TestRaft_Configuration_Docker&#039; ./vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary
ok      github.com/openbao/openbao/vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary        20.960s
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># OCI Image Format Specification

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/opencontainers/image-spec)
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/opencontainers/image-spec.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)

The OCI Image Format project creates and maintains the software shipping container image format spec (OCI Image Format).

**[The specification can be found here](spec.md).**

This repository also provides [Go types](specs-go), [intra-blob validation tooling, and JSON Schema](schema).
The Go types and validation should be compatible with the current Go release; earlier Go releases are not supported.

Additional documentation about how this group operates:

- [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]
- [Roadmap](#roadmap)
- [Releases](RELEASES.md)

## Running an OCI Image

The OCI Image Format partner project is the [OCI Runtime Spec project](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec).
The Runtime Specification outlines how to run a &quot;[filesystem bundle](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/bundle.md)&quot; that is unpacked on disk.
At a high-level an OCI implementation would download an OCI Image then unpack that image into an OCI Runtime filesystem bundle.
At this point the OCI Runtime Bundle would be run by an OCI Runtime.

This entire workflow supports the UX that users have come to expect from container engines like Docker and rkt: primarily, the ability to run an image with no additional arguments:

- docker run example.com/org/app:v1.0.0
- rkt run example.com/org/app,version=v1.0.0

To support this UX the OCI Image Format contains sufficient information to launch the application on the target platform (e.g. command, arguments, environment variables, etc).

## Distributing an OCI Image

The [OCI Distribution Spec Project](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/) defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content.
This API includes support for pushing and pulling OCI images to an OCI conformant registry.

## FAQ

**Q: What happens to AppC or Docker Image Formats?**

A: Existing formats can continue to be a proving ground for technologies, as needed.
The OCI Image Format project strives to provide a dependable open specification that can be shared between different tools and be evolved for years or decades of compatibility; as the deb and rpm format have.

Find more [FAQ on the OCI site](https://www.opencontainers.org/faq).

## Roadmap

The [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/milestones) lay out the path to the future improvements.

## Contributing

Development happens on GitHub for the spec.
Issues are used for bugs and actionable items and longer discussions can happen on the [mailing list](#mailing-list).

The specification and code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license found in the `LICENSE` file of this repository.

### Discuss your design

The project welcomes submissions, but please let everyone know what you are working on.

Before undertaking a nontrivial change to this specification, send mail to the [mailing list](#mailing-list) to discuss what you plan to do.
This gives everyone a chance to validate the design, helps prevent duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits.
It also guarantees that the design is sound before code is written; a GitHub pull-request is not the place for high-level discussions.

Typos and grammatical errors can go straight to a pull-request.
When in doubt, start on the [mailing-list](#mailing-list).

### Meetings

Please see the [OCI org repository README](https://github.com/opencontainers/org#meetings) for the most up-to-date information on OCI contributor and maintainer meeting schedules.
You can also find links to meeting agendas and minutes for all prior meetings.

### Mailing List

You can subscribe and join the mailing list on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!forum/dev).

### Markdown style

To keep consistency throughout the Markdown files in the Open Container spec all files should be formatted one sentence per line.
This fixes two things: it makes diffing easier with git and it resolves fights about line wrapping length.
For example, this paragraph will span three lines in the Markdown source.

### Git commit

#### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Joe Smith &lt;joe@gmail.com&gt;
```

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

You can add the sign off when creating the git commit via `git commit -s`.

### Commit Style

Simple house-keeping for clean git history.
Read more on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) or the Discussion section of [`git-commit(1)`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).

1. Separate the subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
   - If there was important/useful/essential conversation or information, copy or include a reference
8. When possible, one keyword to scope the change in the subject (i.e. &quot;README: ...&quot;, &quot;runtime: ...&quot;)

## K9s - Kubernetes CLI To Manage Your Clusters In Style!

K9s provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters.
The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage
your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes
for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.

---

## Note...

K9s is not pimped out by a big corporation with deep pockets.
It is a complex OSS project that demands a lot of my time to maintain and support.
K9s will always remain OSS and therefore free! That said, if you feel k9s makes your day to day Kubernetes journey a tad brighter, saves you time and makes you more productive, please consider [sponsoring us!](https://github.com/sponsors/derailed)
Your donations will go a long way in keeping our servers lights on and beers in our fridge!

**Thank you!**

## Building From Source

 K9s is currently using GO v1.23.X or above.
 In order to build K9s from source you must:

 1. Clone the repo
 2. Build and run the executable

      ```shell
      make build &amp;&amp; ./execs/k9s
      ```

---

## Running with Docker

### Running the official Docker image

  You can run k9s as a Docker container by mounting your `KUBECONFIG`:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v $KUBECONFIG:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s
  ```

  For default path it would be:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s
  ```

### Building your own Docker image

  You can build your own Docker image of k9s from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with the following:

  ```shell
  docker build -t k9s-docker:v0.0.1 .
  ```

  You can get the latest stable `kubectl` version and pass it to the `docker build` command with the `--build-arg` option.
  You can use the `--build-arg` option to pass any valid `kubectl` version (like `v1.18.0` or `v1.19.1`).

  ```shell
  KUBECTL_VERSION=$(make kubectl-stable-version 2&gt;/dev/null)
  docker build --build-arg KUBECTL_VERSION=${KUBECTL_VERSION} -t k9s-docker:0.1 .
  ```

  Run your container:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config k9s-docker:0.1
  ```

---

## PreFlight Checks

* K9s uses 256 colors terminal mode. On `Nix system make sure TERM is set accordingly.

    ```shell
    export TERM=xterm-256color
    ```

* In order to issue resource edit commands make sure your EDITOR and KUBE_EDITOR env vars are set.

    ```shell
    # Kubectl edit command will use this env var.
    export KUBE_EDITOR=my_fav_editor
    ```

* K9s prefers recent kubernetes versions ie 1.28+

```

### View K9s logs

```shell
tail -f /Users/fernand/.local/data/k9s/k9s.log
```

### Start K9s in debug mode

```shell
k9s -l debug
```

### Customize logs destination

You can override the default log file destination either with the `--logFile` argument:

```shell
k9s --logFile /tmp/k9s.log
less /tmp/k9s.log
```

Or through the `K9S_LOGS_DIR` environment variable:

```shell
K9S_LOGS_DIR=/var/log k9s
less /var/log/k9s.log
```

## Key Bindings

K9s uses aliases to navigate most K8s resources.

## K9s Configuration

  K9s keeps its configurations as YAML files inside of a `k9s` directory and the location depends on your operating system. K9s leverages [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) to load its various configurations files. For information on the default locations for your OS please see [this link](https://github.com/adrg/xdg/blob/master/README.md). If you are still confused a quick `k9s info` will reveal where k9s is loading its configurations from. Alternatively, you can set `K9S_CONFIG_DIR` to tell K9s the directory location to pull its configurations from.

  | Unix            | macOS                              | Windows               |
  |-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
  | `~/.config/k9s` | `~/Library/Application Support/k9s` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\k9s`  |

  &gt; NOTE: This is still in flux and will change while in pre-release stage!

You can now override the context portForward default address configuration by setting an env variable that can override all clusters portForward local address using `K9S_DEFAULT_PF_ADDRESS=a.b.c.d`

  ```yaml
  # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml

## Quickstart

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]  
&gt; The following steps are meant for quick local setup and evaluation.  
&gt; When using the default **in-memory storage engine**, data is ephemeral and will be discarded once the service stops.
&gt;
&gt; For [details on configuring](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga) storage 
&gt; backends, tuning performance, and deploying OpenFGA securely in production-ready environments, refer to the 
&gt; documentation: [Running in Production](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/running-in-production).


Run OpenFGA with in-memory storage (⚠️ **not for production**):

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 openfga/openfga run
```

Once running, create a store:

```shell
curl -X POST &#039;localhost:8080/stores&#039; \
  --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data-raw &#039;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;openfga-demo&quot;}&#039;
```

## Installation

### Docker

OpenFGA is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openfga/openfga), so you can quickly start it using the
in-memory datastore by running the following commands:

```shell
docker pull openfga/openfga
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 openfga/openfga run
```

### Docker Compose

[`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yaml) provides an example of how to launch OpenFGA with Postgres using `docker compose`.

```shell
curl -LO https://openfga.dev/docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up
```

### Homebrew

If you are a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) user, you can install [OpenFGA](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openfga) with the following command:

```shell
brew install openfga
```

### Precompiled Binaries

Download your platform&#039;s [latest release](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/latest) and extract it.
Then run the binary with the command:

```shell
./openfga run
```

### Build from Source

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Make sure you have the latest version of Go installed. See the [Go downloads](https://go.dev/dl/) page.

#### `go install`

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOBIN) # make sure $GOBIN is on your $PATH
go install github.com/openfga/openfga/cmd/openfga
openfga run
```

#### `go build`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openfga/openfga.git &amp;&amp; cd openfga
go build -o ./openfga ./cmd/openfga
./openfga run
```

### Verify Installation

Now that you have [installed](#installation) OpenFGA, you can test your installation by [creating an OpenFGA Store](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/create-store).

```shell
curl -X POST &#039;localhost:8080/stores&#039; \
  --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data-raw &#039;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;openfga-demo&quot;}&#039;
```

If everything is running correctly, you should get a response with information about the newly created store, for example:

```json
{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;01G3EMTKQRKJ93PFVDA1SJHWD2&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;openfga-demo&quot;,
  &quot;created_at&quot;: &quot;2022-05-19T17:11:12.888680Z&quot;,
  &quot;updated_at&quot;: &quot;2022-05-19T17:11:12.888680Z&quot;
}
```

## Playground

The Playground lets you model, visualize, and test authorization setups.
By default, it’s available at: [http://localhost:3000/playground](http://localhost:3000/playground)

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; The Playground is intended for **local development only**.  
&gt; It can currently only be configured to connect to an OpenFGA server running on `localhost`.

Disable it with:

```shell
./openfga run --playground-enabled=false
```

Change port:

```shell
./openfga run --playground-enabled --playground-port 3001
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; The `OPENFGA_HTTP_ADDR` environment variable can be used to configure the address at which the Playground expects the OpenFGA server to be.
&gt;
&gt; For example:
&gt;
&gt; ```shell
&gt; docker run -e OPENFGA_PLAYGROUND_ENABLED=true \
&gt; -e OPENFGA_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:4000 \
&gt; -p 4000:4000 -p 3000:3000 openfga/openfga run
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; This starts OpenFGA on port 4000 and configures the Playground accordingly.

## Next Steps

Take a look at examples of how to:

- [Write an Authorization Model](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/WriteAuthorizationModel)
- [Write Relationship Tuples](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/Write)
- [Perform Authorization Checks](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check)
- [Add Authentication to your OpenFGA server](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/docker#configuring-authentication)

📚 Explore the [Documentation](https://openfga.dev/) and [API Reference](https://openfga.dev/api/service).

## Limitations

### MySQL Storage engine

The MySQL storage engine has stricter length limits on tuple properties than other backends. See [docs](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/docker#configuring-data-storage).

💡 OpenFGA’s MySQL adapter was contributed by @twintag — thank you!

## Production Readiness

- ✅ Used in production by [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fine-grained-authorization) since December 2021
- ⚠️ Memory storage adapter is **for development only**
- 🗄 Supported storage: PostgreSQL 14+, MySQL 8, SQLite (beta)
- 📘 See [Running in Production](https://openfga.dev/docs/best-practices/running-in-production)

The OpenFGA team treats **production-impacting issues with highest priority**.

See organizations using OpenFGA in production: [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/openfga/community/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).
If your organization is using OpenFGA, please consider adding it to the list.

# What is Rook?

Rook is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator** for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for Ceph storage to natively integrate with Kubernetes.

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is a distributed storage system that provides file, block and object storage and is deployed in large scale production clusters.

Rook automates deployment and management of Ceph to provide self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services.
The Rook operator does this by building on Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph.

The status of the Ceph storage provider is **Stable**. Features and improvements will be planned for many future versions. Upgrades between versions are provided to ensure backward compatibility between releases.

Rook is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a [graduated](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/) level project. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who&#039;s involved and how Rook plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/01/29/cncf-host-rook-project-cloud-native-storage-capabilities).

[![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci-runs] [![Go Reference][reference-badge]][reference]

gomock is a mocking framework for the [Go programming language][golang]. It
integrates well with Go&#039;s built-in `testing` package, but can be used in other
contexts too.

This project originates from Google&#039;s `golang/mock` repo. Unfortunately, Google
no longer maintains this project, and given the heavy usage of gomock project
within Uber, we&#039;ve decided to fork and maintain this going forward at Uber.

[Contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome in the form of GitHub issue or PR!

## Supported Go Versions

go.uber.org/mock supports all Go versions supported by the official
[Go Release Policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). That is,
the two most recent releases of Go.

## Installation

Install the `mockgen` tool.

```
go install go.uber.org/mock/mockgen@latest
```

To ensure it was installed correctly, use:

```
mockgen -version
```

If that fails, make sure your GOPATH/bin is in your PATH. You can add it with:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

## Running mockgen

`mockgen` has three modes of operation: archive, source and package.

### Archive mode

Archive mode generates mock interfaces from a package archive
file (.a). It is enabled by using the -archive flag. An import
path and a comma-separated list of symbols should be provided
as a non-flag argument to the command.

Example:

```bash
# Build the package to a archive.
go build -o pkg.a database/sql/driver

mockgen -archive=pkg.a database/sql/driver Conn,Driver
```

### Source mode

Source mode generates mock interfaces from a source file.
It is enabled by using the -source flag. Other flags that
may be useful in this mode are -imports and -aux_files.

Example:

```bash
mockgen -source=foo.go [other options]
```

### Package mode

Package mode works by specifying the package and interface names.
It is enabled by passing two non-flag arguments: an import path, and a
comma-separated list of symbols.

You can use &quot;.&quot; to refer to the current path&#039;s package.

Example:

```bash
mockgen database/sql/driver Conn,Driver

# Convenient for `go:generate`.
mockgen . Conn,Driver
```

### Flags

The `mockgen` command is used to generate source code for a mock
class given a Go source file containing interfaces to be mocked.
It supports the following flags:

- `-archive`: A package archive file containing interfaces to be mocked.

- `-source`: A file containing interfaces to be mocked.

- `-destination`: A file to which to write the resulting source code. If you
  don&#039;t set this, the code is printed to standard output.

- `-package`: The package to use for the resulting mock class
  source code. If you don&#039;t set this, the package name is `mock_` concatenated
  with the package of the input file.

- `-imports`: A list of explicit imports that should be used in the resulting
  source code, specified as a comma-separated list of elements of the form
  `foo=bar/baz`, where `bar/baz` is the package being imported and `foo` is
  the identifier to use for the package in the generated source code.

- `-aux_files`: A list of additional files that should be consulted to
  resolve e.g. embedded interfaces defined in a different file. This is
  specified as a comma-separated list of elements of the form
  `foo=bar/baz.go`, where `bar/baz.go` is the source file and `foo` is the
  package name of that file used by the -source file.

- `-build_flags`: (package mode only) Flags passed verbatim to `go list`.

- `-mock_names`: A list of custom names for generated mocks. This is specified
  as a comma-separated list of elements of the form
  `Repository=MockSensorRepository,Endpoint=MockSensorEndpoint`, where
  `Repository` is the interface name and `MockSensorRepository` is the desired
  mock name (mock factory method and mock recorder will be named after the mock).
  If one of the interfaces has no custom name specified, then default naming
  convention will be used.

- `-self_package`: The full package import path for the generated code. The
  purpose of this flag is to prevent import cycles in the generated code by
  trying to include its own package. This can happen if the mock&#039;s package is
  set to one of its inputs (usually the main one) and the output is stdio so
  mockgen cannot detect the final output package. Setting this flag will then
  tell mockgen which import to exclude.

- `-copyright_file`: Copyright file used to add copyright header to the resulting source code.

- `-debug_parser`: Print out parser results only.

- `-write_package_comment`: Writes package documentation comment (godoc) if true. (default true)

- `-write_generate_directive`: Add //go:generate directive to regenerate the mock. (default false)

- `-write_source_comment`: Writes original file (source mode) or interface names (package mode) comment if true. (default true)

- `-typed`: Generate Type-safe &#039;Return&#039;, &#039;Do&#039;, &#039;DoAndReturn&#039; function. (default false)

- `-exclude_interfaces`: Comma-separated names of interfaces to be excluded

For an example of the use of `mockgen`, see the `sample/` directory. In simple
cases, you will need only the `-source` flag.

## Building Mocks

```go
type Foo interface {
  Bar(x int) int
}

func SUT(f Foo) {
 // ...
}

```

```go
func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
  ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)

  m := NewMockFoo(ctrl)

  // Asserts that the first and only call to Bar() is passed 99.
  // Anything else will fail.
  m.
    EXPECT().
    Bar(gomock.Eq(99)).
    Return(101)

  SUT(m)
}
```

## Building Stubs

```go
type Foo interface {
  Bar(x int) int
}

func SUT(f Foo) {
 // ...
}

```

```go
func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
  ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)

  m := NewMockFoo(ctrl)

  // Does not make any assertions. Executes the anonymous functions and returns
  // its result when Bar is invoked with 99.
  m.
    EXPECT().
    Bar(gomock.Eq(99)).
    DoAndReturn(func(_ int) int {
      time.Sleep(1*time.Second)
      return 101
    }).
    AnyTimes()

  // Does not make any assertions. Returns 103 when Bar is invoked with 101.
  m.
    EXPECT().
    Bar(gomock.Eq(101)).
    Return(103).
    AnyTimes()

  SUT(m)
}
```

## Modifying Failure Messages

When a matcher reports a failure, it prints the received (`Got`) vs the
expected (`Want`) value.

```shell
Got: [3]
Want: is equal to 2
Expected call at user_test.go:33 doesn&#039;t match the argument at index 1.
Got: [0 1 1 2 3]
Want: is equal to 1
```

### Modifying `Want`

The `Want` value comes from the matcher&#039;s `String()` method. If the matcher&#039;s
default output doesn&#039;t meet your needs, then it can be modified as follows:

```go
gomock.WantFormatter(
  gomock.StringerFunc(func() string { return &quot;is equal to fifteen&quot; }),
  gomock.Eq(15),
)
```

This modifies the `gomock.Eq(15)` matcher&#039;s output for `Want:` from `is equal
to 15` to `is equal to fifteen`.

### Modifying `Got`

The `Got` value comes from the object&#039;s `String()` method if it is available.
In some cases the output of an object is difficult to read (e.g., `[]byte`) and
it would be helpful for the test to print it differently. The following
modifies how the `Got` value is formatted:

```go
gomock.GotFormatterAdapter(
  gomock.GotFormatterFunc(func(i any) string {
    // Leading 0s
    return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%02d&quot;, i)
  }),
  gomock.Eq(15),
)
```

If the received value is `3`, then it will be printed as `03`.

# What is TruffleHog 🐽

TruffleHog is the most powerful secrets **Discovery, Classification, Validation,** and **Analysis** tool. In this context, secret refers to a credential a machine uses to authenticate itself to another machine. This includes API keys, database passwords, private encryption keys, and more...

## Discovery 🔍

TruffleHog can look for secrets in many places including Git, chats, wikis, logs, API testing platforms, object stores, filesystems and more

## Classification 📁

TruffleHog classifies over 800 secret types, mapping them back to the specific identity they belong to. Is it an AWS secret? Stripe secret? Cloudflare secret? Postgres password? SSL Private key? Sometimes it&#039;s hard to tell looking at it, so TruffleHog classifies everything it finds.

## Validation ✅

For every secret TruffleHog can classify, it can also log in to confirm if that secret is live or not. This step is critical to know if there’s an active present danger or not.

## Analysis 🔬

For the 20 some of the most commonly leaked out credential types, instead of sending one request to check if the secret can log in, TruffleHog can send many requests to learn everything there is to know about the secret. Who created it? What resources can it access? What permissions does it have on those resources?

curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin &lt;ReleaseTag like v3.56.0&gt;
```

# :closed_lock_with_key: Verifying the artifacts

Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.

You need the following tool to verify signature:

- [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)

Verification steps are as follows:

1. Download the artifact files you want, and the following files from the [releases](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/releases) page.

   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt
   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt.pem
   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt.sig

2. Verify the signature:

   ```shell
   cosign verify-blob &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt&gt; \
   --certificate &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.pem&gt; \
   --signature &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.sig&gt; \
   --certificate-identity-regexp &#039;https://github\.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/\.github/workflows/.+&#039; \
   --certificate-oidc-issuer &quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot;
   ```

3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:

   ```shell
   sha256sum --ignore-missing -c trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt
   ```

Replace `{version}` with the downloaded files version

Alternatively, if you are using the installation script, pass `-v` option to perform signature verification.
This requires Cosign binary to be installed prior to running the installation script.

trufflehog docker --image file://path_to_image.tar --results=verified
```

## 12: Scan in CI

Set the `--since-commit` flag to your default branch that people merge into (ex: &quot;main&quot;). Set the `--branch` flag to your PR&#039;s branch name (ex: &quot;feature-1&quot;). Depending on the CI/CD platform you use, this value can be pulled in dynamically (ex: [CIRCLE_BRANCH in Circle CI](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/) and [TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH in Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/)). If the repo is cloned and the target branch is already checked out during the CI/CD workflow, then `--branch HEAD` should be sufficient. The `--fail` flag will return an 183 error code if valid credentials are found.

```bash
trufflehog git file://. --since-commit main --branch feature-1 --results=verified,unknown --fail
```

## 13: Scan a Postman workspace

Use the `--workspace-id`, `--collection-id`, `--environment` flags multiple times to scan multiple targets.

```bash
trufflehog postman --token=&lt;postman api token&gt; --workspace-id=&lt;workspace id&gt;
```

## 14: Scan a Jenkins server

```bash
trufflehog jenkins --url https://jenkins.example.com --username admin --password admin
```

## 15: Scan an Elasticsearch server

### Scan a Local Cluster

There are two ways to authenticate to a local cluster with TruffleHog: (1) username and password, (2) service token.

#### Connect to a local cluster with username and password

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --username truffle --password hog
```

#### Connect to a local cluster with a service token

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --service-token ‘AAEWVaWM...Rva2VuaSDZ’
```

### Scan an Elastic Cloud Cluster

To scan a cluster on Elastic Cloud, you’ll need a Cloud ID and API key.

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch \
  --cloud-id &#039;search-prod:dXMtY2Vx...YjM1ODNlOWFiZGRlNjI0NA==&#039; \
  --api-key &#039;MlVtVjBZ...ZSYlduYnF1djh3NG5FQQ==&#039;
```

## 16. Scan a GitHub Repository for Cross Fork Object References and Deleted Commits

The following command will enumerate deleted and hidden commits on a GitHub repository and then scan them for secrets. This is an alpha release feature.

```bash
trufflehog github-experimental --repo https://github.com/&lt;USER&gt;/&lt;REPO&gt;.git --object-discovery
```

In addition to the normal TruffleHog output, the `--object-discovery` flag creates two files in a new `$HOME/.trufflehog` directory: `valid_hidden.txt` and `invalid.txt`. These are used to track state during commit enumeration, as well as to provide users with a complete list of all hidden and deleted commits (`valid_hidden.txt`). If you&#039;d like to automatically remove these files after scanning, please add the flag `--delete-cached-data`.

**Note**: Enumerating all valid commits on a repository using this method takes between 20 minutes and a few hours, depending on the size of your repository. We added a progress bar to keep you updated on how long the enumeration will take. The actual secret scanning runs extremely fast.

For more information on Cross Fork Object References, please [read our blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github).

## 17. Scan Hugging Face

### Scan a Hugging Face Model, Dataset or Space

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --model &lt;model_id&gt; --space &lt;space_id&gt; --dataset &lt;dataset_id&gt;
```

### Scan all Models, Datasets and Spaces belonging to a Hugging Face Organization or User

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --org &lt;orgname&gt; --user &lt;username&gt;
```

(Optionally) When scanning an organization or user, you can skip an entire class of resources with `--skip-models`, `--skip-datasets`, `--skip-spaces` OR a particular resource with `--ignore-models &lt;model_id&gt;`, `--ignore-datasets &lt;dataset_id&gt;`, `--ignore-spaces &lt;space_id&gt;`.

### Scan Discussion and PR Comments

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --model &lt;model_id&gt; --include-discussions --include-prs
```

## 18. Scan stdin Input

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://example/gzipped/data.gz - | gunzip -c | trufflehog stdin
```

# :question: FAQ

- All I see is `🐷🔑🐷  TruffleHog. Unearth your secrets. 🐷🔑🐷` and the program exits, what gives?
  - That means no secrets were detected
- Why is the scan taking a long time when I scan a GitHub org
  - Unauthenticated GitHub scans have rate limits. To improve your rate limits, include the `--token` flag with a personal access token
- It says a private key was verified, what does that mean?
  - A verified result means TruffleHog confirmed the credential is valid by testing it against the service&#039;s API. For private keys, we&#039;ve confirmed the key can be used live for SSH or SSL authentication. Check out our Driftwood blog post to learn more [Blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood-know-if-private-keys-are-sensitive/)
- Is there an easy way to ignore specific secrets?
  - If the scanned source [supports line numbers](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/d6375ba92172fd830abb4247cca15e3176448c5d/pkg/engine/engine.go#L358-L365), then you can add a `trufflehog:ignore` comment on the line containing the secret to ignore that secrets.

# :newspaper: What&#039;s new in v3?

TruffleHog v3 is a complete rewrite in Go with many new powerful features.

- We&#039;ve **added over 700 credential detectors that support active verification against their respective APIs**.
- We&#039;ve also added native **support for scanning GitHub, GitLab, Docker, filesystems, S3, GCS, Circle CI and Travis CI**.
- **Instantly verify private keys** against millions of github users and **billions** of TLS certificates using our [Driftwood](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood) technology.
- Scan binaries, documents, and other file formats
- Available as a GitHub Action and a pre-commit hook

## What is credential verification?

For every potential credential that is detected, we&#039;ve painstakingly implemented programmatic verification against the API that we think it belongs to. Verification eliminates false positives and provides three result statuses:

- **verified**: Credential confirmed as valid and active by API testing
- **unverified**: Credential detected but not confirmed valid (may be invalid, expired, or verification disabled)  
- **unknown**: Verification attempted but failed due to errors, such as a network or API failure

For example, the [AWS credential detector](pkg/detectors/aws/aws.go) performs a `GetCallerIdentity` API call against the AWS API to verify if an AWS credential is active.

# :memo: Usage

TruffleHog has a sub-command for each source of data that you may want to scan:

- git
- github
- gitlab
- docker
- s3
- filesystem (files and directories)
- syslog
- circleci
- travisci
- gcs (Google Cloud Storage)

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.

## Getting Started &amp; Documentation

Documentation is available on the [Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform):

- [Introduction](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)
- [Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs)

If you&#039;re new to Terraform and want to get started creating infrastructure, please check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#getting-started) on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#operations-and-development) to continue your learning.

Show off your Terraform knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the [certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/) for information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/certification/terraform-associate) on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform.

## Developing Terraform

This repository contains only Terraform core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine. Providers are implemented as plugins, and Terraform can automatically download providers that are published on [the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io). HashiCorp develops some providers, and others are developed by other organizations. For more information, refer to [Plugin development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin).

# NVIDIA GPU Operator

![nvidia-gpu-operator](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/egx/nvidia-egx-platform-gold-image-full-2c50-d@2x.jpg)

Kubernetes provides access to special hardware resources such as NVIDIA GPUs, NICs, Infiniband adapters and other devices through the [device plugin framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/). However, configuring and managing nodes with these hardware resources requires configuration of multiple software components such as drivers, container runtimes or other libraries which  are difficult and prone to errors.
The NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the [operator framework](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/introducing-the-operator-framework) within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision GPU. These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Runtime, automatic node labelling, [DCGM](https://developer.nvidia.com/dcgm) based monitoring and others.

## Audience and Use-Cases
The GPU Operator allows administrators of Kubernetes clusters to manage GPU nodes just like CPU nodes in the cluster. Instead of provisioning a special OS image for GPU nodes, administrators can rely on a standard OS image for both CPU and GPU nodes and then rely on the GPU Operator to provision the required software components for GPUs.

Note that the GPU Operator is specifically useful for scenarios where the Kubernetes cluster needs to scale quickly - for example provisioning additional GPU nodes on the cloud or on-prem and managing the lifecycle of the underlying software components. Since the GPU Operator runs everything as containers including NVIDIA drivers, the administrators can easily swap various components - simply by starting or stopping containers.

# Overview

Cobra is a library providing a simple interface to create powerful modern CLI
interfaces similar to git &amp; go tools.

Cobra provides:
* Easy subcommand-based CLIs: `app server`, `app fetch`, etc.
* Fully POSIX-compliant flags (including short &amp; long versions)
* Nested subcommands
* Global, local and cascading flags
* Intelligent suggestions (`app srver`... did you mean `app server`?)
* Automatic help generation for commands and flags
* Grouping help for subcommands
* Automatic help flag recognition of `-h`, `--help`, etc.
* Automatically generated shell autocomplete for your application (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
* Automatically generated man pages for your application
* Command aliases so you can change things without breaking them
* The flexibility to define your own help, usage, etc.
* Optional seamless integration with [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for 12-factor apps

# Concepts

Cobra is built on a structure of commands, arguments &amp; flags.

**Commands** represent actions, **Args** are things and **Flags** are modifiers for those actions.

The best applications read like sentences when used, and as a result, users
intuitively know how to interact with them.

The pattern to follow is
`APPNAME VERB NOUN --ADJECTIVE`
    or
`APPNAME COMMAND ARG --FLAG`.

A few good real world examples may better illustrate this point.

In the following example, &#039;server&#039; is a command, and &#039;port&#039; is a flag:

    hugo server --port=1313

In this command we are telling Git to clone the url bare.

    git clone URL --bare

## Commands

Command is the central point of the application. Each interaction that
the application supports will be contained in a Command. A command can
have children commands and optionally run an action.

In the example above, &#039;server&#039; is the command.

## Flags

A flag is a way to modify the behavior of a command. Cobra supports
fully POSIX-compliant flags as well as the Go [flag package](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/).
A Cobra command can define flags that persist through to children commands
and flags that are only available to that command.

In the example above, &#039;port&#039; is the flag.

Flag functionality is provided by the [pflag
library](https://github.com/spf13/pflag), a fork of the flag standard library
which maintains the same interface while adding POSIX compliance.

# Installing
Using Cobra is easy. First, use `go get` to install the latest version
of the library.

```
go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra@latest
```

Next, include Cobra in your application:

```go
import &quot;github.com/spf13/cobra&quot;
```

# Usage
`cobra-cli` is a command line program to generate cobra applications and command files.
It will bootstrap your application scaffolding to rapidly
develop a Cobra-based application. It is the easiest way to incorporate Cobra into your application.

It can be installed by running:

```
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

For complete details on using the Cobra-CLI generator, please read [The Cobra Generator README](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/blob/main/README.md)

For complete details on using the Cobra library, please read [The Cobra User Guide](site/content/user_guide.md).

## What is Optimism?

[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) is a project dedicated to scaling Ethereum&#039;s technology and expanding its ability to coordinate people from across the world to build effective decentralized economies and governance systems. The [Optimism Collective](https://www.optimism.io/vision) builds open-source software that powers scalable blockchains and aims to address key governance and economic challenges in the wider Ethereum ecosystem. Optimism operates on the principle of **impact=profit**, the idea that individuals who positively impact the Collective should be proportionally rewarded with profit. **Change the incentives and you change the world.**

In this repository you&#039;ll find numerous core components of the OP Stack, the decentralized software stack maintained by the Optimism Collective that powers Optimism and forms the backbone of blockchains like [OP Mainnet](https://explorer.optimism.io/) and [Base](https://base.org). The OP Stack is designed to be aggressively open-source — you are welcome to explore, modify, and extend this code.

## Documentation

- If you want to build on top of OP Mainnet, refer to the [Optimism Documentation](https://docs.optimism.io)
- If you want to build your own OP Stack based blockchain, refer to the [OP Stack Guide](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started) and make sure to understand this repository&#039;s [Development and Release Process](#development-and-release-process)

## Specification

Detailed specifications for the OP Stack can be found within the [OP Stack Specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) repository.

## Community

General discussion happens most frequently on the [Optimism discord](https://discord.gg/optimism).
Governance discussion can also be found on the [Optimism Governance Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/).

## Contributing

The OP Stack is a collaborative project. By collaborating on free, open software and shared standards, the Optimism Collective aims to prevent siloed software development and rapidly accelerate the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. Come contribute, build the future, and redefine power, together.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) contains a detailed explanation of the contributing process for this repository. Make sure to use the [Developer Quick Start](./CONTRIBUTING.md#development-quick-start) to properly set up your development environment.

## Development and Release Process

### Overview

Please read this section carefully if you&#039;re planning to fork or make frequent PRs into this repository.

### Production Releases

Production releases are always tags, versioned as `&lt;component-name&gt;/v&lt;semver&gt;`.
For example, an `op-node` release might be versioned as `op-node/v1.1.2`, and  smart contract releases might be versioned as `op-contracts/v1.0.0`.
Release candidates are versioned in the format `op-node/v1.1.2-rc.1`.
We always start with `rc.1` rather than `rc`.

For contract releases, refer to the GitHub release notes for a given release which will list the specific contracts being released. Not all contracts are considered production ready within a release and many are under active development.

Tags of the form `v&lt;semver&gt;`, such as `v1.1.4`, indicate releases of all Go code only, and **DO NOT** include smart contracts.
This naming scheme is required by Golang.
In the above list, this means these `v&lt;semver&gt;` releases contain all `op-*` components and exclude all `contracts-*` components.

`op-geth` embeds upstream geth’s version inside its own version as follows: `vMAJOR.GETH_MAJOR GETH_MINOR GETH_PATCH.PATCH`.
Basically, geth’s version is our minor version.
For example if geth is at `v1.12.0`, the corresponding op-geth version would be `v1.101200.0`.
Note that we pad out to three characters for the geth minor version and two characters for the geth patch version.
Since we cannot left-pad with zeroes, the geth major version is not padded.

See the [Node Software Releases](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/releases) page of the documentation for more information about releases for the latest node components.

The full set of components that have releases are:

- `op-batcher`
- `op-contracts`
- `op-challenger`
- `op-node`
- `op-proposer`

All other components and packages should be considered development components only and do not have releases.

### Development branch

The primary development branch is [`develop`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/).
`develop` contains the most up-to-date software that remains backwards compatible with the latest experimental [network deployments](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/networks).
If you&#039;re making a backwards compatible change, please direct your pull request towards `develop`.

**Changes to contracts within `packages/contracts-bedrock/src` are usually NOT considered backwards compatible.**
Some exceptions to this rule exist for cases in which we absolutely must deploy some new contract after a tag has already been fully deployed.
If you&#039;re changing or adding a contract and you&#039;re unsure about which branch to make a PR into, default to using a feature branch.
Feature branches are typically used when there are conflicts between 2 projects touching the same code, to avoid conflicts from merging both into `develop`.

# Vitess 

Vitess is a cloud-native horizontally-scalable distributed database system that is built around MySQL.
Vitess can achieve unlimited scaling through generalized sharding.

Vitess allows application code and database queries to remain agnostic to the distribution of data onto
multiple database servers. With Vitess, you can even split and merge shards as your needs
grow, with an atomic cutover step that takes only a few seconds.

Vitess was a core component of YouTube&#039;s database infrastructure
from 2011, and grew to encompass tens of thousands of MySQL nodes. 
Starting in 2015, Vitess was adopted by many other large companies, including Slack, Square (now Block), and JD.com.

# batt

[![Go Checks](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/actions/workflows/gochecks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/actions/workflows/gochecks.yml)[![Buind Test Binary](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/actions/workflows/build-test-binary.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/actions/workflows/build-test-binary.yml)

`batt` is a tool to control battery charging on Apple Silicon MacBooks.

## Why do you need this?

[This article](https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries) might be helpful. TL;DR: keep your battery at 80% or lower when plugged in, and discharge it as shallowly as feasible.

Previously, before optimized battery charging is introduced, MacBooks are known to suffer from battery swelling when they are kept at 100% all the time, especially the 2015s. Even with optimized battery charging, the effect is not optimal (described [below](#but-macos-have-similar-features-built-in-is-it)).

`batt` can effectively alleviate this problem by limiting the battery charge level. It can be used to set a maximum charge level. For example, you can set it to 80%, and it will stop charging when the battery reaches 80%. Once it reaches the predefined level, your computer will use power from the wall _only_, leaving no strain on your battery.

Quick link to [installation guide](#installation).

## Features

`batt` tried to keep as simple as possible. Charging limiting is the only thing to care about for most users:

- Limit battery charge, with a lower and upper bound, like ThinkPads. [Docs](#limit-battery-charge)

However, if you are nerdy and want to dive into the details, it does have some advanced features for the computer nerds out there :)

- Control MagSafe LED (if present) according to charge status. [Docs](#control-magsafe-led)
- Cut power from the wall (even if the adapter is physically plugged in) to use battery power. [Docs](#enabledisable-power-adapter)
- It solves common sleep-related issues when controlling charging. [Docs1](#preventing-idle-sleep) [Docs2](#disabling-charging-before-sleep)

## How is it different from XXX?

**It is free and opensource**. It even comes with some features (like idle sleep preventions and pre-sleep stop charging) that are only available in paid counterparts. It comes with no ads, no tracking, no telemetry, no analytics, no bullshit. It is open source, so you can read the code and verify that it does what it says it does.

**It is simple but well-thought.** It only does charge limiting and does it well. For example, when using other free/unpaid tools, your MacBook will sometimes charge to 100% during sleep even if you set the limit to, like, 60%. `batt` have taken these edge cases into consideration and will behave as intended (in case you do encounter problems, please raise an issue so that we can solve it). Other features is intentionally limited to keep it simple. If you want some additional features, feel free to raise an issue, then we can discuss.

**It is light-weight.** As a command-line tool, it is light-weight by design. No electron GUIs hogging your system resources. However, a native GUI that sits in the menubar is a good addition.

## But macOS have similar features built-in, is it?

Yes, macOS have optimized battery charging. It will try to find out your charging and working schedule and prohibits charging above 80% for a couple of hours overnight. However, if you have an un-regular schedule, this will simply not work. Also, you lose predictability (which I value a lot) about your computer&#039;s behavior, i.e., by letting macOS decide for you, you, the one who knows your schedule the best, cannot control when to charge or when not to charge.

`batt` can make sure your computer does exactly what you want. You can set a maximum charge level, and it will stop charging when the battery reaches that level. Therefore, it is recommended to disable macOS&#039;s optimized charging when using `batt`.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Firmware Version        | GUI | CLI (Prebuilt) | CLI (Build from Source) |

- ❌: Unsupported
- ✅: Supported
- ⚠️: Partially supported, more tests are needed to verify the compatibility. Read [#34](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/issues/34) for details.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Firmware version is different from macOS version. You can check your firmware version by running `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep -i firmware` in Terminal.

If you want to know which MacBooks I personally developed it on, I am using it on all my personal MacBooks every single day, including MacBook Air M1 2020 (A2337), MacBook Air M2 2022 (A2681), MacBook Pro 14&#039; M1 Pro 2021 (A2442), MacBook Pro 16&#039; M1 Max 2021 (A2485).

If you encounter any incompatibility, please raise an issue with your MacBook model and macOS version.

## Installation (GUI Version)

GUI version is a native macOS menubar app. It&#039;s not as feature-complete as the command-line version, but it is a good choice if you are not comfortable with the command-line. The command-line version is also included if you have the GUI version.

1. Download `.dmg` file from [Releases](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/releases) and open it (right-click open if macOS says it&#039;s damaged)
2. Drag `batt.app` to `Applications`
3. macOS may say it&#039;s damaged when you try to run it (it&#039;s NOT) and wants you to move it to trash. To fix it, run this in Terminal: `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/batt.app`.
4. Run `batt.app`.
5. Follow the MenuBar UI to install or upgrade.
6. It is _highly_ recommended to disable macOS&#039;s optimized charging when using `batt`. To do so, open `System Settings` -&gt; `Battery` -&gt; `Battery Health` -&gt; `i` -&gt; Turn OFF `Optimized Battery Charging`

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; There are 3rd-party GUI versions built around `batt` by some amazing opensource developers:
&gt; 1. [BattGUI](https://github.com/clzoc/BattGUI) by [@clzoc](https://github.com/clzoc)


## Installation (Command-Line Version)

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Command-Line version is already included if you have installed the GUI version. You can run `batt` in Terminal to use it.

You have two choices to install the CLI version of `batt`:

1. Homebrew (If you prefer a package manager) [Docs](#homebrew)
2. Installation Script (Recommended) [Docs](#installation-script)

You can choose either one. Please do not use both at the same time to avoid conflicts.

### Homebrew

1. `brew install batt`
2. `sudo brew services start batt`
3. Please read [Notes](#notes).

&gt; Thank you, [@Jerry1144](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/issues/9#issuecomment-2165493285), for bootstrapping the Homebrew formula.

### Installation Script

1. (Optional) There is an installation script to help you quickly install batt (Internet connection required). Put this in your terminal: `bash &lt;(curl -fsSL https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/raw/master/hack/install.sh)`. You may need to provide your login password (to control charging). This will download and install the latest _stable_ version for you. Follow the on-screen instructions, then you can skip to step 5.
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Manual installation steps&lt;/summary&gt;

2. Get the binary. For _stable_ and _beta_ releases, you can find the download link in the [release page](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/releases). If you want development versions with the latest features and bug fixes, you can download prebuilt binaries from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/actions/workflows/build-test-binary.yml) (has a retention period of 3 months and you need to `chmod +x batt` after extracting the archive) or [build it yourself](#building) .
3. Put the binary somewhere safe. You don&#039;t want to move it after installation :). It is recommended to save it in your `$PATH`, e.g., `/usr/local/bin`, so you can directly call `batt` on the command-line. In this case, the binary location will be `/usr/local/bin/batt`.
4. Install daemon using `sudo batt install`. If you do not want to use `sudo` every time after installation, add the `--allow-non-root-access` flag: `sudo batt install --allow-non-root-access`. To uninstall: please refer to [How to uninstall?](#how-to-uninstall)
&lt;/details&gt;

5. In case you have GateKeeper turned on, you will see something like _&quot;batt is can&#039;t be opened because it was not downloaded from the App Store&quot;_ or _&quot;batt cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified&quot;_. If you don&#039;t see it, you can skip this step. To solve this, you can either 1. (recommended) Go to *System Settings* -&gt; *Privacy &amp; Security* --scroll-down--&gt; *Security* -&gt; *Open Anyway*; or 2. run `sudo spctl --master-disable` to disable GateKeeper entirely.

### Notes

- Test if it works by running `sudo batt status`. If you see your battery status, you are good to go!
- Time to customize. By default `batt` will set a charge limit to 60%. For example, to set the charge limit to 80%, run `sudo batt limit 80`.
- As said before, it is _highly_ recommended to disable macOS&#039;s optimized charging when using `batt`. To do so, open `System Settings` -&gt; `Battery` -&gt; `Battery Health` -&gt; `i` -&gt; Turn OFF `Optimized Battery Charging`
- If your current charge is above the limit, your computer will just stop charging and use power from the wall. It will stay at your current charge level, which is by design. You can use your battery until it is below the limit to see the effects.
- You can refer to [Usage](#usage) for additional configurations. Don&#039;t know what a command does? Run `batt help` to see all available commands. To see help for a specific command, run `batt help &lt;command&gt;`.
- To disable the charge limit, run `batt disable` or `batt limit 100`.
- [How to uninstall?](#how-to-uninstall) [How to upgrade?](#how-to-upgrade)

&gt; Finally, if you find `batt` helpful, stars ⭐️ are much appreciated!

## Usage

### Limit battery charge

Make sure your computer doesn&#039;t charge beyond what you said.

Setting the limit to 10-99 will enable the battery charge limit, limiting the maximum charge to _somewhere around_ your setting. However, setting the limit to 100 will disable the battery charge limit.

By default, `batt` will set a 60% charge limit.

To customize charge limit, see `batt limit`. For example,to set the limit to 80%, run `batt limit 80`. To disable the limit, run `batt disable` or `batt limit 100`.

### Enable/disable power adapter

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This feature is CLI-only and is not available in the GUI version.

Cut or restore power from the wall. This has the same effect as unplugging/plugging the power adapter, even if the adapter is physically plugged in.

This is useful when you want to use your battery to lower the battery charge, but you don&#039;t want to unplug the power adapter.

NOTE: if you are using Clamshell mode (using a Mac laptop with an external monitor and the lid closed), *cutting power will cause your Mac to go to sleep*. This is a limitation of macOS. There are ways to prevent this, but it is not recommended for most users.

To enable/disable power adapter, see `batt adapter`. For example, to disable the power adapter, run `sudo batt adapter disable`. To enable the power adapter, run `sudo batt adapter enable`.

### Check status

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This feature is CLI-only and is not available in the GUI version.

Check the current config, battery info, and charging status.

To do so, run `sudo batt status`.

## Advanced

These advanced features are not for most users. Using the default setting for these options should work the best.

### Preventing idle sleep

Set whether to prevent idle sleep during a charging session.

Due to macOS limitations, `batt` will be paused when your computer goes to sleep. As a result, when you are in a charging session and your computer goes to sleep, there is no way for batt to stop charging (since batt is paused by macOS) and the battery will charge to 100%. This option, together with disable-charging-pre-sleep, will prevent this from happening.

This option tells macOS NOT to go to sleep when the computer is in a charging session, so batt can continue to work until charging is finished. Note that it will only prevent **idle** sleep, when 1) charging is active 2) battery charge limit is enabled. So your computer can go to sleep as soon as a charging session is completed.

However, this options does not prevent manual sleep (limitation of macOS). For example, if you manually put your computer to sleep (by choosing the Sleep option in the top-left Apple menu) or close the lid, batt will still be paused and the issue mentioned above will still happen. This is where disable-charging-pre-sleep comes in. See [Disabling charging before sleep](#disabling-charging-before-sleep).

To enable this feature, run `sudo batt prevent-idle-sleep enable`. To disable, run `sudo batt prevent-idle-sleep disable`.

### Disabling charging before sleep

Set whether to disable charging before sleep if charge limit is enabled.

As described in [Preventing idle sleep](#preventing-idle-sleep), batt will be paused by macOS when your computer goes to sleep, and there is no way for batt to continue controlling battery charging. This option will disable charging just before sleep, so your computer will not overcharge during sleep, even if the battery charge is below the limit.

To enable this feature, run `sudo batt disable-charging-pre-sleep enable`. To disable, run `sudo batt disable-charging-pre-sleep disable`.

### Prevent system sleep

Set whether to prevent system sleep during a charging session (experimental).

This option tells macOS to create power assertion, which prevents sleep, when all conditions are met:

1) charging is active
2) battery charge limit is enabled
3) computer is connected to charger.

So your computer can go to sleep as soon as a charging session is completed / charger disconnected.

Does similar thing to [Preventing idle sleep](#preventing-idle-sleep), but works for manual sleep too.

*Note*: Please disable [Preventing idle sleep](#preventing-idle-sleep) and [Disabling charging before sleep](#disabling-charging-before-sleep), while this feature is in use.

To enable this feature, run `sudo batt prevent-system-sleep enable`. To disable, run `sudo batt prevent-system-sleep disable`.

### Upper and lower charge limit

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This feature is CLI-only and is not available in the GUI version.

When you set a charge limit, for example, on a Lenovo ThinkPad, you can set two percentages. The first one is the upper limit, and the second one is the lower limit. When the battery charge is above the upper limit, the computer will stop charging. When the battery charge is below the lower limit, the computer will start charging. If the battery charge is between the two limits, the computer will keep whatever charging state it is in.

`batt` have similar features built-in. The charge limit you have set (using `batt limit`) will be used as the upper limit. By default, The lower limit will be set to 2% less than the upper limit. To customize the lower limit, use `batt lower-limit-delta`.

For example, if you want to set the lower limit to be 5% less than the upper limit, run `sudo batt lower-limit-delta 5`. So, if you have your charge (upper) limit set to 60%, the lower limit will be 55%.

### Control MagSafe LED

&gt; Acknowledgement: [@exidler](https://github.com/exidler)

This option makes the MagSafe LED reflect the charging state of your MacBook (or force it off).

- Green: charge limit is reached and charging is stopped.
- Orange: charging is in progress.
- Off: just woken up from sleep, charing is disabled and batt is waiting before controlling charging.

Note that you must have a MagSafe LED on your MacBook to use this feature.

To enable MagSafe LED control, run `sudo batt magsafe-led enable`.

To force the MagSafe LED to stay off, run `sudo batt magsafe-led always-off`.

### Check logs

Logs are directed to `/tmp/batt.log`. If something goes wrong, you can check the logs to see what happened. Raise an issue with the logs attached, so we can debug together.

## Building

You need to install command line developer tools (by running `xcode-select --install`) and Go (follow the official instructions [here](https://go.dev/doc/install)).

### CLI

```shell
make
```

Simply running `make` in this repo should build the binary into `./bin/batt`. You can then follow [the upgrade guide](#how-to-upgrade) to install it (you just use the binary you have built, not downloading a new one, of course).

### GUI

```shell
make app
```

This will build the GUI version of `batt` into `./bin/batt.app`. Drag it to `/Applications` and run it.

## Architecture

You can think of `batt` like `docker`. It has a daemon that runs in the background, and a client (CLI or GUI) that communicates with the daemon. They communicate through unix domain socket as a way of IPC. The daemon does the actual heavy-lifting, and is responsible for controlling battery charging. The client is responsible for sending users&#039; requirements to the daemon.

For example, when you run `sudo batt limit 80`, the client will send the requirement to the daemon, and the daemon will do its job to keep the charge limit to 80%.

## Motivation

I created this tool simply because I am not satisfied with existing tools 😐.

I have written and using similar utils (to limit charging) on Intel MacBooks for years. Finally I got hands on an Apple Silicon MacBook (yes, 2 years later since it is introduced 😅 and I just got my first one). The old BCLM way to limit charging doesn&#039;t work anymore. I was looking for a tool to limit charging on M1 MacBooks.

I have tried some alternatives, both closed source and open source, but I kept none of them. Some paid alternatives&#039; licensing options are just too limited 🤔, a bit bloated, require periodic Internet connection (hmm?) and are closed source. It doesn&#039;t seem a good option for me. Some open source alternatives just don&#039;t handle edge cases well and I encountered issues regularly especially when sleeping (as of Apr 2023).

I want a _simple_ tool that does just one thing, and **does it well** -- limiting charging, just like the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). It seems I don&#039;t have any options but to develop by myself. So I spent a weekend developing an MVP, so here we are! `batt` is here!

## FAQ

### How to uninstall?

#### GUI version

Click `Uninstall Daemon...` to uninstall. After the daemon is uninstalled, you can remove the `batt.app` from your `Applications` folder.

#### CLI version

Note that you should choose the same method as you used to install `batt` to uninstall it.

If you don&#039;t remember how you installed it, you can check the binary location by running `which batt`. If it is in `/usr/local/bin`, you probably used the installation script. If it is in `/opt/homebrew/bin`, you probably used Homebrew.
