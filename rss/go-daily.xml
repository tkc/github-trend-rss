## Why Kaiju?
The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at around 5,400 FPS on the same machine. In fact, a complete game, with audio, custom cursors, real time PBR rendering with real time shadows, UI, and more runs at 2,712 FPS (in &quot;debug&quot; mode) [screenshots or it didn&#039;t happen](https://x.com/ShieldCrush/status/1943516032674537958).

## Why Go (golang)?
I love C, and because I love C and found out that Ken Thompson played a part in designing Go, I gave Go a chance. It has been such a joy to use and work with I decided to port my C game engine to Go. Go is a modern system-level language that allows me to write code the way I want to write code and even have the opportunity to do some crazy things if I want to (no strings attached). Also the simplicity and &quot;just works&quot; of writing Assembly code was a great boost to my happiness.

What&#039;s more, it&#039;s a language that other developers can easily learn and jump right into extending the engine/editor. No need for developers to re-figure out some bespoke macros or crazy templating nonsense. It&#039;s flat, easy, straight forward, and the foot-gun is hidden behind some walls, but there if you want it. Furthermore, developers can write their games in Go directly, no need for some alternative language that is different from the engine code (but we&#039;ll include Lua for modding).

## What about the Garbage Collector?!
I am creating this section because I get asked about it when I mention &quot;Go&quot;, possibly not realizing that most public game engines use a garbage collector (GC).

The GC is actually a feature I&#039;m happy with (shocker coming from a C guy). Well, the reason is simple, if you&#039;re going to make a game engine that the public will use and needs to be stable, you need a garbage collector. Unity has C# (and possibly an internal GC as well), Unreal has a GC (and it could use a tune up if you ask me), Godot has a GC albeit their scripting language or when you use C#. It is actually very important for public engines to have a GC because people are only human and make a lot of mistakes, mistakes they&#039;ll blame on you (the engine developer) before they blame themselves.

Coincidentally, the overall design I have for the engine plays very well with the GC and last I measured, I have a net-0 heap allocation while running (may need a new review). If you don&#039;t abuse the GC, you shouldn&#039;t generally feel it, it runs concurrently as well.

I&#039;ll be the first to admit, I think the developers of Go can create a better GC than I can, and probably better than Unreal and Unity too.

## ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️
Though the engine is production ready, the editor **_is not_**, feel free to join and contribute to its development.

## Overview

The Prometheus Operator provides [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) native deployment and management of
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and related monitoring components. The purpose of this project is to
simplify and automate the configuration of a Prometheus based monitoring stack for Kubernetes clusters.

The Prometheus operator includes, but is not limited to, the following features:

* **Kubernetes Custom Resources**: Use Kubernetes custom resources to deploy and manage Prometheus, Alertmanager,
  and related components.

* **Simplified Deployment Configuration**: Configure the fundamentals of Prometheus like versions, persistence,
  retention policies, and replicas from a native Kubernetes resource.

* **Prometheus Target Configuration**: Automatically generate monitoring target configurations based
  on familiar Kubernetes label queries; no need to learn a Prometheus specific configuration language.

For an introduction to the Prometheus Operator, see the [getting started](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/developer/getting-started.md) guide.

## Project Status

The operator in itself is considered to be production ready. Please refer to the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) versions for the status of each CRD:

* `monitoring.coreos.com/v1`: **stable** CRDs and API, changes are made in a backward-compatible way.
* `monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1`: **unstable** CRDs and API, changes can happen but the team is focused on avoiding them. We encourage usage in production for users that accept the risk of breaking changes.
* `monitoring.coreos.com/v1alpha1`: **unstable** CRDs and API, changes can happen frequently, and we suggest avoiding its usage on mission-critical environments.

## Prometheus Operator vs. kube-prometheus vs. community Helm chart

### Prometheus Operator

The Prometheus Operator uses Kubernetes [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) to simplify the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related monitoring components.

### kube-prometheus

[kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) provides example configurations for a complete cluster monitoring
stack based on Prometheus and the Prometheus Operator. This includes deployment of multiple Prometheus and Alertmanager instances,
metrics exporters such as the node_exporter for gathering node metrics, scrape target configuration linking Prometheus to various
metrics endpoints, and example alerting rules for notification of potential issues in the cluster.

### Helm chart

The [prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
Helm chart provides a similar feature set to kube-prometheus. This chart is maintained by the Prometheus community.
For more information, please see the [chart&#039;s readme](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack#kube-prometheus-stack)

## Prerequisites

The Prometheus Operator requires at least Kubernetes version `1.16.0`. If you
are just starting out with the Prometheus Operator, it is highly recommended to
use the latest [stable
release](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/releases/latest).

## CustomResourceDefinitions

A core feature of the Prometheus Operator is to monitor the Kubernetes API server for changes
to specific objects and ensure that the current Prometheus deployments match these objects.
The Operator acts on the following [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/):

* **`Prometheus`**, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment.

* **`PrometheusAgent`**, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment, but running in Agent mode.

* **`Alertmanager`**, which defines a desired Alertmanager deployment.

* **`ThanosRuler`**, which defines a desired Thanos Ruler deployment.

* **`ServiceMonitor`**, which declaratively specifies how groups of Kubernetes services should be monitored.
  The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.

* **`PodMonitor`**, which declaratively specifies how group of pods should be monitored.
  The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.

* **`Probe`**, which declaratively specifies how groups
  of ingresses or static targets should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration
  based on the definition.

* **`ScrapeConfig`**, which declaratively specifies scrape configurations to be added to Prometheus. This CustomResourceDefinition helps with scraping resources outside the Kubernetes cluster.

* **`PrometheusRule`**, which defines a desired set of Prometheus alerting and/or recording rules.
  The Operator generates a rule file, which can be used by Prometheus instances.

* **`AlertmanagerConfig`**, which declaratively specifies subsections of the Alertmanager configuration, allowing
  routing of alerts to custom receivers, and setting inhibit rules.

The Prometheus operator automatically detects changes in the Kubernetes API server to any of the above objects, and ensures that
matching deployments and configurations are kept in sync.

To learn more about the CRDs introduced by the Prometheus Operator have a look
at the [design](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/getting-started/design/) page.

## Dynamic Admission Control

To prevent invalid Prometheus alerting and recording rules from causing failures in a deployed Prometheus instance,
an [admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/)
is provided to validate `PrometheusRule` resources upon initial creation or update.

For more information on this feature, see the [user guide](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/platform/webhook/).

## Quickstart

**Note:** this quickstart does not provision an entire monitoring stack; if that is what you are looking for,
see the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) project. If you want the whole stack,
but have already applied the `bundle.yaml`, delete the bundle first (`kubectl delete -f bundle.yaml`).

To quickly try out *just* the Prometheus Operator inside a cluster, **choose a release** and run the following command which deploys the operator in the `default` namespace:

```sh
kubectl create -f bundle.yaml
```

If you want to deploy the Prometheus operator in a different namespace, you also need `kustomize`:

```sh
NAMESPACE=my_namespace kustomize edit set namespace $NAMESPACE &amp;&amp; kubectl create -k .
```

&gt; Note: make sure to adapt the namespace in the ClusterRoleBinding if deploying in a namespace other than the default namespace.

To run the Operator outside of a cluster:

```sh
make
scripts/run-external.sh &lt;kubectl cluster name&gt;
```

## Removal

To remove the operator and Prometheus, first delete any custom resources you created in each namespace. The
operator will automatically shut down and remove Prometheus and Alertmanager pods, and associated ConfigMaps.

```sh
for n in $(kubectl get namespaces -o jsonpath={..metadata.name}); do
  kubectl delete --all --namespace=$n prometheus,servicemonitor,podmonitor,alertmanager
done
```

After a couple of minutes you can go ahead and remove the operator itself.

```sh
kubectl delete -f bundle.yaml
```

The operator automatically creates services in each namespace where you created a Prometheus or Alertmanager resources,
and defines three custom resource definitions. You can clean these up now.

```sh
for n in $(kubectl get namespaces -o jsonpath={..metadata.name}); do
  kubectl delete --ignore-not-found --namespace=$n service prometheus-operated alertmanager-operated
done

kubectl delete --ignore-not-found customresourcedefinitions \
  prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com \
  servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com \
  podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com \
  alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com \
  prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com \
  alertmanagerconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com \
  scrapeconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com
```

## Quick start

:information_source: For Kubernetes deployments, see [`examples/kubernetes`](./examples/kubernetes).

BuildKit is composed of the `buildkitd` daemon and the `buildctl` client.
While the `buildctl` client is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, the `buildkitd` daemon is only available for Linux and *Windows currently.

The latest binaries of BuildKit are available [here](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases) for Linux, macOS, and Windows.


### Linux Setup

The `buildkitd` daemon requires the following components to be installed:
-   [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) or [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun)
-   [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) (if you want to use containerd worker)

**Starting the `buildkitd` daemon:**
You need to run `buildkitd` as the root user on the host.

```bash
$ sudo buildkitd
```

To run `buildkitd` as a non-root user, see [`docs/rootless.md`](docs/rootless.md).

The buildkitd daemon supports two worker backends: OCI (runc) and containerd.

By default, the OCI (runc) worker is used. You can set `--oci-worker=false --containerd-worker=true` to use the containerd worker.

We are open to adding more backends.

To start the buildkitd daemon using systemd socket activation, you can install the buildkit systemd unit files.
See [Systemd socket activation](#systemd-socket-activation)

The buildkitd daemon listens gRPC API on `/run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock` by default, but you can also use TCP sockets.
See [Expose BuildKit as a TCP service](#expose-buildkit-as-a-tcp-service).

### Windows Setup

See instructions and notes at [`docs/windows.md`](./docs/windows.md).

### macOS Setup

[Homebrew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/buildkit) (unofficial) is available for macOS.
```console
$ brew install buildkit
```

The Homebrew formula does not contain the daemon (`buildkitd`).

For example, [Lima](https://lima-vm.io) can be used for launching the daemon inside a Linux VM.
```console
brew install lima
limactl start template://buildkit
export BUILDKIT_HOST=&quot;unix://$HOME/.lima/buildkit/sock/buildkitd.sock&quot;
```

### Build from source

To build BuildKit from source, see [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For a `buildctl` reference, see [this document](./docs/reference/buildctl.md).

### Exploring LLB

BuildKit builds are based on a binary intermediate format called LLB that is used for defining the dependency graph for processes running part of your build. tl;dr: LLB is to Dockerfile what LLVM IR is to C.

-   Marshaled as Protobuf messages
-   Concurrently executable
-   Efficiently cacheable
-   Vendor-neutral (i.e. non-Dockerfile languages can be easily implemented)

See [`solver/pb/ops.proto`](./solver/pb/ops.proto) for the format definition, and see [`./examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md) for example LLB applications.

Currently, the following high-level languages have been implemented for LLB:

-   Dockerfile (See [Exploring Dockerfiles](#exploring-dockerfiles))
-   [Buildpacks](https://github.com/tonistiigi/buildkit-pack)
-   [Mockerfile](https://matt-rickard.com/building-a-new-dockerfile-frontend/)

-   (open a PR to add your own language)

### Exploring Dockerfiles

Frontends are components that run inside BuildKit and convert any build definition to LLB. There is a special frontend called gateway (`gateway.v0`) that allows using any image as a frontend.

During development, Dockerfile frontend (`dockerfile.v0`) is also part of the BuildKit repo. In the future, this will be moved out, and Dockerfiles can be built using an external image.

#### Building a Dockerfile with `buildctl`

```bash
buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=.
# or
buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=. \
    --opt target=foo \
    --opt build-arg:foo=bar
```

`--local` exposes local source files from client to the builder. `context` and `dockerfile` are the names Dockerfile frontend looks for build context and Dockerfile location.

If the Dockerfile has a different filename it can be specified with `--opt filename=./Dockerfile-alternative`.

#### Building a Dockerfile using external frontend

External versions of the Dockerfile frontend are pushed to https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/dockerfile-upstream and https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/dockerfile and can be used with the gateway frontend. The source for the external frontend is currently located in `./frontend/dockerfile/cmd/dockerfile-frontend` but will move out of this repository in the future ([#163](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/163)). For automatic build from master branch of this repository `docker/dockerfile-upstream:master` or `docker/dockerfile-upstream:master-labs` image can be used.

```bash
buildctl build \
    --frontend gateway.v0 \
    --opt source=docker/dockerfile \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=.
buildctl build \
    --frontend gateway.v0 \
    --opt source=docker/dockerfile \
    --opt context=https://github.com/moby/moby.git \
    --opt build-arg:APT_MIRROR=cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org
```

### Output

By default, the build result and intermediate cache will only remain internally in BuildKit. An output needs to be specified to retrieve the result.

#### Image/Registry

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true
```

To export the image to multiple registries:

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=image,\&quot;name=docker.io/username/image,docker.io/username2/image2\&quot;,push=true
```

To export the cache embed with the image and pushing them to registry together, type `registry` is required to import the cache, you should specify `--export-cache type=inline` and `--import-cache type=registry,ref=...`. To export the cache to a local directly, you should specify `--export-cache type=local`.
Details in [Export cache](#export-cache).

```bash
buildctl build ...\
  --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true \
  --export-cache type=inline \
  --import-cache type=registry,ref=docker.io/username/image
```

Keys supported by image output:
* `name=&lt;value&gt;`: specify image name(s)
* `push=true`: push after creating the image
* `push-by-digest=true`: push unnamed image
* `registry.insecure=true`: push to insecure HTTP registry
* `oci-mediatypes=true`: use OCI mediatypes in configuration JSON instead of Docker&#039;s
* `oci-artifact=false`: use OCI artifact format for attestations
* `unpack=true`: unpack image after creation (for use with containerd)
* `dangling-name-prefix=&lt;value&gt;`: name image with `prefix@&lt;digest&gt;`, used for anonymous images
* `name-canonical=true`: add additional canonical name `name@&lt;digest&gt;`
* `compression=&lt;uncompressed|gzip|estargz|zstd&gt;`: choose compression type for layers newly created and cached, gzip is default value. estargz should be used with `oci-mediatypes=true`.
* `compression-level=&lt;value&gt;`: compression level for gzip, estargz (0-9) and zstd (0-22)
* `rewrite-timestamp=true`: rewrite the file timestamps to the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` value.
   See [`docs/build-repro.md`](docs/build-repro.md) for how to specify the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` value.
* `force-compression=true`: forcefully apply `compression` option to all layers (including already existing layers)
* `store=true`: store the result images to the worker&#039;s (e.g. containerd) image store as well as ensures that the image has all blobs in the content store (default `true`). Ignored if the worker doesn&#039;t have image store (e.g. OCI worker).
* `annotation.&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`: attach an annotation with the respective `key` and `value` to the built image
  * Using the extended syntaxes, `annotation-&lt;type&gt;.&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`, `annotation[&lt;platform&gt;].&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;` and both combined with `annotation-&lt;type&gt;[&lt;platform&gt;].&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`, allows configuring exactly where to attach the annotation.
  * `&lt;type&gt;` specifies what object to attach to, and can be any of `manifest` (the default), `manifest-descriptor`, `index` and `index-descriptor`
  * `&lt;platform&gt;` specifies which objects to attach to (by default, all), and is the same key passed into the `platform` opt, see [`docs/multi-platform.md`](docs/multi-platform.md).
  * See [`docs/annotations.md`](docs/annotations.md) for more details.

If credentials are required, `buildctl` will attempt to read Docker configuration file `$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json`.
`$DOCKER_CONFIG` defaults to `~/.docker`.

#### Local directory

The local client will copy the files directly to the client. This is useful if BuildKit is being used for building something else than container images.

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=local,dest=path/to/output-dir
```

To export specific files use multi-stage builds with a scratch stage and copy the needed files into that stage with `COPY --from`.

```dockerfile
...
FROM scratch as testresult

COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/testresult.xml .
...
```

```bash
buildctl build ... --opt target=testresult --output type=local,dest=path/to/output-dir
```

With a [multi-platform build](docs/multi-platform.md), a subfolder matching
each target platform will be created in the destination directory:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox AS build
ARG TARGETOS
ARG TARGETARCH
RUN mkdir /out &amp;&amp; echo foo &gt; /out/hello-$TARGETOS-$TARGETARCH

FROM scratch
COPY --from=build /out /
```

```bash
$ buildctl build \
  --frontend dockerfile.v0 \
  --opt platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --output type=local,dest=./bin/release

$ tree ./bin
./bin/
└── release
    ├── linux_amd64
    │   └── hello-linux-amd64
    └── linux_arm64
        └── hello-linux-arm64
```

You can set `platform-split=false` to merge files from all platforms together
into same directory:

```bash
$ buildctl build \
  --frontend dockerfile.v0 \
  --opt platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --output type=local,dest=./bin/release,platform-split=false

$ tree ./bin
./bin/
└── release
    ├── hello-linux-amd64
    └── hello-linux-arm64
```

Tar exporter is similar to local exporter but transfers the files through a tarball.

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=tar,dest=out.tar
buildctl build ... --output type=tar &gt; out.tar
```

#### Docker tarball

```bash
# exported tarball is also compatible with OCI spec
buildctl build ... --output type=docker,name=myimage | docker load
```

#### OCI tarball

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=oci,dest=path/to/output.tar
buildctl build ... --output type=oci &gt; output.tar
```

#### containerd image store

The containerd worker needs to be used

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image
ctr --namespace=buildkit images ls
```

To change the containerd namespace, you need to change `worker.containerd.namespace` in [`/etc/buildkit/buildkitd.toml`](./docs/buildkitd.toml.md).

## Cache

To show local build cache (`/var/lib/buildkit`):

```bash
buildctl du -v
```

To prune local build cache:
```bash
buildctl prune
```

### Garbage collection

See [`./docs/buildkitd.toml.md`](./docs/buildkitd.toml.md).

### Export cache

BuildKit supports the following cache exporters:
* `inline`: embed the cache into the image, and push them to the registry together
* `registry`: push the image and the cache separately
* `local`: export to a local directory
* `gha`: export to GitHub Actions cache

In most case you want to use the `inline` cache exporter.
However, note that the `inline` cache exporter only supports `min` cache mode. 
To enable `max` cache mode, push the image and the cache separately by using `registry` cache exporter.

`inline` and `registry` exporters both store the cache in the registry. For importing the cache, `type=registry` is sufficient for both, as specifying the cache format is not necessary.

#### Inline (push image and cache together)

```bash
buildctl build ... \
  --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true \
  --export-cache type=inline \
  --import-cache type=registry,ref=docker.io/username/image
```

Note that the inline cache is not imported unless [`--import-cache type=registry,ref=...`](#registry-push-image-and-cache-separately) is provided.

Inline cache embeds cache metadata into the image config. The layers in the image will be left untouched compared to the image with no cache information.

:information_source: Docker-integrated BuildKit (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build`) and `docker buildx`requires 
`--build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1` to be specified to enable the `inline` cache exporter.
However, the standalone `buildctl` does NOT require `--opt build-arg:BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1` and the build-arg is simply ignored.

#### Registry (push image and cache separately)

```bash
buildctl build ... \
  --output type=image,name=localhost:5000/myrepo:image,push=true \
  --export-cache type=registry,ref=localhost:5000/myrepo:buildcache \
  --import-cache type=registry,ref=localhost:5000/myrepo:buildcache
```

`--export-cache` options:
* `type=registry`
* `mode=&lt;min|max&gt;`: specify cache layers to export (default: `min`)
  * `min`: only export layers for the resulting image
  * `max`: export all the layers of all intermediate steps
* `ref=&lt;ref&gt;`: specify repository re

[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/?ref=github-inngest-readme)&#039;s durable functions replace queues, state management, and scheduling to enable any developer to write reliable step functions faster without touching infrastructure.

1. Write durable functions using any of [**our language SDKs**](#sdks)
2. Run the [**Inngest Dev Server**](#getting-started) for a complete local development experience, with production parity.
3. Deploy your functions to your own infrastructure
4. Sync your application&#039;s functions with the [**Inngest Platform**](https://www.inngest.com/?ref=github-inngest-readme) or a [self-hosted Inngest server](#self-hosting).
5. Inngest invokes your functions securely via HTTPS whenever triggering events are received.

### An example durable function

Inngest Functions enable developers to run reliable background logic, from background jobs to complex workflows. An Inngest Function is composed of three key parts that provide robust support for retrying, scheduling, and coordinating complex sequences of operations:

- [**Triggers**](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Events, Cron schedules or webhook events that trigger the function.
- [**Flow Control**](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Configure how the function runs are enqueued and executed including concurrency, throttling, debouncing, rate limiting, and prioritization.
- [**Steps**](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Steps are fundamental building blocks of Inngest, turning your Inngest Functions into reliable workflows that can runs for months and recover from failures.

Here is an example function that limits concurrency for each unique user id and performs two steps that will be retried on error:

```typescript
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: &quot;import-product-images&quot;,
    concurrency: {
      key: &quot;event.data.userId&quot;,
      limit: 10
    }
  },
  { event: &quot;shop/product.imported&quot; },
  async ({ event, step }) =&gt; {
    // Here goes the business logic
    // By wrapping code in steps, each will be retried automatically on failure
    const s3Urls = await step.run(&quot;copy-images-to-s3&quot;, async () =&gt; {
      return copyAllImagesToS3(event.data.imageURLs);
    });
    // You can include numerous steps in your function
    await step.run(&quot;resize-images&quot;, async () =&gt; {
      await resizer.bulk({ urls: s3Urls, quality: 0.9, maxWidth: 1024 });
    })
  };
);

// Elsewhere in your code (e.g. in your API endpoint):
await inngest.send({
  name: &quot;shop/product.imported&quot;,
  data: {
    userId: &quot;01J8G44701QYGE0DH65PZM8DPM&quot;,
    imageURLs: [
      &quot;https://useruploads.acme.com/q2345678/1094.jpg&quot;,
      &quot;https://useruploads.acme.com/q2345678/1095.jpg&quot;
    ],
  },
});
```

## Project Architecture

To understand how self-hosting works, it&#039;s valuable to understand the architecture and system components at a high level. We&#039;ll take a look at a simplified architecture diagram and walk through the system.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/architecture-2024-09-23.png&quot; alt=&quot;System Architecture&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- **Event API** - Receives events from SDKs via HTTP requests. Authenticates client requests via [Event Keys](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events/creating-an-event-key?ref=github-inngest-readme). The Event API publishes event payloads to an internal event stream.
- **Event stream** - Acts as buffer between the _Event API_ and the _Runner_.
- **Runner** - Consumes incoming events and performs several actions:
  - Scheduling of new “function runs” (aka jobs) given the event type, creating initial run state in the _State store_ database. Runs are added to queues given the function&#039;s flow control configuration.
  - Resume functions paused via [`waitForEvent`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/wait-for-event?ref=github-inngest-readme) with matching expressions.
  - Cancels running functions with matching [`cancelOn`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancellation/cancel-on-events?ref=github-inngest-readme) expressions
  - Writes ingested events to a database for historical record and future replay.
- **Queue** - A multi-tenant aware, multi-tier queue designed for fairness and various [flow control](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control?ref=github-inngest-readme) methods (concurrency, throttling, prioritization, debouncing, rate limiting) and [batching](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/batching?ref=github-inngest-readme).
- **Executor** - Responsible for executing functions, from initial execution, step execution, writing incremental function run state to the _State store_, and retries after failures.
- **State store (database)** - Persists data for pending and ongoing function runs. Data includes initial triggering event(s), step output and step errors.
- **Database** - Persists system data and history including Apps, Functions, Events, Function run results.
- **API** - GraphQL and REST APIs for programmatic access and management of system resources.
- **Dashboard UI** - The UI to manage apps, functions and view function run history.

![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true &quot;Docker Compose Logo&quot;)

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.

&gt; **Note**: About Docker Swarm
&gt; Docker Swarm used to rely on the legacy compose file format but did not adopt the compose specification
&gt; so is missing some of the recent enhancements in the compose syntax. After 
&gt; [acquisition by Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/software/swarm/) swarm isn&#039;t maintained by Docker Inc, and
&gt; as such some Docker Compose features aren&#039;t accessible to swarm users.

# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app&#039;s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `compose.yaml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - &quot;5000:5000&quot;
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```

Contributing
------------

[contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you find an issue, please report it on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).

Legacy
-------------

The Python version of Compose is available under the `v1` [branch](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1).

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it&#039;ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don&#039;t need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It&#039;s based on software we use for our public [AdGuard DNS] servers, and both share a lot of code.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison&quot; id=&quot;comparison&quot; name=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparing AdGuard Home to other solutions&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adguard-dns&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot;&gt;How is this different from public AdGuard DNS servers?&lt;/a&gt;

Running your own AdGuard Home server allows you to do much more than using a public DNS server. It&#039;s a completely different level. See for yourself:

- Choose what exactly the server blocks and permits.

- Monitor your network activity.

- Add your own custom filtering rules.

- **Most importantly, it&#039;s your own server, and you are the only one who&#039;s in control.**

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-pi-hole&quot; id=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot; name=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;

At this point, AdGuard Home has a lot in common with Pi-Hole. Both block ads and trackers using the so-called “DNS sinkholing” method and both allow customizing what&#039;s blocked.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We&#039;re not going to stop here. DNS sinkholing is not a bad starting point, but this is just the beginning.

AdGuard Home provides a lot of features out-of-the-box with no need to install and configure additional software. We want it to be simple to the point when even casual users can set it up with minimal effort.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Some of the listed features can be added to Pi-Hole by installing additional software or by manually using SSH terminal and reconfiguring one of the utilities Pi-Hole consists of. However, in our opinion, this cannot be legitimately counted as a Pi-Hole&#039;s feature.

| Feature                                                                 | AdGuard&amp;nbsp;Home | Pi-Hole                                                   |

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adblock&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to traditional ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;

It depends.

DNS sinkholing is capable of blocking a big percentage of ads, but it lacks the flexibility and the power of traditional ad blockers. You can get a good impression about the difference between these methods by reading [this article][blog-adaway], which compares AdGuard for Android (a traditional ad blocker) to hosts-level ad blockers (which are almost identical to DNS-based blockers in their capabilities). This level of protection is enough for some users.

Additionally, using a DNS-based blocker can help to block ads, tracking and analytics requests on other types of devices, such as SmartTVs, smart speakers or other kinds of IoT devices (on which you can&#039;t install traditional ad blockers).

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-limitations&quot; id=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot; name=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot;&gt;Known limitations&lt;/a&gt;

Here are some examples of what cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker:

- YouTube, Twitch ads;

- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram sponsored posts.

Essentially, any advertising that shares a domain with content cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker.

Is there a chance to handle this in the future?  DNS will never be enough to do this. Our only option is to use a content blocking proxy like what we do in the standalone AdGuard applications. We&#039;re [going to bring][issue-1228] this feature support to AdGuard Home in the future. Unfortunately, even in this case, there still will be cases when this won&#039;t be enough or would require quite a complicated configuration.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#how-to-build&quot; id=&quot;how-to-build&quot; name=&quot;how-to-build&quot;&gt;How to build from source&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#prerequisites&quot; id=&quot;prerequisites&quot; name=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make init` to prepare the development environment.

You will need this to build AdGuard Home:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.25 or later;
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v24.10.0 or later;
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v10.8 or later;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#building&quot; id=&quot;building&quot; name=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt;

Open your terminal and execute these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome
cd AdGuardHome
make
```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The non-standard `-j` flag is currently not supported, so building with `make -j 4` or setting your `MAKEFLAGS` to include, for example, `-j 4` is likely to break the build. If you do have your `MAKEFLAGS` set to that, and you don&#039;t want to change it, you can override it by running `make -j 1`.

Check the [`Makefile`][src-makefile] to learn about other commands.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#building-cross&quot; id=&quot;building-cross&quot; name=&quot;building-cross&quot;&gt;Building for a different platform&lt;/a&gt;

You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports. In order to do this, specify `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables as macros when running `make`.

For example:

```sh
env GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039; make
```

or:

```sh
make GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039;
```

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#preparing-releases&quot; id=&quot;preparing-releases&quot; name=&quot;preparing-releases&quot;&gt;Preparing releases&lt;/a&gt;

You&#039;ll need [`snapcraft`] to prepare a release build. Once installed, run the following command:

```sh
make build-release CHANNEL=&#039;...&#039; VERSION=&#039;...&#039;
```

See the [`build-release` target documentation][targ-release].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#docker-image&quot; id=&quot;docker-image&quot; name=&quot;docker-image&quot;&gt;Docker image&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make build-docker` to build the Docker image locally (the one that we publish to DockerHub). Please note, that we&#039;re using [Docker Buildx][buildx] to build our official image.

You may need to prepare before using these builds:

- (Linux-only) Install Qemu:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes --credential yes
  ```

- Prepare the builder:

  ```sh
  docker buildx create --name buildx-builder --driver docker-container --use
  ```

See the [`build-docker` target documentation][targ-docker].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#debugging-the-frontend&quot; id=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot; name=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot;&gt;Debugging the frontend&lt;/a&gt;

When you need to debug the frontend without recompiling the production version every time, for example to check how your labels would look on a form, you can run the frontend build a development environment.

1. In a separate terminal, run:

   ```sh
   ( cd ./client/ &amp;&amp; env NODE_ENV=&#039;development&#039; npm run watch )
   ```

2. Run your `AdGuardHome` binary with the `--local-frontend` flag, which instructs AdGuard Home to ignore the built-in frontend files and use those from the `./build/` directory.

3. Now any changes you make in the `./client/` directory should be recompiled and become available on the web UI. Make sure that you disable the browser cache to make sure that you actually get the recompiled version.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#e2e-frontend-tests&quot; id=&quot;e2e-frontend-tests&quot; name=&quot;e2e-frontend-tests&quot;&gt;End-to-End (E2E) Frontend Tests&lt;/a&gt;

AdGuard Home uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for E2E testing. Tests are located in `tests/e2e`.

**Running Tests:**
- `npm run test:e2e` – run all tests (headless).
- `npm run test:e2e:interactive` – run tests interactively.
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` – run tests in debug mode.
- `npm run test:e2e:codegen` – generate new test code.

**Setup:**
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npx playwright install` to set up required browsers.

&gt; **Warning:** Playwright will download and install its own browser binaries for testing, which may differ from the browsers installed on your system.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#test-unstable-versions&quot; id=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot; name=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot;&gt;Test unstable versions&lt;/a&gt;

There are two update channels that you can use:

- `beta`: beta versions of AdGuard Home. More or less stable versions, usually released every two weeks or more often.

- `edge`: the newest version of AdGuard Home from the development branch. New updates are pushed to this channel daily.

There are three options how you can install an unstable version:

1. [Snap Store]: look for the `beta` and `edge` channels.

2. [Docker Hub]: look for the `beta` and `edge` tags.

3. Standalone builds. Use the automated installation script or look for the available builds [on the Wiki][wiki-platf].

   Script to install a beta version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c beta
   ```

   Script to install an edge version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c edge
   ```

Rogue is a powerful tool designed to evaluate the performance, compliance, and reliability of AI agents. It pits a dynamic `EvaluatorAgent` against your agent using various protocols, testing it with a range of scenarios to ensure it behaves exactly as intended.


## Architecture

Rogue operates on a **client-server architecture**:

- **Rogue Server**: Contains the core evaluation logic
- **Client Interfaces**: Multiple interfaces that connect to the server:
  - **TUI (Terminal UI)**: Modern terminal interface built with Go and Bubble Tea
  - **Web UI**: Gradio-based web interface
  - **CLI**: Command-line interface for automated evaluation and CI/CD

This architecture allows for flexible deployment and usage patterns, where the server can run independently and multiple clients can connect to it simultaneously.

### Supported Protocols &amp; Transports:
Rogue can communicate with your agent using various protocols and transports:

#### A2A
Rogue supports [Google&#039;s A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/) protocol over these transports:
1. HTTP

To integrate your agent with Rogue via A2A:
1. Build your agent using any framework of your choice
2. Expose your agent through an A2A-compliant HTTP server
3. Rogue will communicate with your agent using the standardized A2A protocol

The A2A protocol provides a standardized way for agents to communicate, including support for streaming responses, task management, and agent capabilities discovery.

For reference implementations, check out the A2A examples in the [`examples/tshirt_store_agent/`](./examples/tshirt_store_agent/) and [`examples/tshirt_store_langgraph_agent/`](./examples/tshirt_store_langgraph_agent/) directories.

#### MCP
Rogue supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) over these transports:
1. SSE (Server-Sent Events)
2. STREAMABLE_HTTP

To integrate your agent with Rogue via MCP:
1. Build your agent using any framework of your choice
2. Wrap your agent with an MCP server that exposes a tool named `send_message`
3. Rogue will invoke this tool to communicate with and evaluate your agent

The `send_message` tool should accept a message from Rogue and return your agent&#039;s response. This simple interface allows Rogue to interact with your agent regardless of its internal implementation.

For reference implementations, check out the MCP examples in the [`examples/mcp/`](./examples/mcp/) directory, which demonstrates how to wrap a LangGraph agent with MCP for use with Rogue.

## 🔥 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- `uvx` - If not installed, follow [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Python 3.10+
- An API key for an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic).

### Installation

#### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended)

Use our automated install script to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# TUI
uvx rogue-ai

# Web UI
uvx rogue-ai ui

# CLI / CI/CD
uvx rogue-ai cli
```

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qualifire-dev/rogue.git
    cd rogue
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    If you are using uv:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    Or, if you are using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

3.  **OPTIONALLY: Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys. Rogue uses `LiteLLM`, so you can set keys for various providers.
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;sk-...&quot;
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&quot;sk-...&quot;
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=&quot;...&quot;
    ```

### Running Rogue

Rogue operates on a client-server architecture where the core evaluation logic runs in a backend server, and various clients connect to it for different interfaces.

#### Default Behavior

When you run `uvx rogue-ai` without any mode specified, it:

1. Starts the Rogue server in the background
2. Launches the TUI (Terminal User Interface) client

```bash
uvx rogue-ai
```

#### Available Modes

- **Default (Server + TUI)**: `uvx rogue-ai` - Starts server in background + TUI client
- **Server**: `uvx rogue-ai server` - Runs only the backend server
- **TUI**: `uvx rogue-ai tui` - Runs only the TUI client (requires server running)
- **Web UI**: `uvx rogue-ai ui` - Runs only the Gradio web interface client (requires server running)
- **CLI**: `uvx rogue-ai cli` - Runs non-interactive command-line evaluation (requires server running, ideal for CI/CD)

#### Mode Arguments

This repository includes a simple example agent that sells T-shirts. You can use it to see Rogue in action.

### Option 1: All-in-One (Recommended)

The easiest way to try Rogue with the example agent is to use the `--example` flag, which starts both Rogue and the example agent automatically:

```bash
uvx rogue-ai --example=tshirt_store
```

This will:

- Start the T-Shirt Store agent on `http://localhost:10001`
- Launch Rogue with the TUI interface
- Automatically clean up when you exit

You can customize the host and port:

```bash
uvx rogue-ai --example=tshirt_store --example-host localhost --example-port 10001
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to run the example agent separately:

1. **Install example dependencies:**

   If you are using uv:

   ```bash
   uv sync --group examples
   ```

   or, if you are using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[examples]
   ```

2. **Start the example agent server** in a separate terminal:

   If you are using uv:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m examples.tshirt_store_agent
   ```

   Or using the script command:

   ```bash
   uv run rogue-ai-example-tshirt
   ```

   Or if installed:

   ```bash
   uvx rogue-ai-example-tshirt
   ```

   This will start the agent on `http://localhost:10001`.

3. **Configure Rogue** in the UI to point to the example agent:

   - **Agent URL**: `http://localhost:10001`
   - **Authentication**: `no-auth`

4. **Run the evaluation** and watch Rogue test the T-Shirt agent&#039;s policies!

   You can use either the TUI (`uvx rogue-ai`) or Web UI (`uvx rogue-ai ui`) mode.

## 🔧 CLI Mode

The CLI mode provides a **non-interactive** command-line interface for evaluating AI agents against predefined scenarios. It connects to the Rogue server to perform evaluations and is **ideal for CI/CD pipelines** and automated testing workflows.

### 🚀 Usage

The CLI mode requires the Rogue server to be running. You can either:

1. **Start server separately:**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start the server
   uvx rogue-ai server

   # Terminal 2: Run CLI evaluation
   uvx rogue-ai cli [OPTIONS]
   ```

2. **Use the default mode (starts server + TUI, then use TUI for evaluation)**

For development or if you prefer to install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qualifire-dev/rogue.git
cd rogue
uv sync
uv run -m rogue cli [OPTIONS]
```

Or, if you are using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qualifire-dev/rogue.git
cd rogue
pip install -e .
uv run -m rogue cli [OPTIONS]
```

### 📊 Config file

The config file is automatically generated when running the UI. \
We will check for a config file in `&lt;workdir&gt;/user_config.json` and use it if it exists. \
The config file is a JSON object that can contain all or a subset of the fields from the CLI arguments, except for `--config-file`. \
Other keys in the config file are ignored. \
Just remember to use snake_case keys. (e.g. `--evaluated-agent-url` becomes `evaluated_agent_url`).

### Notes

1. ⚠️ Either `--business-context` or `--business-context-file` must be provided.
2. ⚠️ Fields marked as Required are required unless supplied via the config file.

---

### Examples

### With only a config file:

with our business context located at `./.rogue/business_context.md`

#### `./.rogue/user_config.json`

```json
{
  &quot;evaluated_agent_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:10001&quot;,
  &quot;judge_llm&quot;: &quot;openai/o4-mini&quot;
}
```

#### Execution

```bash
uvx rogue-ai cli
```

### Same example without a config file:

#### Execution

```bash
uvx rogue-ai cli \
    --evaluated-agent-url http://localhost:10001 \
    --judge-llm openai/o4-mini \
    --business-context-file &#039;./.rogue/business_context.md&#039;
```

## How It Works

Rogue&#039;s workflow is designed to be simple and intuitive, managed entirely through its web interface.

1.  **Configure**: You provide the endpoint and authentication details for the agent you want to test, and select the LLMs you want Rogue to use for its services (scenario generation, judging).
2.  **Generate Scenarios**: You input the &quot;business context&quot; or a high-level description of what your agent is supposed to do. Rogue&#039;s `LLM Service` uses this context to generate a list of relevant test scenarios. You can review and edit these scenarios.
3.  **Run &amp; Evaluate**: You start the evaluation. The `Scenario Evaluation Service` spins up the `EvaluatorAgent`, which begins a conversation with your agent for each scenario. You can watch this conversation happen live.
4.  **View Report**: Once all scenarios are complete, the `LLM Service` analyzes the results and generates a Markdown-formatted report, giving you a clear summary of your agent&#039;s performance.

## Introduction

Syft is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for container images and filesystems. It provides detailed visibility into the packages and dependencies in your software, helping you manage vulnerabilities, license compliance, and software supply chain security.

Syft development is sponsored by [Anchore](https://anchore.com/), and is released under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file). For commercial support options with Syft or Grype, please [contact Anchore](https://get.anchore.com/contact/).

## Features
- Generates SBOMs for container images, filesystems, archives, and more to discover packages and libraries
- Supports OCI, Docker and [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) image formats
- Linux distribution identification
- Works seamlessly with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) (a fast, modern vulnerability scanner)
- Able to create signed SBOM attestations using the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md)
- Convert between SBOM formats, such as CycloneDX, SPDX, and Syft&#039;s own format.

## Installation

Syft binaries are provided for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Recommended
&gt; ```bash
&gt; curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/syft | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
&gt; ```

Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Homebrew
```bash
brew install syft
```

### Scoop

```powershell
scoop install syft
```

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of Syft is community-maintained and not distributed by the Anchore team

```powershell
choco install syft -y
```

### Nix

**Note**: Nix packaging of Syft is [community maintained](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/sy/syft/package.nix). Syft is available in the [stable channel](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_channels#The_official_channels) since NixOS `22.05`.

```bash
nix-env -i syft
```

... or, just try it out in an ephemeral nix shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p syft
```

## Getting started

### SBOM

To generate an SBOM for a container image:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt;
```

The above output includes only software that is visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the SBOM, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

### Output formats

The output format for Syft is configurable as well using the `-o` (or `--output`) option:

```
syft &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the `formats` available are:
- `syft-json`: Use this to get as much information out of Syft as possible!
- `syft-text`: A row-oriented, human-and-machine-friendly output.
- `cyclonedx-xml`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-xml@1.5`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json@1.5`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `spdx-tag-value`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/).
- `spdx-tag-value@2.2`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.2.2/).
- `spdx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.3/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `spdx-json@2.2`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.2/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `github-json`: A JSON report conforming to GitHub&#039;s dependency snapshot format.
- `syft-table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](https://github.com/anchore/syft/wiki/using-templates) below.

Note that flags using the @&lt;version&gt; can be used for earlier versions of each specification as well.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;get json values quickly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

GJSON is a Go package that provides a [fast](#performance) and [simple](#get-a-value) way to get values from a json document.
It has features such as [one line retrieval](#get-a-value), [dot notation paths](#path-syntax), [iteration](#iterate-through-an-object-or-array), and [parsing json lines](#json-lines).

Also check out [SJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/sjson) for modifying json, and the [JJ](https://github.com/tidwall/jj) command line tool.

This README is a quick overview of how to use GJSON, for more information check out [GJSON Syntax](SYNTAX.md).

GJSON is also available for [Python](https://github.com/volans-/gjson-py) and [Rust](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson.rs)

Getting Started
===============

## Installing

To start using GJSON, install Go and run `go get`:

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/tidwall/gjson
```

This will retrieve the library.

## Get a value
Get searches json for the specified path. A path is in dot syntax, such as &quot;name.last&quot; or &quot;age&quot;. When the value is found it&#039;s returned immediately. 

```go
package main

import &quot;github.com/tidwall/gjson&quot;

const json = `{&quot;name&quot;:{&quot;first&quot;:&quot;Janet&quot;,&quot;last&quot;:&quot;Prichard&quot;},&quot;age&quot;:47}`

func main() {
	value := gjson.Get(json, &quot;name.last&quot;)
	println(value.String())
}
```

This will print:

```
Prichard
```
*There&#039;s also [GetBytes](#working-with-bytes) for working with JSON byte slices.*

## Path Syntax

Below is a quick overview of the path syntax, for more complete information please
check out [GJSON Syntax](SYNTAX.md).

A path is a series of keys separated by a dot.
A key may contain special wildcard characters &#039;\*&#039; and &#039;?&#039;.
To access an array value use the index as the key.
To get the number of elements in an array or to access a child path, use the &#039;#&#039; character.
The dot and wildcard characters can be escaped with &#039;\\&#039;.

```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: {&quot;first&quot;: &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Anderson&quot;},
  &quot;age&quot;:37,
  &quot;children&quot;: [&quot;Sara&quot;,&quot;Alex&quot;,&quot;Jack&quot;],
  &quot;fav.movie&quot;: &quot;Deer Hunter&quot;,
  &quot;friends&quot;: [
    {&quot;first&quot;: &quot;Dale&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Murphy&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 44, &quot;nets&quot;: [&quot;ig&quot;, &quot;fb&quot;, &quot;tw&quot;]},
    {&quot;first&quot;: &quot;Roger&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Craig&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 68, &quot;nets&quot;: [&quot;fb&quot;, &quot;tw&quot;]},
    {&quot;first&quot;: &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Murphy&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 47, &quot;nets&quot;: [&quot;ig&quot;, &quot;tw&quot;]}
  ]
}
```
```
&quot;name.last&quot;          &gt;&gt; &quot;Anderson&quot;
&quot;age&quot;                &gt;&gt; 37
&quot;children&quot;           &gt;&gt; [&quot;Sara&quot;,&quot;Alex&quot;,&quot;Jack&quot;]
&quot;children.#&quot;         &gt;&gt; 3
&quot;children.1&quot;         &gt;&gt; &quot;Alex&quot;
&quot;child*.2&quot;           &gt;&gt; &quot;Jack&quot;
&quot;c?ildren.0&quot;         &gt;&gt; &quot;Sara&quot;
&quot;fav\.movie&quot;         &gt;&gt; &quot;Deer Hunter&quot;
&quot;friends.#.first&quot;    &gt;&gt; [&quot;Dale&quot;,&quot;Roger&quot;,&quot;Jane&quot;]
&quot;friends.1.last&quot;     &gt;&gt; &quot;Craig&quot;
```

You can also query an array for the first match by using `#(...)`, or find all 
matches with `#(...)#`. Queries support the `==`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=` 
comparison operators and the simple pattern matching `%` (like) and `!%` 
(not like) operators.

```
friends.#(last==&quot;Murphy&quot;).first    &gt;&gt; &quot;Dale&quot;
friends.#(last==&quot;Murphy&quot;)#.first   &gt;&gt; [&quot;Dale&quot;,&quot;Jane&quot;]
friends.#(age&gt;45)#.last            &gt;&gt; [&quot;Craig&quot;,&quot;Murphy&quot;]
friends.#(first%&quot;D*&quot;).last         &gt;&gt; &quot;Murphy&quot;
friends.#(first!%&quot;D*&quot;).last        &gt;&gt; &quot;Craig&quot;
friends.#(nets.#(==&quot;fb&quot;))#.first   &gt;&gt; [&quot;Dale&quot;,&quot;Roger&quot;]
```

*Please note that prior to v1.3.0, queries used the `#[...]` brackets. This was
changed in v1.3.0 as to avoid confusion with the new
[multipath](SYNTAX.md#multipaths) syntax. For backwards compatibility, 
`#[...]` will continue to work until the next major release.*

## Result Type

GJSON supports the json types `string`, `number`, `bool`, and `null`. 
Arrays and Objects are returned as their raw json types. 

The `Result` type holds one of these:

```
bool, for JSON booleans
float64, for JSON numbers
string, for JSON string literals
nil, for JSON null
```

To directly access the value:

```go
result.Type           // can be String, Number, True, False, Null, or JSON
result.Str            // holds the string
result.Num            // holds the float64 number
result.Raw            // holds the raw json
result.Index          // index of raw value in original json, zero means index unknown
result.Indexes        // indexes of all the elements that match on a path containing the &#039;#&#039; query character.
```

There are a variety of handy functions that work on a result:

```go
result.Exists() bool
result.Value() interface{}
result.Int() int64
result.Uint() uint64
result.Float() float64
result.String() string
result.Bool() bool
result.Time() time.Time
result.Array() []gjson.Result
result.Map() map[string]gjson.Result
result.Get(path string) Result
result.ForEach(iterator func(key, value Result) bool)
result.Less(token Result, caseSensitive bool) bool
```

The `result.Value()` function returns an `interface{}` which requires type assertion and is one of the following Go types:

```go
boolean &gt;&gt; bool
number  &gt;&gt; float64
string  &gt;&gt; string
null    &gt;&gt; nil
array   &gt;&gt; []interface{}
object  &gt;&gt; map[string]interface{}
```

The `result.Array()` function returns back an array of values.
If the result represents a non-existent value, then an empty array will be returned.
If the result is not a JSON array, the return value will be an array containing one result.

### 64-bit integers

The `result.Int()` and `result.Uint()` calls are capable of reading all 64 bits, allowing for large JSON integers.

```go
result.Int() int64    // -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
result.Uint() uint64   // 0 to 18446744073709551615
```

## Modifiers and path chaining 

New in version 1.2 is support for modifier functions and path chaining.

A modifier is a path component that performs custom processing on the 
json.

Multiple paths can be &quot;chained&quot; together using the pipe character. 
This is useful for getting results from a modified query.

For example, using the built-in `@reverse` modifier on the above json document,
we&#039;ll get `children` array and reverse the order:

```
&quot;children|@reverse&quot;           &gt;&gt; [&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;Alex&quot;,&quot;Sara&quot;]
&quot;children|@reverse|0&quot;         &gt;&gt; &quot;Jack&quot;
```

There are currently the following built-in modifiers:

- `@reverse`: Reverse an array or the members of an object.
- `@ugly`: Remove all whitespace from a json document.
- `@pretty`: Make the json document more human readable.
- `@this`: Returns the current element. It can be used to retrieve the root element.
- `@valid`: Ensure the json document is valid.
- `@flatten`: Flattens an array.
- `@join`: Joins multiple objects into a single object.
- `@keys`: Returns an array of keys for an object.
- `@values`: Returns an array of values for an object.
- `@tostr`: Converts json to a string. Wraps a json string.
- `@fromstr`: Converts a string from json. Unwraps a json string.
- `@group`: Groups arrays of objects. See [e4fc67c](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/commit/e4fc67c92aeebf2089fabc7872f010e340d105db).
- `@dig`: Search for a value without providing its entire path. See [e8e87f2](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/commit/e8e87f2a00dc41f3aba5631094e21f59a8cf8cbf).

### Modifier arguments

A modifier may accept an optional argument. The argument can be a valid JSON 
document or just characters.

For example, the `@pretty` modifier takes a json object as its argument. 

```
@pretty:{&quot;sortKeys&quot;:true} 
```

Which makes the json pretty and orders all of its keys.

```json
{
  &quot;age&quot;:37,
  &quot;children&quot;: [&quot;Sara&quot;,&quot;Alex&quot;,&quot;Jack&quot;],
  &quot;fav.movie&quot;: &quot;Deer Hunter&quot;,
  &quot;friends&quot;: [
    {&quot;age&quot;: 44, &quot;first&quot;: &quot;Dale&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Murphy&quot;},
    {&quot;age&quot;: 68, &quot;first&quot;: &quot;Roger&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Craig&quot;},
    {&quot;age&quot;: 47, &quot;first&quot;: &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Murphy&quot;}
  ],
  &quot;name&quot;: {&quot;first&quot;: &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;last&quot;: &quot;Anderson&quot;}
}
```

*The full list of `@pretty` options are `sortKeys`, `indent`, `prefix`, and `width`. 
Please see [Pretty Options](https://github.com/tidwall/pretty#customized-output) for more information.*

### Custom modifiers

You can also add custom modifiers.

For example, here we create a modifier that makes the entire json document upper
or lower case.

```go
gjson.AddModifier(&quot;case&quot;, func(json, arg string) string {
  if arg == &quot;upper&quot; {
    return strings.ToUpper(json)
  }
  if arg == &quot;lower&quot; {
    return strings.ToLower(json)
  }
  return json
})
```

```
&quot;children|@case:upper&quot;           &gt;&gt; [&quot;SARA&quot;,&quot;ALEX&quot;,&quot;JACK&quot;]
&quot;children|@case:lower|@reverse&quot;  &gt;&gt; [&quot;jack&quot;,&quot;alex&quot;,&quot;sara&quot;]
```

## JSON Lines

There&#039;s support for [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) using the `..` prefix, which treats a multilined document as an array. 

For example:

```
{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Gilbert&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 61}
{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alexa&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 34}
{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;May&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 57}
{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deloise&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 44}
```

```
..#                   &gt;&gt; 4
..1                   &gt;&gt; {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alexa&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 34}
..3                   &gt;&gt; {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deloise&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 44}
..#.name              &gt;&gt; [&quot;Gilbert&quot;,&quot;Alexa&quot;,&quot;May&quot;,&quot;Deloise&quot;]
..#(name=&quot;May&quot;).age   &gt;&gt; 57
```

The `ForEachLines` function will iterate through JSON lines.

```go
gjson.ForEachLine(json, func(line gjson.Result) bool{
    println(line.String())
    return true
})
```

## Get nested array values

Suppose you want all the last names from the following json:

```json
{
  &quot;programmers&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Janet&quot;, 
      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;McLaughlin&quot;, 
    }, {
      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Elliotte&quot;, 
      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Hunter&quot;, 
    }, {
      &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Jason&quot;, 
      &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Harold&quot;, 
    }
  ]
}
```

You would use the path &quot;programmers.#.lastName&quot; like such:

```go
result := gjson.Get(json, &quot;programmers.#.lastName&quot;)
for _, name := range result.Array() {
	println(name.String())
}
```

You can also query an object inside an array:

```go
name := gjson.Get(json, `programmers.#(lastName=&quot;Hunter&quot;).firstName`)
println(name.String())  // prints &quot;Elliotte&quot;
```

## Iterate through an object or array

The `ForEach` function allows for quickly iterating through an object or array. 
The key and value are passed to the iterator function for objects.
Only the value is passed for arrays.
Returning `false` from an iterator will stop iteration.

```go
result := gjson.Get(json, &quot;programmers&quot;)
result.ForEach(func(key, value gjson.Result) bool {
	println(value.String()) 
	return true // keep iterating
})
```

## Simple Parse and Get

There&#039;s a `Parse(json)` function that will do a simple parse, and `result.Get(path)` that will search a result.

For example, all of these will return the same result:

```go
gjson.Parse(json).Get(&quot;name&quot;).Get(&quot;last&quot;)
gjson.Get(json, &quot;name&quot;).Get(&quot;last&quot;)
gjson.Get(json, &quot;name.last&quot;)
```

## Check for the existence of a value

Sometimes you just want to know if a value exists. 

```go
value := gjson.Get(json, &quot;name.last&quot;)
if !value.Exists() {
	println(&quot;no last name&quot;)
} else {
	println(value.String())
}

// Or as one step
if gjson.Get(json, &quot;name.last&quot;).Exists() {
	println(&quot;has a last name&quot;)
}
```

## Validate JSON

The `Get*` and `Parse*` functions expects that the json is well-formed. Bad json will not panic, but it may return back unexpected results.

If you are consuming JSON from an unpredictable source then you may want to validate prior to using GJSON.

```go
if !gjson.Valid(json) {
	return errors.New(&quot;invalid json&quot;)
}
value := gjson.Get(json, &quot;name.last&quot;)
```

## Unmarshal to a map

To unmarshal to a `map[string]interface{}`:

```go
m, ok := gjson.Parse(json).Value().(map[string]interface{})
if !ok {
	// not a map
}
```

## Working with Bytes

If your JSON is contained in a `[]byte` slice, there&#039;s the [GetBytes](https://godoc.org/github.com/tidwall/gjson#GetBytes) function. This is preferred over `Get(string(data), path)`.

```go
var json []byte = ...
result := gjson.GetBytes(json, path)
```

If you are using the `gjson.GetBytes(json, path)` function and you want to avoid converting `result.Raw` to a `[]byte`, then you can use this pattern:

```go
var json []byte = ...
result := gjson.GetBytes(json, path)
var raw []byte
if result.Index &gt; 0 {
    raw = json[result.Index:result.Index+len(result.Raw)]
} else {
    raw = []byte(result.Raw)
}
```

This is a best-effort no allocation sub slice of the original json. This method utilizes the `result.Index` field, which is the position of the raw data in the original json. It&#039;s possible that the value of `result.Index` equals zero, in which case the `result.Raw` is converted to a `[]byte`.

## Introduction

This is a golang library for working with container registries.
It&#039;s largely based on the [Python library of the same name](https://github.com/google/containerregistry).

The following diagram shows the main types that this library handles.
![OCI image representation](images/ociimage.jpeg)

## Philosophy

The overarching design philosophy of this library is to define interfaces that present an immutable
view of resources (e.g. [`Image`](https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-containerregistry/pkg/v1#Image),
[`Layer`](https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-containerregistry/pkg/v1#Layer),
[`ImageIndex`](https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-containerregistry/pkg/v1#ImageIndex)),
which can be backed by a variety of medium (e.g. [registry](./pkg/v1/remote/README.md),
[tarball](./pkg/v1/tarball/README.md), [daemon](./pkg/v1/daemon/README.md), ...).

To complement these immutable views, we support functional mutations that produce new immutable views
of the resulting resource (e.g. [mutate](./pkg/v1/mutate/README.md)).  The end goal is to provide a
set of versatile primitives that can compose to do extraordinarily powerful things efficiently and easily.

Both the resource views and mutations may be lazy, eager, memoizing, etc, and most are optimized
for common paths based on the tooling we have seen in the wild (e.g. writing new images from disk
to the registry as a compressed tarball).


### Experiments

Over time, we will add new functionality under experimental environment variables listed here.

| Env Var | Value(s) | What is does |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| `GGCR_EXPERIMENT_ESTARGZ` | `&quot;1&quot;` | ⚠️DEPRECATED⚠️: When enabled this experiment will direct `tarball.LayerFromOpener` to emit [estargz](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/issues/815) compatible layers, which enable them to be lazily loaded by an appropriately configured containerd. |

#### Sinks

## Overview

### `mutate`

The simplest use for these libraries is to read from one source and write to another.

For example,

 * `crane pull` is `remote.Image -&gt; tarball.Write`,
 * `crane push` is `tarball.Image -&gt; remote.Write`,
 * `crane cp` is `remote.Image -&gt; remote.Write`.

However, often you actually want to _change something_ about an image.
This is the purpose of the [`mutate`](pkg/v1/mutate) package, which exposes
some commonly useful things to change about an image.

### `partial`

If you&#039;re trying to use this library with a different source or sink than it already supports,
it can be somewhat cumbersome. The `Image` and `Layer` interfaces are pretty wide, with a lot
of redundant information. This is somewhat by design, because we want to expose this information
as efficiently as possible where we can, but again it is a pain to implement yourself.

The purpose of the [`partial`](pkg/v1/partial) package is to make implementing a `v1.Image`
much easier, by filling in all the derived accessors for you if you implement a minimal
subset of `v1.Image`.

### `transport`

You might think our abstractions are bad and you just want to authenticate
and send requests to a registry.

This is the purpose of the [`transport`](pkg/v1/remote/transport) and [`authn`](pkg/authn) packages.

## Tools

This repo hosts some tools built on top of the library.

### `crane`

[`crane`](cmd/crane/README.md) is a tool for interacting with remote images
and registries.

### `gcrane`

[`gcrane`](cmd/gcrane/README.md) is a GCR-specific variant of `crane` that has
richer output for the `ls` subcommand and some basic garbage collection support.

### `krane`

[`krane`](cmd/krane/README.md) is a drop-in replacement for `crane` that supports
common Kubernetes-based workload identity mechanisms using [`k8schain`](#k8schain)
as a fallback to traditional authentication mechanisms.

### `k8schain`

[`k8schain`](pkg/authn/k8schain/README.md) implements the authentication
semantics used by kubelets in a way that is easily consumable by this library.

`k8schain` is not a standalone tool, but it is linked here for visibility.

### Emeritus: [`ko`](https://github.com/google/ko)

This tool was originally developed in this repo but has since been moved to its
own repo.

**Talos** is a modern OS for running Kubernetes: secure, immutable, and minimal.
Talos is fully open source, production-ready, and supported by the people at [Sidero Labs](https://www.SideroLabs.com/).
All system management is done via an API - there is no shell or interactive console.
Benefits include:

- **Security**: Talos reduces your attack surface: It&#039;s minimal, hardened, and immutable.
  All API access is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
- **Predictability**: Talos eliminates configuration drift, reduces unknown factors by employing immutable infrastructure ideology, and delivers atomic updates.
- **Evolvability**: Talos simplifies your architecture, increases your agility, and always delivers current stable Kubernetes and Linux versions.

Build scalable games and apps with a production ready server used by ambitious game studios and app developers [all around the world](https://heroiclabs.com/customers/). Have a look at the [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs) and join the [developer community](https://forum.heroiclabs.com) for more info.

## Getting Started

The server is simple to setup and run for local development and can be deployed to any cloud provider. See the [deployment notes](#deployment) for recommendations on how to deploy the project for production. Nakama server requires CockroachDB or another Postgres wire-compatible server as it&#039;s database.

### Docker

&lt;a href=&quot;https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Docker_logo.svg&quot; width=&quot;170&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The fastest way to run the server and the database is with Docker. Setup Docker and start the daemon.

1. Set up a [docker-compose file](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/install/docker/#running-nakama) and place it in a folder for your project.

2. Run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up` to download container images and run the servers.

For more detailed instructions have a look at our [Docker quickstart](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/install/docker) guide.

Nakama Docker images are maintained on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama/tags) and [prerelease](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama-prerelease/tags) images are occasionally published for cutting edge features of the server.

### Binaries

You can run the servers with native binaries for your platform.

1. Download the server from our [releases](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases) page and the [database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb.html).

2. Follow the database [instructions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html#before-you-begin) to start it.

3. Run a migration which will setup or upgrade the database schema:

   ```shell
   nakama migrate up --database.address &quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;
   ```

4. Start Nakama and connect to the database:

   ```shell
   nakama --database.address &quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;
   ```

When connected you&#039;ll see server output which describes all settings the server uses for [configuration](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/configuration).

&gt; {&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;ts&quot;:&quot;2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;Node&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;nakama&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2.0.0+7e18b09&quot;,&quot;runtime&quot;:&quot;go1.10.1&quot;,&quot;cpu&quot;:4} &lt;br/&gt;
&gt; {&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;ts&quot;:&quot;2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;Database connections&quot;,&quot;dsns&quot;:[&quot;root@127.0.0.1:26257&quot;]} &lt;br/&gt;
&gt; ...

## Usage

Nakama supports a variety of protocols optimized for various gameplay or app use cases. For request/response it can use GRPC or the HTTP1.1+JSON fallback (REST). For realtime communication you can use WebSockets or rUDP.

For example with the REST API to authenticate a user account with a device identifier.

```shell
curl &quot;127.0.0.1:7350/v2/account/authenticate/device?create=true&quot; \
  --user &quot;defaultkey:&quot; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;someuniqueidentifier&quot;}&#039;
```

Response:

&gt; { &lt;br&gt;
&gt;     &quot;token&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjQ5OTU2NDksInVpZCI6Ijk5Y2Q1YzUyLWE5ODgtNGI2NC04YThhLTVmMTM5YTg4MTgxMiIsInVzbiI6InhBb1RxTUVSdFgifQ.-3_rXNYx3Q4jKuS7RkxeMWBzMNAm0vl93QxzRI8p_IY&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; }

There&#039;s a number of official [client libraries](https://github.com/heroiclabs) available on GitHub with [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs). The current platform/language support includes: .NET (in C#), Unity engine, JavaScript, Java (with Android), Unreal engine, Godot, Defold, and Swift (with iOS). If you&#039;d like to contribute a client or request one let us know.

## Nakama Console

The server provides a web UI which teams can use to inspect various data stored through the server APIs, view lightweight service metrics, manage player data, update storage objects, restrict access to production with permission profiles, and gain visibility into realtime features like active multiplayer matches. There is no separate installation required as it is embedded as part of the single server binary.

You can navigate to it on your browser on [http://127.0.0.1:7351](http://127.0.0.1:7351).

&lt;/details&gt;

## Deployment

Nakama can be deployed to any cloud provider such as Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, or your own private cloud. You should setup and provision separate nodes for Nakama and CockroachDB.

The recommended minimum production infrastructure for CockroachDB is outlined in [these docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/recommended-production-settings.html#basic-hardware-recommendations) and Nakama can be run on instance types as small as &quot;g1-small&quot; on Google Cloud although we recommend a minimum of &quot;n1-standard-1&quot; in production. The specific hardware requirements will depend on what features of the server are used. Reach out to us for help and advice on what servers to run.

### Heroic Cloud

You can support development, new features, and maintainance of the server by using the Heroic Labs&#039; [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) for deployment. This service handles the uptime, replication, backups, logs, data upgrades, and all other tasks involved with production server environments.

Have a look at our [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) service for more details.

## Contribute

The development roadmap is managed as GitHub issues and pull requests are welcome. If you&#039;re interested to add a feature which is not mentioned on the issue tracker please open one to create a discussion or drop in and discuss it in the [community forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com).

### Simple Builds

All dependencies required for a build are vendored as part of the Go project. We recommend a modern release of the Go toolchain and do not store the codebase in the old GOPATH.

1. Download the source tree.

   ```shell
   git clone &quot;https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama&quot; nakama
   cd nakama
   ```

2. Build the project from source.

   ```shell
   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor
   ./nakama --version
   ```

### Full Source Builds

The codebase uses Protocol Buffers, GRPC, GRPC-Gateway, and the OpenAPI spec as part of the project. These dependencies are generated as sources and committed to the repository to simplify builds for contributors.

To build the codebase and generate all sources follow these steps.

1. Install the toolchain.

   ```shell
   go install \
       &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot; \
       &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot; \
       &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot; \
       &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
   ```

2. Re-generate the protocol buffers and gateway code.

   ```shell
   buf generate apigrpc -o apigrpc
   buf generate console -o console
   ```

3. Build the codebase.

   ```shell
   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor
   ```

### Testing

In order to run all the unit and integration tests run:

```shell
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-tests.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit; docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-tests.yml down -v
```

This will create an isolated environment with Nakama and database instances, run
all the tests, and drop the environment afterwards.

`subfinder` is a subdomain discovery tool that returns valid subdomains for websites, using passive online sources. It has a simple, modular architecture and is optimized for speed. `subfinder` is built for
doing one thing only - passive subdomain enumeration, and it does that very well.

We have made it to comply with all the used passive source licenses and usage restrictions. The passive model guarantees speed and stealthiness that can be leveraged by both penetration testers and bug bounty
hunters alike.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](https://docs.ollama.com/import) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Generate embeddings from the CLI

```shell
ollama run embeddinggemma &quot;Your text to embed&quot;
```

You can also pipe text for scripted workflows:

```shell
echo &quot;Your text to embed&quot; | ollama run embeddinggemma
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. KEDA serves
as a Kubernetes Metrics Server and allows users to define autoscaling rules using a dedicated Kubernetes custom
resource definition.

KEDA can run on both the cloud and the edge, integrates natively with Kubernetes components such as the Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler, and has no external dependencies.

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.
