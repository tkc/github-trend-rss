## Why Kaiju?
The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at around 5,400 FPS on the same machine. In fact, a complete game, with audio, custom cursors, real time PBR rendering with real time shadows, UI, and more runs at 2,712 FPS (in &quot;debug&quot; mode) [screenshots or it didn&#039;t happen](https://x.com/ShieldCrush/status/1943516032674537958).

## Why Go (golang)?
I love C, and because I love C and found out that Ken Thompson played a part in designing Go, I gave Go a chance. It has been such a joy to use and work with I decided to port my C game engine to Go. Go is a modern system-level language that allows me to write code the way I want to write code and even have the opportunity to do some crazy things if I want to (no strings attached). Also the simplicity and &quot;just works&quot; of writing Assembly code was a great boost to my happiness.

What&#039;s more, it&#039;s a language that other developers can easily learn and jump right into extending the engine/editor. No need for developers to re-figure out some bespoke macros or crazy templating nonsense. It&#039;s flat, easy, straight forward, and the foot-gun is hidden behind some walls, but there if you want it. Furthermore, developers can write their games in Go directly, no need for some alternative language that is different from the engine code (but we&#039;ll include Lua for modding).

## What about the Garbage Collector?!
I am creating this section because I get asked about it when I mention &quot;Go&quot;, possibly not realizing that most public game engines use a garbage collector (GC).

The GC is actually a feature I&#039;m happy with (shocker coming from a C guy). Well, the reason is simple, if you&#039;re going to make a game engine that the public will use and needs to be stable, you need a garbage collector. Unity has C# (and possibly an internal GC as well), Unreal has a GC (and it could use a tune up if you ask me), Godot has a GC albeit their scripting language or when you use C#. It is actually very important for public engines to have a GC because people are only human and make a lot of mistakes, mistakes they&#039;ll blame on you (the engine developer) before they blame themselves.

Coincidentally, the overall design I have for the engine plays very well with the GC and last I measured, I have a net-0 heap allocation while running (may need a new review). If you don&#039;t abuse the GC, you shouldn&#039;t generally feel it, it runs concurrently as well.

I&#039;ll be the first to admit, I think the developers of Go can create a better GC than I can, and probably better than Unreal and Unity too.

## ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️
Though the engine is production ready, the editor **_is not_**, feel free to join and contribute to its development.

For the latest updates, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYj7Dh7ke3) or check my [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/ShieldCrush).

Please review the Ad-Hoc [editor readme](https://github.com/KaijuEngine/kaiju/blob/master/src/editor/README.md)

## Compiling the engine
&gt; **Windows developers must install the 64-bit Go toolchain (`windows-amd64`).**
&gt; The 32-bit (`windows-386`) Go distribution will not compile Kaiju’s Vulkan backend.
Please see the [documentation](https://kaijuengine.org/engine_developers/build_from_source/) on how to get started and compile the engine

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.

## Quick start

:information_source: For Kubernetes deployments, see [`examples/kubernetes`](./examples/kubernetes).

BuildKit is composed of the `buildkitd` daemon and the `buildctl` client.
While the `buildctl` client is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, the `buildkitd` daemon is only available for Linux and *Windows currently.

The latest binaries of BuildKit are available [here](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases) for Linux, macOS, and Windows.


### Linux Setup

The `buildkitd` daemon requires the following components to be installed:
-   [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) or [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun)
-   [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) (if you want to use containerd worker)

**Starting the `buildkitd` daemon:**
You need to run `buildkitd` as the root user on the host.

```bash
$ sudo buildkitd
```

To run `buildkitd` as a non-root user, see [`docs/rootless.md`](docs/rootless.md).

The buildkitd daemon supports two worker backends: OCI (runc) and containerd.

By default, the OCI (runc) worker is used. You can set `--oci-worker=false --containerd-worker=true` to use the containerd worker.

We are open to adding more backends.

To start the buildkitd daemon using systemd socket activation, you can install the buildkit systemd unit files.
See [Systemd socket activation](#systemd-socket-activation)

The buildkitd daemon listens gRPC API on `/run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock` by default, but you can also use TCP sockets.
See [Expose BuildKit as a TCP service](#expose-buildkit-as-a-tcp-service).

### Windows Setup

See instructions and notes at [`docs/windows.md`](./docs/windows.md).

### macOS Setup

[Homebrew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/buildkit) (unofficial) is available for macOS.
```console
$ brew install buildkit
```

The Homebrew formula does not contain the daemon (`buildkitd`).

For example, [Lima](https://lima-vm.io) can be used for launching the daemon inside a Linux VM.
```console
brew install lima
limactl start template://buildkit
export BUILDKIT_HOST=&quot;unix://$HOME/.lima/buildkit/sock/buildkitd.sock&quot;
```

### Build from source

To build BuildKit from source, see [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For a `buildctl` reference, see [this document](./docs/reference/buildctl.md).

### Exploring LLB

BuildKit builds are based on a binary intermediate format called LLB that is used for defining the dependency graph for processes running part of your build. tl;dr: LLB is to Dockerfile what LLVM IR is to C.

-   Marshaled as Protobuf messages
-   Concurrently executable
-   Efficiently cacheable
-   Vendor-neutral (i.e. non-Dockerfile languages can be easily implemented)

See [`solver/pb/ops.proto`](./solver/pb/ops.proto) for the format definition, and see [`./examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md) for example LLB applications.

Currently, the following high-level languages have been implemented for LLB:

-   Dockerfile (See [Exploring Dockerfiles](#exploring-dockerfiles))
-   [Buildpacks](https://github.com/tonistiigi/buildkit-pack)
-   [Mockerfile](https://matt-rickard.com/building-a-new-dockerfile-frontend/)
-   [Gockerfile](https://github.com/po3rin/gockerfile)
-   [bldr (Pkgfile)](https://github.com/talos-systems/bldr/)
-   [HLB](https://github.com/openllb/hlb)
-   [Earthfile (Earthly)](https://github.com/earthly/earthly)
-   [Cargo Wharf (Rust)](https://github.com/denzp/cargo-wharf)
-   [Nix](https://github.com/reproducible-containers/buildkit-nix)
-   [mopy (Python)](https://github.com/cmdjulian/mopy)
-   [envd (starlark)](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd/)
-   [Blubber](https://gitlab.wikimedia.org/repos/releng/blubber)
-   [Bass](https://github.com/vito/bass)
-   [kraft.yaml (Unikraft)](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/tree/staging/tools/dockerfile-llb-frontend)
-   [r2d4/llb (JSON Gateway)](https://github.com/r2d4/llb)
-   [Massé](https://github.com/marxarelli/masse)
-   [DALEC](https://github.com/project-dalec/dalec)
-   (open a PR to add your own language)

### Exploring Dockerfiles

Frontends are components that run inside BuildKit and convert any build definition to LLB. There is a special frontend called gateway (`gateway.v0`) that allows using any image as a frontend.

During development, Dockerfile frontend (`dockerfile.v0`) is also part of the BuildKit repo. In the future, this will be moved out, and Dockerfiles can be built using an external image.

#### Building a Dockerfile with `buildctl`

```bash
buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=.
# or
buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=. \
    --opt target=foo \
    --opt build-arg:foo=bar
```

`--local` exposes local source files from client to the builder. `context` and `dockerfile` are the names Dockerfile frontend looks for build context and Dockerfile location.

If the Dockerfile has a different filename it can be specified with `--opt filename=./Dockerfile-alternative`.

#### Building a Dockerfile using external frontend

External versions of the Dockerfile frontend are pushed to https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/dockerfile-upstream and https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/dockerfile and can be used with the gateway frontend. The source for the external frontend is currently located in `./frontend/dockerfile/cmd/dockerfile-frontend` but will move out of this repository in the future ([#163](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/163)). For automatic build from master branch of this repository `docker/dockerfile-upstream:master` or `docker/dockerfile-upstream:master-labs` image can be used.

```bash
buildctl build \
    --frontend gateway.v0 \
    --opt source=docker/dockerfile \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=.
buildctl build \
    --frontend gateway.v0 \
    --opt source=docker/dockerfile \
    --opt context=https://github.com/moby/moby.git \
    --opt build-arg:APT_MIRROR=cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org
```

### Output

By default, the build result and intermediate cache will only remain internally in BuildKit. An output needs to be specified to retrieve the result.

#### Image/Registry

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true
```

To export the image to multiple registries:

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=image,\&quot;name=docker.io/username/image,docker.io/username2/image2\&quot;,push=true
```

To export the cache embed with the image and pushing them to registry together, type `registry` is required to import the cache, you should specify `--export-cache type=inline` and `--import-cache type=registry,ref=...`. To export the cache to a local directly, you should specify `--export-cache type=local`.
Details in [Export cache](#export-cache).

```bash
buildctl build ...\
  --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true \
  --export-cache type=inline \
  --import-cache type=registry,ref=docker.io/username/image
```

Keys supported by image output:
* `name=&lt;value&gt;`: specify image name(s)
* `push=true`: push after creating the image
* `push-by-digest=true`: push unnamed image
* `registry.insecure=true`: push to insecure HTTP registry
* `oci-mediatypes=true`: use OCI mediatypes in configuration JSON instead of Docker&#039;s
* `oci-artifact=false`: use OCI artifact format for attestations
* `unpack=true`: unpack image after creation (for use with containerd)
* `dangling-name-prefix=&lt;value&gt;`: name image with `prefix@&lt;digest&gt;`, used for anonymous images
* `name-canonical=true`: add additional canonical name `name@&lt;digest&gt;`
* `compression=&lt;uncompressed|gzip|estargz|zstd&gt;`: choose compression type for layers newly created and cached, gzip is default value. estargz should be used with `oci-mediatypes=true`.
* `compression-level=&lt;value&gt;`: compression level for gzip, estargz (0-9) and zstd (0-22)
* `rewrite-timestamp=true`: rewrite the file timestamps to the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` value.
   See [`docs/build-repro.md`](docs/build-repro.md) for how to specify the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` value.
* `force-compression=true`: forcefully apply `compression` option to all layers (including already existing layers)
* `store=true`: store the result images to the worker&#039;s (e.g. containerd) image store as well as ensures that the image has all blobs in the content store (default `true`). Ignored if the worker doesn&#039;t have image store (e.g. OCI worker).
* `annotation.&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`: attach an annotation with the respective `key` and `value` to the built image
  * Using the extended syntaxes, `annotation-&lt;type&gt;.&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`, `annotation[&lt;platform&gt;].&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;` and both combined with `annotation-&lt;type&gt;[&lt;platform&gt;].&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`, allows configuring exactly where to attach the annotation.
  * `&lt;type&gt;` specifies what object to attach to, and can be any of `manifest` (the default), `manifest-descriptor`, `index` and `index-descriptor`
  * `&lt;platform&gt;` specifies which objects to attach to (by default, all), and is the same key passed into the `platform` opt, see [`docs/multi-platform.md`](docs/multi-platform.md).
  * See [`docs/annotations.md`](docs/annotations.md) for more details.

If credentials are required, `buildctl` will attempt to read Docker configuration file `$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json`.
`$DOCKER_CONFIG` defaults to `~/.docker`.

#### Local directory

The local client will copy the files directly to the client. This is useful if BuildKit is being used for building something else than container images.

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=local,dest=path/to/output-dir
```

To export specific files use multi-stage builds with a scratch stage and copy the needed files into that stage with `COPY --from`.

```dockerfile
...
FROM scratch as testresult

COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/testresult.xml .
...
```

```bash
buildctl build ... --opt target=testresult --output type=local,dest=path/to/output-dir
```

With a [multi-platform build](docs/multi-platform.md), a subfolder matching
each target platform will be created in the destination directory:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox AS build
ARG TARGETOS
ARG TARGETARCH
RUN mkdir /out &amp;&amp; echo foo &gt; /out/hello-$TARGETOS-$TARGETARCH

FROM scratch
COPY --from=build /out /
```

```bash
$ buildctl build \
  --frontend dockerfile.v0 \
  --opt platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --output type=local,dest=./bin/release

$ tree ./bin
./bin/
└── release
    ├── linux_amd64
    │   └── hello-linux-amd64
    └── linux_arm64
        └── hello-linux-arm64
```

You can set `platform-split=false` to merge files from all platforms together
into same directory:

```bash
$ buildctl build \
  --frontend dockerfile.v0 \
  --opt platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --output type=local,dest=./bin/release,platform-split=false

$ tree ./bin
./bin/
└── release
    ├── hello-linux-amd64
    └── hello-linux-arm64
```

Tar exporter is similar to local exporter but transfers the files through a tarball.

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=tar,dest=out.tar
buildctl build ... --output type=tar &gt; out.tar
```

#### Docker tarball

```bash
# exported tarball is also compatible with OCI spec
buildctl build ... --output type=docker,name=myimage | docker load
```

#### OCI tarball

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=oci,dest=path/to/output.tar
buildctl build ... --output type=oci &gt; output.tar
```

#### containerd image store

The containerd worker needs to be used

```bash
buildctl build ... --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image
ctr --namespace=buildkit images ls
```

To change the containerd namespace, you need to change `worker.containerd.namespace` in [`/etc/buildkit/buildkitd.toml`](./docs/buildkitd.toml.md).

## Cache

To show local build cache (`/var/lib/buildkit`):

```bash
buildctl du -v
```

To prune local build cache:
```bash
buildctl prune
```

### Garbage collection

See [`./docs/buildkitd.toml.md`](./docs/buildkitd.toml.md).

### Export cache

BuildKit supports the following cache exporters:
* `inline`: embed the cache into the image, and push them to the registry together
* `registry`: push the image and the cache separately
* `local`: export to a local directory
* `gha`: export to GitHub Actions cache

In most case you want to use the `inline` cache exporter.
However, note that the `inline` cache exporter only supports `min` cache mode. 
To enable `max` cache mode, push the image and the cache separately by using `registry` cache exporter.

`inline` and `registry` exporters both store the cache in the registry. For importing the cache, `type=registry` is sufficient for both, as specifying the cache format is not necessary.

#### Inline (push image and cache together)

```bash
buildctl build ... \
  --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true \
  --export-cache type=inline \
  --import-cache type=registry,ref=docker.io/username/image
```

Note that the inline cache is not imported unless [`--import-cache type=registry,ref=...`](#registry-push-image-and-cache-separately) is provided.

Inline cache embeds cache metadata into the image config. The layers in the image will be left untouched compared to the image with no cache information.

:information_source: Docker-integrated BuildKit (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build`) and `docker buildx`requires 
`--build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1` to be specified to enable the `inline` cache exporter.
However, the standalone `buildctl` does NOT require `--opt build-arg:BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1` and the build-arg is simply ignored.

#### Registry (push image and cache separately)

```bash
buildctl build ... \
  --output type=image,name=localhost:5000/myrepo:image,push=true \
  --export-cache type=registry,ref=localhost:5000/myrepo:buildcache \
  --import-cache type=registry,ref=localhost:5000/myrepo:buildcache
```

`--export-cache` options:
* `type=registry`
* `mode=&lt;min|max&gt;`: specify cache layers to export (default: `min`)
  * `min`: only export layers for the resulting image
  * `max`: export all the layers of all intermediate steps
* `ref=&lt;ref&gt;`: specify repository re

## 🔧 Initialization Configuration Guide

To help users quickly configure various models and reduce trial-and-error costs, we&#039;ve improved the original configuration file initialization method by adding a Web UI interface for model configuration. Before using, please ensure the code is updated to the latest version. The specific steps are as follows:
If this is your first time using this project, you can skip steps ①② and go directly to steps ③④.

### ① Stop the services

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh --stop
```

### ② Clear existing data tables (recommended when no important data exists)

```bash
make clean-db
```

### ③ Compile and start services

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh
```

### ④ Access Web UI

http://localhost

On your first visit, you will be automatically redirected to the registration/login page. After completing registration, please create a new knowledge base and finish the relevant settings on its configuration page.

## 📱 Interface Showcase

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

**Knowledge Base Management:** Support for creating FAQ and document knowledge base types, with multiple import methods including drag-and-drop, folder import, and URL import. Automatically identifies document structures and extracts core knowledge to establish indexes. Supports tag management and online entry. The system clearly displays processing progress and document status, achieving efficient knowledge base management.

**Agent Mode:** Support for ReACT Agent mode that can use built-in tools to retrieve knowledge bases, call user-configured MCP tools and web search tools to access external services, providing comprehensive summary reports through multiple iterations and reflection. Supports cross-knowledge base retrieval, allowing selection of multiple knowledge bases for simultaneous retrieval.

**Conversation Strategy:** Support for configuring Agent models, normal mode models, retrieval thresholds, and online Prompt configuration, with precise control over multi-turn conversation behavior and retrieval execution methods. The conversation input box supports Agent mode/normal mode switching, enabling/disabling web search, and selecting conversation models.

### Document Knowledge Graph

WeKnora supports transforming documents into knowledge graphs, displaying the relationships between different sections of the documents. Once the knowledge graph feature is enabled, the system analyzes and constructs an internal semantic association network that not only helps users understand document content but also provides structured support for indexing and retrieval, enhancing the relevance and breadth of search results.

For detailed configuration, please refer to the [Knowledge Graph Configuration Guide](./docs/KnowledgeGraph.md).

### MCP Server

Please refer to the [MCP Configuration Guide](./mcp-server/MCP_CONFIG.md) for the necessary setup.

## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don&#039;t need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Method 1: Using Make commands (Recommended)
make dev-start      # Start infrastructure
make dev-app        # Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend (new terminal)

# Method 2: One-click start
./scripts/quick-dev.sh

# Method 3: Using scripts
./scripts/dev.sh start     # Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev.sh app       # Start backend (new terminal)
./scripts/dev.sh frontend  # Start frontend (new terminal)
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging

[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/?ref=github-inngest-readme)&#039;s durable functions replace queues, state management, and scheduling to enable any developer to write reliable step functions faster without touching infrastructure.

1. Write durable functions using any of [**our language SDKs**](#sdks)
2. Run the [**Inngest Dev Server**](#getting-started) for a complete local development experience, with production parity.
3. Deploy your functions to your own infrastructure
4. Sync your application&#039;s functions with the [**Inngest Platform**](https://www.inngest.com/?ref=github-inngest-readme) or a [self-hosted Inngest server](#self-hosting).
5. Inngest invokes your functions securely via HTTPS whenever triggering events are received.

### An example durable function

Inngest Functions enable developers to run reliable background logic, from background jobs to complex workflows. An Inngest Function is composed of three key parts that provide robust support for retrying, scheduling, and coordinating complex sequences of operations:

- [**Triggers**](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Events, Cron schedules or webhook events that trigger the function.
- [**Flow Control**](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Configure how the function runs are enqueued and executed including concurrency, throttling, debouncing, rate limiting, and prioritization.
- [**Steps**](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Steps are fundamental building blocks of Inngest, turning your Inngest Functions into reliable workflows that can runs for months and recover from failures.

Here is an example function that limits concurrency for each unique user id and performs two steps that will be retried on error:

```typescript
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: &quot;import-product-images&quot;,
    concurrency: {
      key: &quot;event.data.userId&quot;,
      limit: 10
    }
  },
  { event: &quot;shop/product.imported&quot; },
  async ({ event, step }) =&gt; {
    // Here goes the business logic
    // By wrapping code in steps, each will be retried automatically on failure
    const s3Urls = await step.run(&quot;copy-images-to-s3&quot;, async () =&gt; {
      return copyAllImagesToS3(event.data.imageURLs);
    });
    // You can include numerous steps in your function
    await step.run(&quot;resize-images&quot;, async () =&gt; {
      await resizer.bulk({ urls: s3Urls, quality: 0.9, maxWidth: 1024 });
    })
  };
);

// Elsewhere in your code (e.g. in your API endpoint):
await inngest.send({
  name: &quot;shop/product.imported&quot;,
  data: {
    userId: &quot;01J8G44701QYGE0DH65PZM8DPM&quot;,
    imageURLs: [
      &quot;https://useruploads.acme.com/q2345678/1094.jpg&quot;,
      &quot;https://useruploads.acme.com/q2345678/1095.jpg&quot;
    ],
  },
});
```

## Project Architecture

To understand how self-hosting works, it&#039;s valuable to understand the architecture and system components at a high level. We&#039;ll take a look at a simplified architecture diagram and walk through the system.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/architecture-2024-09-23.png&quot; alt=&quot;System Architecture&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- **Event API** - Receives events from SDKs via HTTP requests. Authenticates client requests via [Event Keys](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events/creating-an-event-key?ref=github-inngest-readme). The Event API publishes event payloads to an internal event stream.
- **Event stream** - Acts as buffer between the _Event API_ and the _Runner_.
- **Runner** - Consumes incoming events and performs several actions:
  - Scheduling of new “function runs” (aka jobs) given the event type, creating initial run state in the _State store_ database. Runs are added to queues given the function&#039;s flow control configuration.
  - Resume functions paused via [`waitForEvent`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/wait-for-event?ref=github-inngest-readme) with matching expressions.
  - Cancels running functions with matching [`cancelOn`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancellation/cancel-on-events?ref=github-inngest-readme) expressions
  - Writes ingested events to a database for historical record and future replay.
- **Queue** - A multi-tenant aware, multi-tier queue designed for fairness and various [flow control](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control?ref=github-inngest-readme) methods (concurrency, throttling, prioritization, debouncing, rate limiting) and [batching](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/batching?ref=github-inngest-readme).
- **Executor** - Responsible for executing functions, from initial execution, step execution, writing incremental function run state to the _State store_, and retries after failures.
- **State store (database)** - Persists data for pending and ongoing function runs. Data includes initial triggering event(s), step output and step errors.
- **Database** - Persists system data and history including Apps, Functions, Events, Function run results.
- **API** - GraphQL and REST APIs for programmatic access and management of system resources.
- **Dashboard UI** - The UI to manage apps, functions and view function run history.

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to
receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need
to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support
open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to
multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

Objectives:

- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.
- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.
- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.
- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.
- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.

## Community

The OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)
channel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via
video calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:

- meet the humans behind the project
- get an opinion about specific proposals
- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack
- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously

We rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to
allow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:

Tuesday:

- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)

Wednesday:

- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)
- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)

Contributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.
Post a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong
reasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to
identify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.

Remember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the
relevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull
request where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous
calls and don&#039;t want them to feel excluded.

## Supported OTLP version

This code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,
considered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability
definition
here.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)

## Stability levels

See [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.

## Compatibility

When used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.

Support for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:

1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.
2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.

Official OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.

## Verifying the images signatures

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.

We are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:

```console
$ cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt; \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  &lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;
```

where:

- `&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt;`: is the release that you want to validate
- `&lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;`: is the image that you want to check

Example:

```console
$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0

Verification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates

            <h2>README</h2><pre># MCP Registry

The MCP registry provides MCP clients with a list of MCP servers, like an app store for MCP servers.

[**📤 Publish my MCP server**](docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/quickstart.mdx) | [**⚡️ Live API docs**](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/docs) | [**👀 Ecosystem vision**](docs/design/ecosystem-vision.md) | 📖 **[Full documentation](./docs)**

## Development Status

**2025-10-24 update**: The Registry API has entered an **API freeze (v0.1)** 🎉. For the next month or more, the API will remain stable with no breaking changes, allowing integrators to confidently implement support. This freeze applies to v0.1 while development continues on v0. We&#039;ll use this period to validate the API in real-world integrations and gather feedback to shape v1 for general availability. Thank you to everyone for your contributions and patience—your involvement has been key to getting us here!

**2025-09-08 update**: The registry has launched in preview 🎉 ([announcement blog post](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-09-08-mcp-registry-preview/)). While the system is now more stable, this is still a preview release and breaking changes or data resets may occur. A general availability (GA) release will follow later. We&#039;d love your feedback in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/discussions/new?category=ideas) or in the [#registry-dev Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1358869848138059966/1369487942862504016) ([joining details here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication)).

## Contributing

We use multiple channels for collaboration - see [modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication).

Often (but not always) ideas flow through this pipeline:

- **[Discord](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication)** - Real-time community discussions
- **[Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/discussions)** - Propose and discuss product/technical requirements
- **[Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/issues)** - Track well-scoped technical work  
- **[Pull Requests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/pulls)** - Contribute work towards issues

### Quick start:

#### Pre-requisites

- **Docker**
- **Go 1.24.x**
- **ko** - Container image builder for Go ([installation instructions](https://ko.build/install/))
- **golangci-lint v2.4.0**

#### Running the server

```bash
# Start full development environment
make dev-compose
```

This starts the registry at [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) with PostgreSQL. The database uses ephemeral storage and is reset each time you restart the containers, ensuring a clean state for development and testing.

**Note:** The registry uses [ko](https://ko.build) to build container images. The `make dev-compose` command automatically builds the registry image with ko and loads it into your local Docker daemon before starting the services.

By default, the registry seeds from the production API with a filtered subset of servers (to keep startup fast). This ensures your local environment mirrors production behavior and all seed data passes validation. For offline development you can seed from a file without validation with `MCP_REGISTRY_SEED_FROM=data/seed.json MCP_REGISTRY_ENABLE_REGISTRY_VALIDATION=false make dev-compose`.

The setup can be configured with environment variables in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) - see [.env.example](./.env.example) for a reference.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Alternative: Running a pre-built Docker image&lt;/summary&gt;

Pre-built Docker images are automatically published to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Run latest stable release
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:latest

# Run latest from main branch (continuous deployment)
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:main

# Run specific release version
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:v1.0.0

# Run development build from main branch
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:main-20250906-abc123d
```

**Available tags:** 
- **Releases**: `latest`, `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.
- **Continuous**: `main` (latest main branch build)
- **Development**: `main-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;sha&gt;` (specific commit builds)

&lt;/details&gt;

#### Publishing a server

To publish a server, we&#039;ve built a simple CLI. You can use it with:

```bash
# Build the latest CLI
make publisher

# Use it!
./bin/mcp-publisher --help
```

See [the publisher guide](./docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/quickstart.mdx) for more details.

#### Other commands

```bash
# Run lint, unit tests and integration tests
make check
```

There are also a few more helpful commands for development. Run `make help` to learn more, or look in [Makefile](./Makefile).

&lt;!--
For Claude and other AI tools: Always prefer make targets over custom commands where possible.

```

### Authentication

Publishing supports multiple authentication methods:
- **GitHub OAuth** - For publishing by logging into GitHub
- **GitHub OIDC** - For publishing from GitHub Actions
- **DNS verification** - For proving ownership of a domain and its subdomains
- **HTTP verification** - For proving ownership of a domain

The registry validates namespace ownership when publishing. E.g. to publish...:
- `io.github.domdomegg/my-cool-mcp` you must login to GitHub as `domdomegg`, or be in a GitHub Action on domdomegg&#039;s repos
- `me.adamjones/my-cool-mcp` you must prove ownership of `adamjones.me` via DNS or HTTP challenge

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 5.9. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 5.9 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | done | Done, though `tsconfig` errors may not be as helpful. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 5.9. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 5.9. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | in progress | Mostly complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit not complete. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled. |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps. |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Most functionality. More features coming soon. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.9, see CHANGES.md.

国外很多网站都在使用 Cloudflare CDN，但分配给中国内地访客的 IP 并不友好（延迟高、丢包多、速度慢）。  
虽然 Cloudflare 公开了所有 [IP 段](https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/ips/) ，但想要在这么多 IP 中找到适合自己的，怕是要累死，于是就有了这个软件。

## \# 快速使用

### 下载运行

1. 下载编译好的可执行文件（ [Github Releases](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases) / [蓝奏云](https://xiu.lanzoub.com/b0742hkxe) ）并解压。  
2. 双击运行 `cfst.exe` 文件（Windows 系统），等待测速完成...

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击查看 Windows 系统下其他安装方式」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

如果你有 scoop(Windows 下的命令行安装程序)，则可以这样安装:

```sh
# 添加最多人使用的中文软件包仓库：dorado
scoop bucket add dorado https://github.com/chawyehsu/dorado
# 安装cloudflare-speedtest
scoop install dorado/cloudflare-speedtest
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击查看 Linux 系统下的使用示例 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

以下命令仅为示例，版本号和文件名请前往 [**Releases**](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases) 查看。

``` yaml
# 如果是第一次使用，则建议创建新文件夹（后续更新时，跳过该步骤）
mkdir cfst

# 进入文件夹（后续更新，只需要从这里重复下面的下载、解压命令即可）
cd cfst

# 下载 CFST 压缩包（自行根据需求替换 URL 中 [版本号] 和 [文件名]）
wget -N https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_amd64.tar.gz
# 如果你是在国内网络环境中下载，那么请使用下面这几个镜像加速之一：
# wget -N https://ghfast.top/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz
# wget -N https://wget.la/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz
# wget -N https://ghproxy.net/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz

# wget -N https://hk.gh-proxy.com/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz
# 如果下载失败的话，尝试删除 -N 参数（如果是为了更新，则记得提前删除旧压缩包 rm cfst_linux_amd64.tar.gz ）

# 解压（不需要删除旧文件，会直接覆盖，自行根据需求替换 文件名）
tar -zxf cfst_linux_amd64.tar.gz

# 赋予执行权限
chmod +x cfst

# 运行（不带参数）
./cfst

# 运行（带参数示例）
./cfst -tl 200 -dn 20
```

&gt; 如果平**均延迟非常低**（如 0.xx），则说明 CFST **测速时走了代理**，请先关闭代理软件后再测速。  
&gt; 如果在**路由器**上运行，建议先关闭路由器内的代理（或将其排除），否则测速结果可能会**不准确/无法使用**。

&lt;/details&gt;

### 结果示例

测速完毕后，默认会显示**最快的 10 个 IP**，示例（仅为输出内容示例）：

# 如果平均延迟非常低（如 0.xx），则说明 CFST 测速时走了代理，请先关闭代理软件后再测速。
# 如果在路由器上运行，请先关闭路由器内的代理（或将其排除），否则测速结果可能会不准确/无法使用。

# 因为每次测速都是在每个 IP 段中随机 IP，所以每次的测速结果都不可能相同，这是正常的！

# 注意！我发现电脑开机后第一次测速延迟会明显偏高（手动 TCPing 也一样），后续测速都正常
# 因此建议大家开机后第一次正式测速前，先随便测几个 IP（无需等待延迟测速完成，只要进度条动了就可以直接关了）

# 软件在 默认参数 下的整个流程大概步骤：
# 1. 延迟测速（默认 TCPing 模式，HTTPing 模式需要手动加上参数）
# 2. 延迟排序（延迟 从低到高 排序并按条件过滤，不同丢包率会分开排序，因此可能会有一些延迟低但丢包的 IP 排到后面）
# 3. 下载测速（从延迟最低的 IP 开始依次下载测速，默认测够 10 个就会停止）
# 4. 速度排序（速度从高到低排序）
# 5. 输出结果（通过参数控制是否输出到命令行(-p 0)或输出到文件(-o &quot;&quot;)）

# 注意：输出的结果文件 result.csv 通过微软 Excel 表格打开会中文乱码，这是正常的，其他表格软件/记事本都显示正常
```

测速结果第一行就是**既下载速度最快、又平均延迟最低的最快 IP**！

完整结果保存在当前目录下的 `result.csv` 文件中，用**记事本/表格软件**打开，格式如下：

```
IP 地址,已发送,已接收,丢包率,平均延迟,下载速度(MB/s),地区码
104.27.200.69,4,4,0.00,146.23,28.64,LAX
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; _如果你发现**下载速度为 0.00**，那么可以用**调试模式 `-debug`** 排查一下，详见：[**# 下载测速都是 0.00 ？**](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest#-%E4%B8%8B%E8%BD%BD%E6%B5%8B%E9%80%9F%E9%83%BD%E6%98%AF-000-)_

&gt; _大家可以按自己需求，对完整结果**进一步筛选处理**，或者去看一看进阶使用**指定过滤条件**！_

****
## \# 进阶使用

直接运行使用的是默认参数，如果想要测速结果更全面、更符合自己的要求，可以自定义参数。

```Dart
C:\&gt;cfst.exe -h

CloudflareSpeedTest vX.X.X
测试各个 CDN 或网站所有 IP 的延迟和速度，获取最快 IP (IPv4+IPv6)！
https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest

参数：
    -n 200
        延迟测速线程；越多延迟测速越快，性能弱的设备 (如路由器) 请勿太高；(默认 200 最多 1000)
    -t 4
        延迟测速次数；单个 IP 延迟测速的次数；(默认 4 次)
    -dn 10
        下载测速数量；延迟测速并排序后，从最低延迟起下载测速的数量；(默认 10 个)
    -dt 10
        下载测速时间；单个 IP 下载测速最长时间，不能太短；(默认 10 秒)
    -tp 443
        指定测速端口；延迟测速/下载测速时使用的端口；(默认 443 端口)
    -url https://cf.xiu2.xyz/url
        指定测速地址；延迟测速(HTTPing)/下载测速时使用的地址，默认地址不保证可用性，建议自建；
        当下载测速时，软件会从 HTTP 响应头中获取该 IP 当前地区码（支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN）并显示出来。

    -httping
        切换测速模式；延迟测速模式改为 HTTP 协议，所用测试地址为 [-url] 参数；(默认 TCPing)
        当使用 HTTP 测速模式时，软件会从 HTTP 响应头中获取该 IP 当前地区码（支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN）并显示出来。
        注意：HTTPing 本质上也算一种 网络扫描 行为，因此如果你在服务器上面运行，需要降低并发(-n)，否则可能会被一些严格的商家暂停服务。
        如果你遇到 HTTPing 首次测速可用 IP 数量正常，后续测速越来越少甚至直接为 0，但停一段时间后又恢复了的情况，那么也可能是被 运营商、Cloudflare CDN 认为你在网络扫描而 触发临时限制机制，因此才会过一会儿就恢复了，建议降低并发(-n)减少这种情况的发生。
    -httping-code 200
        有效状态代码；HTTPing 延迟测速时网页返回的有效 HTTP 状态码，仅限一个；(默认 200 301 302)
    -cfcolo HKG,KHH,NRT,LAX,SEA,SJC,FRA,MAD
        匹配指定地区；IATA 机场地区码或国家/城市码，英文逗号分隔，大小写均可，仅 HTTPing 模式可用；(默认 所有地区)
        支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN
        其中 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly 使用的是 IATA 三字机场地区码，如：HKG,LAX
        其中 CDN77、Bunny 使用的是 二字国家/区域码，如：US,CN
        其中 Gcore 使用的是 二字城市码，如：FR,AM
        因此大家使用 -cfcolo 指定地区码时要根据不同的 CDN 来指定不同类型的地区码。

    -tl 200
        平均延迟上限；只输出低于指定平均延迟的 IP，各上下限条件可搭配使用；(默认 9999 ms)
    -tll 40
        平均延迟下限；只输出高于指定平均延迟的 IP；(默认 0 ms)
    -tlr 0.2
        丢包几率上限；只输出低于/等于指定丢包率的 IP，范围 0.00~1.00，0 过滤掉任何丢包的 IP；(默认 1.00)
    -sl 5
        下载速度下限；只输出高于指定下载速度的 IP，凑够指定数量 [-dn] 才会停止测速；(默认 0.00 MB/s)

    -p 10
        显示结果数量；测速后直接显示指定数量的结果，为 0 时不显示结果直接退出；(默认 10 个)
    -f ip.txt
        IP段数据文件；如路径含有空格请加上引号；支持其他 CDN IP段；(默认 ip.txt)
    -ip 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2/24,2606:4700::/32
        指定IP段数据；直接通过参数指定要测速的 IP 段数据，英文逗号分隔；(默认 空)
    -o result.csv
        写入结果文件；如路径含有空格请加上引号；值为空时不写入文件 [-o &quot;&quot;]；(默认 result.csv)
        注意：在一些环境下使用 -o &quot;&quot; 可能会被忽略掉这个空参数导致报错，可加个空格 -o &quot; &quot; 解决

    -dd
        禁用下载测速；禁用后测速结果会按延迟排序 (默认按下载速度排序)；(默认 启用)
    -allip
        测速全部的IP；对 IP 段中的每个 IP (仅支持 IPv4) 进行测速；(默认 每个 /24 段随机测速一个 IP)

    -debug
        调试输出模式；会在一些非预期情况下输出更多日志以便判断原因；(默认 关闭)
        目前该功能仅针对 HTTPing 延迟测速过程 及 下载测速过程，当过程中因为各种原因导致当前 IP 测速中断都会输出错误原因
        例如：HTTPing 延迟测速过程中，因为 HTTP 状态码不符合或测速地址有问题或超时等原因而终止测速
        例如：下载测速过程中，因为下载测速地址有问题（被阻断、403状态码、超时）等原因而终止测速（导致显示 0.00）

&gt; 刚接触 CFST 的人，可能会迷惑**明明延迟测速可用 IP 有 30 个，怎么最后只剩下 3 个了呢？**  
&gt; 下载测速里的队列又是什么意思？难道我下载测速还要排队？

CFST 会先延迟测速，在这过程中进度条右侧会实时显示可用 IP 数量（`可用: 30`），但注意该可用数量指的是**测试通过没有超时的 IP 数量**，和延迟上下限、丢包条件无关。当延迟测速完成后，因为还指定了**延迟上下限、丢包**的条件，所以按照条件过滤后只剩下 `10` 个了（也就是等待下载测速的 `队列：10`）。

即以上示例中，`321` 个 IP 延迟测速完成后，只有 `30` 个 IP 测试通过没有超时，然后根据延迟上下限范围：`40 ~ 150 ms` 及丢包上限条件过滤后，只剩下 `10` 个满足要求的 IP 了。如果你 `-dd` 禁用了下载测速，那么就会直接输出这 `10` 个 IP 了。当然该示例并未禁用，因此接下来软件会继续对这 `10` 个 IP 进行下载测速（`队列：10`）。

&gt; 因为下载测速是单线程一个个 IP 挨着排队测速的，因此等待下载测速的 IP 数量才会叫做 `队列`。

****

&gt; 你可能注意到了，**明明指定了要找到 5 个满足下载速度条件的 IP，怎么才 3 个就 “中断” 了呢？**

下载测速进度条中的 `3 / 5`，前者指的是找到了 `3` 个满足下载速度下限条件的 IP（即下载速度高于 `1 MB/s` ），后者 `5` 指的是你要求找到 `5` 个满足下载速度下限条件的 IP（`-dn 5`）。

&gt; 另外，提醒一下，如果你指定的 `-dn` 大于下载测速队列，比如你延迟测速后只剩下 `4` 个 IP 了，那么下载测速进度条中后面的数字就会和下载测速队列一样都是 `4` 个，而非你 `-dn` 指定的 `5` 个了。

软件在测速完这 `10` 个 IP 后，只找到了 `3` 个下载速度高于 `1 MB/s` 的 IP，剩下的 `7` 个 IP 都是 “不及格” 的。

因此，这不是 `“每次测速都不到 5 就中断了”`，而是所有 IP 都下载测速完了，但却只找到了 `3` 个满足条件的。

****

还有一种情况，那就是当可用 IP 很多时（几百几千），你还设置了下载速度条件，那么可能就会遇到：**怎么下载测速进度条老是卡在 `X / 5` 了呢？**

这其实并不是卡住了，而是只有当找到一个满足条件的 IP 时，进度条才会 +1，因此如果一直找不到，那么 CFST 就会一直下载测速下去，因此在表现为进度条卡住不动，但这也是在提醒你：你设置的下载速度条件对你来说已经高于实际了，你需要适当调低预期。

****

如果不想遇到这种全部测速一遍都没几个满足条件的情况，那么就要**调低下载速度上限参数 `-sl`**，或者移除。

因为只要指定了 `-sl` 参数，那么只要没有凑够 `-dn` 的数量（默认 10 个），就会一直测速下去，直到凑够或全部测速完。移除 `-sl` 并添加 `-dn 20` 参数，这样就是只测速延迟最低的前 20 个 IP，测速完就停止，节省时间。

****

另外，如果全部队列 IP 都测速完了，但一个满足下载速度条件的 IP 都没有，你可能需要调低预期的下载测速下限条件，但你需要知道当前的大概测速速度都在什么范围，那么你就可以加上 `-debug` 参数开启调试模式，这样再遇到这种情况时，就会**忽略条件返回所有测速结果**，你就能看到这些 IP 的下载速度都有多少，心里也就有数了，然后**适当调低 `-sl` 再试试**。

&gt; 注意，如果你**没有指定**下载测速下限 `-sl` 条件，那么无论什么情况下 CFST 都会**输出所有测速结果**。

同样，延迟测速方面，`可用: 30`、`队列：10` 这两个数值也可以让你清楚，你设置的延迟条件对你来说是否过于苛刻。如果可用 IP 一大堆，但条件过滤后只剩下 2、3 个，那不用说就知道需要**调低预期的延迟/丢包条件**了。

这两个机制，一个是告诉你**延迟丢包条件**是否合适的，一个是告诉你**下载速度条件**是否合适的。

&lt;/details&gt;

****

### 使用示例

Windows 要指定参数需要在 CMD 中运行，或者把参数添加到快捷方式目标中。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; - 各参数均有**默认值**，当使用默认值时参数可以省略（**按需选择**），参数**不分前后顺序**。  
&gt; - Windows **PowerShell** 只需把下面命令中的 `cfst.exe` 改为 `.\cfst.exe` 即可。  
&gt; - Linux / macOS 系统只需要把下面命令中的 `cfst.exe` 改为 `./cfst` 即可。

****

#### \# CMD 带参数运行

对命令行程序不熟悉的人，可能不知道该如何带参数运行，我就简单说一下。

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击展开 查看内容 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

很多人打开 CMD 直接就以**绝对路径**运行 CFST 会报错，这是因为默认的 `-f ip.txt` 参数是相对路径，需要指定绝对路径的 ip.txt 才行，但这样毕竟太麻烦了，因此还是建议进入 CFST 程序目录下，以**相对路径**方式运行：

**方式 一**：
1. 打开 CFST 程序所在目录  
2. 空白处按下 &lt;kbd&gt;Shift + 鼠标右键&lt;/kbd&gt; 显示右键菜单  
3. 选择 **\[在此处打开命令窗口\]** 来打开 CMD 窗口，此时默认就位于当前目录下  
4. 输入带参数的命令，如：`cfst.exe -tl 200 -dn 20` 即可运行

**方式 二**：
1. 打开 CFST 程序所在目录  
2. 直接在文件夹地址栏中全选(或清空)并输入 `cmd` 回车就能打开 CMD 窗口，此时默认就位于当前目录下  
4. 输入带参数的命令，如：`cfst.exe -tl 200 -dn 20` 即可运行

&gt; 当然你也可以随便打开一个 CMD 窗口，然后输入如 `cd /d &quot;D:\Program Files\cfst&quot;` 来进入程序目录

&gt; **提示**：如果用的是 **PowerShell** 只需把命令中的 `cfst.exe` 改为 `.\cfst.exe` 即可。  
&gt; **注意**：在 **PowerShell** 下使用 `-o &quot;&quot;` 会被忽略掉空参数导致报错，可加个空格 `-o &quot; &quot;` 解决

&lt;/details&gt;

#### \# Windows 快捷方式带参数运行

如果不经常修改运行参数（比如平时都是直接双击运行）的人，建议使用快捷方式，更方便点。

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击展开 查看内容 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

右键 `cfst.exe` 文件 - **\[创建快捷方式\]**，然后右键该快捷方式 - **\[属性\]**，修改其**目标**：

``` bash
# 如果要不输出结果文件，那么请加上 -o &quot; &quot;，引号里的是空格（不加空格会导致该空参数被忽略从而报错）。
D:\ABC\cfst\cfst.exe -tl 200 -dn 20 -o &quot; &quot;

# 如果文件路径包含引号，则需要把启动参数放在引号外面，记得引号和 - 之间有空格。
&quot;D:\Program Files\cfst\cfst.exe&quot; -tl 200 -dn 20 -o &quot; &quot;

# 注意！快捷方式 - 起始位置 不能是空的，否则就会因为绝对路径而找不到 ip.txt 文件
```

&lt;/details&gt;

****

#### \# IPv4/IPv6

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击展开 查看内容 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****
``` bash
# 指定自带的 IPv4 数据文件可测速这些 IPv4 地址（-f 默认值就是 ip.txt，所以该参数可省略）
cfst.exe -f ip.txt

# 指定自带的 IPv6 数据文件可测速这些 IPv6 地址
# 另外，v2.1.0 版本后支持 IPv4+IPv6 混合测速并移除了 -ipv6 参数，因此一个文件内可以同时包含 IPv4+IPv6 地址
cfst.exe -f ipv6.txt

# 也可以直接通过参数指定要测速的 IP
cfst.exe -ip 1.1.1.1,2606:4700::/32
```

&gt; 测速 IPv6 时，可能会注意到每次测速数量都不一样，了解原因： [#120](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/issues/120)  
&gt; 因为 IPv6 太多（以亿为单位），且绝大部分 IP 段压根未启用，所以我只扫了一部分可用的 IPv6 段写到 `ipv6.txt` 文件中，有兴趣的可以自行扫描增删，ASN 数据源来自：[bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net/AS13335#_prefixes6)

&lt;/details&gt;

#### \# HTTPing

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击展开 查看内容 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

目前有两种延迟测速模式，分别为 **TCP 协议、HTTP 协议**。  
TCP 协议耗时更短、消耗资源更少，超时时间为 1 秒，该协议为默认模式。  
HTTP 协议适用于快速测试某域名指向某 IP 时是否可以访问，超时时间为 2 秒。  
同一个 IP，各协议去 Ping 得到的延迟一般为：**ICMP &lt; TCP &lt; HTTP**，越靠右对丢包等网络波动越敏感。

&gt; 注意：HTTPing 本质上也算一种**网络扫描**行为，因此如果你在服务器上面运行，需要**降低并发**(`-n`)，否则可能会被一些严格的商家暂停服务。如果你遇到 HTTPing 首次测速可用 IP 数量正常，后续测速越来越少甚至直接为 0，但停一段时间后又恢复了的情况，那么也可能是被 运营商、Cloudflare CDN 认为你在网络扫描而**触发临时限制机制**，因此才会过一会儿就恢复了，建议**降低并发**(`-n`)减少这种情况的发生。

&gt; 另外，本软件 HTTPing 仅获取**响应头(response headers)**，并不获取正文内容（即 URL 文件大小不影响 HTTPing 测试，但如果你还要下载测速的话，那么还是需要一个大文件的），类似于 curl -i 功能。

&gt; 另外，HTTPing 过程中，软件会从 HTTP 响应头中获取该 IP 当前地区码（支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN）并显示出来，而 TCPing 过程中无法这样做（但 下载测速 时也会这样做来获取地区码，毕竟下载测速也是个 HTTP 链接）

``` bash
# 只需加上 -httping 参数即可切换到 HTTP 协议延迟测速模式
cfst.exe -httping

# 软件会根据访问时网页返回的有效 HTTP 状态码来判断可用性（当然超时也算），默认对返回 200 301 302 这三个 HTTP 状态码的视为有效，可以手动指定认为有效的 HTTP 状态码，但只能指定一个（你需要提前确定测试地址正常情况下会返回哪个状态码）
cfst.exe -httping -httping-code 200

# 通过 -url 参数来指定 HTTPing 测试地址（可以是任意网页 URL，不局限于具体文件地址）
cfst.exe -httping -url https://cf.xiu2.xyz/url
# 如果你要 HTTPing 测试其他网站/CDN，那么指定一个该网站/使用该 CDN 的地址（因为软件默认地址是 Cloudflare 的，只能用于测试 Cloudflare 的 IP）

# 注意：如果测速地址为 HTTP 协议，记得加上 -tp 80（这个参数会影响 延迟测速/下载测速 时使用的端口）
# 同理，如果要测速 80 端口，那么也需要加上 -url 参数来指定一个 http:// 协议的地址才行（且该地址不会强制重定向至 HTTPS），如果是非 80 443 端口，那么需要确定该下载测速地址是否支持通过该端口访问。
cfst.exe -httping -tp 80 -url http://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5952/movie_max.webm
```

&lt;/details&gt;

#### \# 匹配指定地区

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击展开 查看内容 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

Cloudflare CDN 的节点 IP 是 Anycast IP，即每个 IP 对应的服务器节点及地区不是固定的，而是动态变化的，**不同地区、不同运营商、不同时间段**访问**同一个 IP** 分配到的服务器节点地区和路线也都是不一样的（比如同一个 IP，美国人访问就是分配到就近的美国节点服务器，日本人访问则就又变成了就近的日本节点服务器了，国内内地就比较特殊了，只能给你分配到其他国家，当然不同的 IP 段路由变化/分配逻辑也是不同的，有的 IP 段会较为固定）。

&gt; **注意**！虽然 Cloudflare CDN 有很多亚洲节点，但**不代表你就能用上**，新加坡人测速可能随便一抓一大把的新加坡节点，但你全部扫一遍可能都遇不到一个，因为这是由 CDN 控制的。Anycast IP 的路由是经常变的，同一个 IP 今天可能是美国，明天你再访问可能就又分配到欧洲节点了（当然这只是个例子，一般没有那么频繁，这也和很多因素有关，比如线路拥塞程度，成本变动等），因此**不要对该功能有过高期待**~

或者你随便找个 Cloudflare CDN 的 IP（比如官网域名的解析 IP `104.16.123.96`），然后去那些有全球节点的[在线 Ping 测试](https://ping.sx/ping?t=104.16.123.96)网站，你就会发现这个 IP 在全球大部分地区的延迟都是个位数（而且很多都是 0.X ms），就算一些地方延迟高一些但也基本都控制在 几十ms，只有在国内才会发现突然变成了 上百ms 了。

这就是 Anycast 技术，也就只有国内大陆这种特殊的网络情况，才需要对 Anycast 的 CDN IP 进行优选。

因此，对于这种 Anycast IP 的实际服务器位置，就不能靠那些在线 IP 地址位置查询网站来判断了。

除了通过 **HTTP 响应头**获取地区码外（该功能的实现方式），还可以手动访问 `http://CloudflareIP/cdn-cgi/trace` 来获知 CDN 分配给你的实际节点地区码。

&gt; 该功能支持 **Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny** 等 CDN。  
&gt; 但注意，不是所有 CDN 都支持 Anycast 技术的，很多 CDN 会限制一个网站能使用的 IP 范围。

&gt; 其中 **Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly** 都使用的是 **`IATA 三字机场地区码`**，如：HKG,LAX  
&gt; 而 **CDN77、Bunny** 使用的是 **`二字国家/区域码`**，如：US,CN  
&gt; **Gcore** 则使用的是 **`二字城市码`**，如：FR,AM  
&gt; 因此大家使用 `-cfcolo` 指定地区码时要根据不同的 CDN 来指定不同类型的地区码。

&gt; **注意**：如果你要用于筛选 AWS CloudFront CDN 地区，那么要通过 `-url` 参数指定一个使用 AWS CloudFront CDN 的下载测速地址（因为软件默认下载测速地址是 Cloudflare CDN 的），另外有时候 HTTPing 模式测速一些 AWS CloudFront 地址会返回 403 错误，这种情况下需要加上 `-httping-code 403` 才能正确获取地区码。

``` bash
# 指定地区名后，延迟测速后得到的结果就都是指定地区的 IP 了（如果没有指定 -dd 的话则会继续进行下载测速）
# 如果延迟测速后结果为 0，则说明没有找到任何一个（未超时可用的）指定地区的 IP。
# 节点地区名为当地 IATA 机场地区码或国家/城市码，指定多个时用英文逗号分隔，v2.2.3 版本后支持小写

cfst.exe -httping -cfcolo HKG,KHH,NRT,LAX,SEA,SJC,FRA,MAD

# 注意，该参数只有在 HTTPing 延迟测速模式下才可用（因为软件是通过 HTTP 链接中的响应头来获得该 IP 的实际地区码）

# 另外，HTTPing 过程中，软件会从 HTTP 响应头中获取该 IP 当前地区码（支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN）并显示出来，而 TCPing 过程中无法这样做（但 下载测速 时也会这样做来获取地区码，毕竟下载测速也是个 HTTP 链接）
```

## ✨ Features &lt;a id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A powerful and flexible Kubernetes [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://blog.marcnuri.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-introduction) server implementation with support for **Kubernetes** and **OpenShift**.

- **✅ Configuration**:
  - Automatically detect changes in the Kubernetes configuration and update the MCP server.
  - **View** and manage the current [Kubernetes `.kube/config`](https://blog.marcnuri.com/where-is-my-default-kubeconfig-file) or in-cluster configuration.
- **✅ Generic Kubernetes Resources**: Perform operations on **any** Kubernetes or OpenShift resource.
  - Any CRUD operation (Create or Update, Get, List, Delete).
- **✅ Pods**: Perform Pod-specific operations.
  - **List** pods in all namespaces or in a specific namespace.
  - **Get** a pod by name from the specified namespace.
  - **Delete** a pod by name from the specified namespace.
  - **Show logs** for a pod by name from the specified namespace.
  - **Top** gets resource usage metrics for all pods or a specific pod in the specified namespace.
  - **Exec** into a pod and run a command.
  - **Run** a container image in a pod and optionally expose it.
- **✅ Namespaces**: List Kubernetes Namespaces.
- **✅ Events**: View Kubernetes events in all namespaces or in a specific namespace.
- **✅ Projects**: List OpenShift Projects.
- **☸️ Helm**:
  - **Install** a Helm chart in the current or provided namespace.
  - **List** Helm releases in all namespaces or in a specific namespace.
  - **Uninstall** a Helm release in the current or provided namespace.

Unlike other Kubernetes MCP server implementations, this **IS NOT** just a wrapper around `kubectl` or `helm` command-line tools.
It is a **Go-based native implementation** that interacts directly with the Kubernetes API server.

There is **NO NEED** for external dependencies or tools to be installed on the system.
If you&#039;re using the native binaries you don&#039;t need to have Node or Python installed on your system.

- **✅ Lightweight**: The server is distributed as a single native binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **✅ High-Performance / Low-Latency**: Directly interacts with the Kubernetes API server without the overhead of calling and waiting for external commands.

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Claude Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Follow the [dedicated Claude Code getting started guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED_CLAUDE_CODE.md) in our [user documentation](docs/).

For a secure production setup with dedicated ServiceAccount and read-only access, also review the [Kubernetes setup guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED_KUBERNETES.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

### Claude Desktop

#### Using npx

If you have npm installed, this is the fastest way to get started with `kubernetes-mcp-server` on Claude Desktop.

Open your `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the mcp server to the list of `mcpServers`:
``` json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;kubernetes&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;kubernetes-mcp-server@latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code / VS Code Insiders

Install the Kubernetes MCP server extension in VS Code Insiders by pressing the following link:

Alternatively, you can install the extension manually by running the following command:

```shell
# For VS Code
code --add-mcp &#039;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;kubernetes&quot;,&quot;command&quot;:&quot;npx&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:[&quot;kubernetes-mcp-server@latest&quot;]}&#039;
# For VS Code Insiders
code-insiders --add-mcp &#039;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;kubernetes&quot;,&quot;command&quot;:&quot;npx&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:[&quot;kubernetes-mcp-server@latest&quot;]}&#039;
```

### Cursor

Install the Kubernetes MCP server extension in Cursor by pressing the following link:

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=kubernetes-mcp-server&amp;config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IGt1YmVybmV0ZXMtbWNwLXNlcnZlckBsYXRlc3QifQ%3D%3D)

Alternatively, you can install the extension manually by editing the `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;kubernetes-mcp-server&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;kubernetes-mcp-server@latest&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Goose CLI

[Goose CLI](https://blog.marcnuri.com/goose-on-machine-ai-agent-cli-introduction) is the easiest (and cheapest) way to get rolling with artificial intelligence (AI) agents.

#### Using npm

If you have npm installed, this is the fastest way to get started with `kubernetes-mcp-server`.

Open your goose `config.yaml` and add the mcp server to the list of `mcpServers`:
```yaml
extensions:
  kubernetes:
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - kubernetes-mcp-server@latest

```

### Configuration Options

| Option                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--port`                  | Starts the MCP server in Streamable HTTP mode (path /mcp) and Server-Sent Event (SSE) (path /sse) mode and listens on the specified port .                                                                                                                                                    |
| `--log-level`             | Sets the logging level (values [from 0-9](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-instrumentation/logging.md)). Similar to [kubectl logging levels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/#kubectl-output-verbosity-and-debugging). |
| `--config`                | (Optional) Path to the main TOML configuration file. See [Drop-in Configuration](#drop-in-configuration) section below for details.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `--config-dir`            | (Optional) Path to drop-in configuration directory. Files are loaded in lexical (alphabetical) order. Defaults to `conf.d` relative to the main config file if `--config` is specified. See [Drop-in Configuration](#drop-in-configuration) section below for details.                       |
| `--kubeconfig`            | Path to the Kubernetes configuration file. If not provided, it will try to resolve the configuration (in-cluster, default location, etc.).                                                                                                                                                    |
| `--list-output`           | Output format for resource list operations (one of: yaml, table) (default &quot;table&quot;)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `--read-only`             | If set, the MCP server will run in read-only mode, meaning it will not allow any write operations (create, update, delete) on the Kubernetes cluster. This is useful for debugging or inspecting the cluster without making changes.                                                          |
| `--disable-destructive`   | If set, the MCP server will disable all destructive operations (delete, update, etc.) on the Kubernetes cluster. This is useful for debugging or inspecting the cluster without accidentally making changes. This option has no effect when `--read-only` is used.                            |
| `--toolsets`              | Comma-separated list of toolsets to enable. Check the [🛠️ Tools and Functionalities](#tools-and-functionalities) section for more information.                                                                                                                                               |
| `--disable-multi-cluster` | If set, the MCP server will disable multi-cluster support and will only use the current context from the kubeconfig file. This is useful if you want to restrict the MCP server to a single cluster.                                                                                          |

### Drop-in Configuration &lt;a id=&quot;drop-in-configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Kubernetes MCP server supports flexible configuration through both a main config file and drop-in files. **Both are optional** - you can use either, both, or neither (server will use built-in defaults).

#### Configuration Loading Order

Configuration values are loaded and merged in the following order (later sources override earlier ones):

1. **Internal Defaults** - Always loaded (hardcoded default values)
2. **Main Configuration File** - Optional, loaded via `--config` flag
3. **Drop-in Files** - Optional, loaded from `--config-dir` in **lexical (alphabetical) order**

#### How Drop-in Files Work

- **Default Directory**: If `--config-dir` is not specified, the server looks for drop-in files in `conf.d/` relative to the main config file&#039;s directory (when `--config` is provided)
- **File Naming**: Use numeric prefixes to control loading order (e.g., `00-base.toml`, `10-cluster.toml`, `99-override.toml`)
- **File Extension**: Only `.toml` files are processed; dotfiles (starting with `.`) are ignored
- **Partial Configuration**: Drop-in files can contain only a subset of configuration options
- **Merge Behavior**: Values present in a drop-in file override previous values; missing values are preserved

#### Dynamic Configuration Reload

To reload configuration after modifying config files, send a `SIGHUP` signal to the running server process.

**Prerequisite**: SIGHUP reload requires the server to be started with either the `--config` flag or `--config-dir` flag (or both). If neither is specified, SIGHUP signals will be ignored.

**How to reload:**

```shell
# Find the process ID
ps aux | grep kubernetes-mcp-server

# Send SIGHUP to reload configuration
kill -HUP &lt;pid&gt;

# Or use pkill
pkill -HUP kubernetes-mcp-server
```

The server will:
- Reload the main config file and all drop-in files
- Update configuration values (log level, output format, etc.)
- Rebuild the toolset registry with new tool configurations
- Log the reload status

**Note**: Changing `kubeconfig` or cluster-related settings requires a server restart. Only tool configurations, log levels, and output formats can be reloaded dynamically.

**Note**: SIGHUP reload is not available on Windows. On Windows, restart the server to reload configuration.

#### Example: Using Both Config Methods

**Command (using default `conf.d` directory):**
```shell
kubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml
```

**Directory structure:**
```
/etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/
├── config.toml              # Main configuration
└── conf.d/                  # Default drop-in directory (automatically loaded)
    ├── 00-base.toml         # Base overrides
    ├── 10-toolsets.toml     # Toolset-specific config
    └── 99-local.toml        # Local overrides
```

**Command (with explicit `--config-dir`):**
```shell
kubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml \
                      --config-dir /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.d/
```

**Example drop-in file** (`10-toolsets.toml`):
```toml
# Override only the toolsets - all other config preserved
toolsets = [&quot;core&quot;, &quot;config&quot;, &quot;helm&quot;, &quot;logs&quot;]
```

**Example drop-in file** (`99-local.toml`):
```toml
# Local development overrides
log_level = 9
read_only = true
```

**To apply changes:**
```shell
# Edit config files
vim /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/conf.d/99-local.toml

# Reload without restarting
pkill -HUP kubernetes-mcp-server
```

## 🛠️ Tools and Functionalities &lt;a id=&quot;tools-and-functionalities&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Kubernetes MCP server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of tools and functionalities (tools, resources, prompts, and so on) via the `--toolsets` command-line flag or `toolsets` configuration option.
This allows you to control which Kubernetes functionalities are available to your AI tools.
Enabling only the toolsets you need can help reduce the context size and improve the LLM&#039;s tool selection accuracy.

### Available Toolsets

The following sets of tools are available (toolsets marked with ✓ in the Default column are enabled by default):

&lt;!-- AVAILABLE-TOOLSETS-START --&gt;

#### GitHub&#039;s online schema migration for MySQL &lt;img src=&quot;doc/images/gh-ost-logo-light-160.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

 `gh-ost` is a triggerless online schema migration solution for MySQL. It is testable and provides pausability, dynamic control/reconfiguration, auditing, and many operational perks.

`gh-ost` produces a light workload on the master throughout the migration, decoupled from the existing workload on the migrated table.

It has been designed based on years of experience with existing solutions, and changes the paradigm of table migrations.



## How?

All existing online-schema-change tools operate in similar manner: they create a _ghost_ table in the likeness of your original table, migrate that table while empty, slowly and incrementally copy data from your original table to the _ghost_ table, meanwhile propagating ongoing changes (any `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE` applied to your table) to the _ghost_ table. Finally, at the right time, they replace your original table with the _ghost_ table.

`gh-ost` uses the same pattern. However it differs from all existing tools by not using triggers. We have recognized the triggers to be the source of [many limitations and risks](doc/why-triggerless.md).

Instead, `gh-ost` [uses the binary log stream](doc/triggerless-design.md) to capture table changes, and asynchronously applies them onto the _ghost_ table. `gh-ost` takes upon itself some tasks that other tools leave for the database to perform. As result, `gh-ost` has greater control over the migration process; can truly suspend it; can truly decouple the migration&#039;s write load from the master&#039;s workload.

In addition, it offers many [operational perks](doc/perks.md) that make it safer, trustworthy and fun to use.

![gh-ost general flow](doc/images/gh-ost-general-flow.png)

## Highlights

- Build your trust in `gh-ost` by testing it on replicas. `gh-ost` will issue same flow as it would have on the master, to migrate a table on a replica, without actually replacing the original table, leaving the replica with two tables you can then compare and satisfy yourself that the tool operates correctly. This is how we continuously test `gh-ost` in production.
- True pause: when `gh-ost` [throttles](doc/throttle.md), it truly ceases writes on master: no row copies and no ongoing events processing. By throttling, you return your master to its original workload
- Dynamic control: you can [interactively](doc/interactive-commands.md) reconfigure `gh-ost`, even as migration still runs. You may forcibly initiate throttling.
- Auditing: you may query `gh-ost` for status. `gh-ost` listens on unix socket or TCP.
- Control over cut-over phase: `gh-ost` can be instructed to postpone what is probably the most critical step: the swap of tables, until such time that you&#039;re comfortably available. No need to worry about ETA being outside office hours.
- External [hooks](doc/hooks.md) can couple `gh-ost` with your particular environment.

Please refer to the [docs](doc) for more information. No, really, read the [docs](doc).

## Usage

The [cheatsheet](doc/cheatsheet.md) has it all. You may be interested in invoking `gh-ost` in various modes:

- a _noop_ migration (merely testing that the migration is valid and good to go)
- a real migration, utilizing a replica (the migration runs on the master; `gh-ost` figures out identities of servers involved. Required mode if your master uses Statement Based Replication)
- a real migration, run directly on the master (but `gh-ost` prefers the former)
- a real migration on a replica (master untouched)
- a test migration on a replica, the way for you to build trust with `gh-ost`&#039;s operation.

Our tips:

- [Testing above all](doc/testing-on-replica.md), try out `--test-on-replica` first few times. Better yet, make it continuous. We have multiple replicas where we iterate our entire fleet of production tables, migrating them one by one, checksumming the results, verifying migration is good.
- For each master migration, first issue a _noop_
- Then issue the real thing via `--execute`.

More tips:

- Use `--exact-rowcount` for accurate progress indication
- Use `--postpone-cut-over-flag-file` to gain control over cut-over timing
- Get familiar with the [interactive commands](doc/interactive-commands.md)

## What&#039;s in a name?

Originally this was named `gh-osc`: GitHub Online Schema Change, in the likes of [Facebook online schema change](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mysql-at-facebook/online-schema-change-for-mysql/430801045932/) and [pt-online-schema-change](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.2/pt-online-schema-change.html).

But then a rare genetic mutation happened, and the `c` transformed into `t`. And that sent us down the path of trying to figure out a new acronym. `gh-ost` (pronounce: _Ghost_), stands for GitHub&#039;s Online Schema Transmogrifier/Translator/Transformer/Transfigurator

## License

`gh-ost` is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/github/gh-ost/blob/master/LICENSE)

`gh-ost` uses 3rd party libraries, each with their own license. These are found [here](https://github.com/github/gh-ost/tree/master/vendor).

## Community

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](https://docs.ollama.com/import) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Generate embeddings from the CLI

```shell
ollama run embeddinggemma &quot;Your text to embed&quot;
```

You can also pipe text for scripted workflows:

```shell
echo &quot;Your text to embed&quot; | ollama run embeddinggemma
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

&gt; 📢 [ThanosCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/thanoscon/) happened on 19th March 2024 as a co-located half-day on KubeCon EU in Paris.

## Overview

Thanos is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available metric system with unlimited storage capacity, which can be added seamlessly on top of existing Prometheus deployments.

Thanos is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Incubating project.

Thanos leverages the Prometheus 2.0 storage format to cost-efficiently store historical metric data in any object storage while retaining fast query latencies. Additionally, it provides a global query view across all Prometheus installations and can merge data from Prometheus HA pairs on the fly.

Concretely the aims of the project are:

1. Global query view of metrics.
2. Unlimited retention of metrics.
3. High availability of components, including Prometheus.

## Getting Started

* **[Getting Started](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/getting-started.md/)**
* [Design](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/design.md/)
* [Blog posts](docs/getting-started.md#blog-posts)
* [Talks](docs/getting-started.md#talks)
* [Proposals](docs/proposals-done)
* [Integrations](docs/integrations.md)

## Features

* Global querying view across all connected Prometheus servers
* Deduplication and merging of metrics collected from Prometheus HA pairs
* Seamless integration with existing Prometheus setups
* Any object storage as its only, optional dependency
* Downsampling historical data for massive query speedup
* Cross-cluster federation
* Fault-tolerant query routing
* Simple gRPC &quot;Store API&quot; for unified data access across all metric data
* Easy integration points for custom metric providers

## Thanos Philosophy

The philosophy of Thanos and our community is borrowing much from UNIX philosophy and the golang programming language.

* Each subcommand should do one thing and do it well
  * e.g. thanos query proxies incoming calls to known store API endpoints merging the result
* Write components that work together
  * e.g. blocks should be stored in native prometheus format
* Make it easy to read, write, and, run components
  * e.g. reduce complexity in system design and implementation

## Releases

Main branch should be stable and usable. Every commit to main builds docker image named `main-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;sha&gt;` in [quay.io/thanos/thanos](https://quay.io/repository/thanos/thanos) and [thanosio/thanos dockerhub (mirror)](https://hub.docker.com/r/thanosio/thanos)

We also perform minor releases every 6 weeks.

During that, we build tarballs for major platforms and release docker images.

See [release process docs](docs/release-process.md) for details.

## Installation

### Recommended

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/grype | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```
Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of grype is community-maintained and not distributed by the anchore team.

```bash
choco install grype -y
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap anchore/grype
brew install grype
```

### MacPorts

On macOS, Grype can additionally be installed from the [community-maintained port](https://ports.macports.org/port/grype/) via MacPorts:

```bash
sudo port install grype
```

**Note**: Currently, Grype is built only for macOS and Linux.

### From source

See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md#native-development) for instructions to build and run from source.

### GitHub Actions

If you&#039;re using GitHub Actions, you can use our [Grype-based action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/anchore-container-scan) to run vulnerability scans on your code or container images during your CI workflows.

## Verifying the artifacts

Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.

You need the following tool to verify signature:

- [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)

Verification steps are as follow:

1. Download the files you want, and the checksums.txt, checksums.txt.pem and checksums.txt.sig files from the [releases](https://github.com/anchore/grype/releases) page:

2. Verify the signature:

```shell
cosign verify-blob &lt;path to checksum.txt&gt; \
--certificate &lt;path to checksums.txt.pem&gt; \
--signature &lt;path to checksums.txt.sig&gt; \
--certificate-identity-regexp &#039;https://github\.com/anchore/grype/\.github/workflows/.+&#039; \
--certificate-oidc-issuer &quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot;
```

3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:

```shell
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt
```

## Getting started

[Install the binary](#installation), and make sure that `grype` is available in your path. To scan for vulnerabilities in an image:

```
grype &lt;image&gt;
```

The above command scans for vulnerabilities visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the vulnerability scan, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```
grype &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

To run grype from a Docker container so it can scan a running container, use the following command:

```yml
docker run --rm \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
--name Grype anchore/grype:latest \
$(ImageName):$(ImageTag)
```

## Supported sources

Grype can scan a variety of sources beyond those found in Docker.

```
# scan a container image archive (from the result of `docker image save ...`, `podman save ...`, or `skopeo copy` commands)
grype path/to/image.tar

# scan a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container
grype path/to/image.sif

# scan a directory
grype dir:path/to/dir
```

Sources can be explicitly provided with a scheme:

```
podman:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Podman daemon
docker:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Docker daemon
docker-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar   use a tarball from disk for archives created from &quot;docker save&quot;
oci-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar      use a tarball from disk for OCI archives (from Skopeo or otherwise)
oci-dir:path/to/yourimage              read directly from a path on disk for OCI layout directories (from Skopeo or otherwise)
singularity:path/to/yourimage.sif      read directly from a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container on disk
dir:path/to/yourproject                read directly from a path on disk (any directory)
file:path/to/yourfile                  read directly from a file on disk
sbom:path/to/syft.json                 read Syft JSON from path on disk
registry:yourrepo/yourimage:tag        pull image directly from a registry (no container runtime required)
```

If an image source is not provided and cannot be detected from the given reference it is assumed the image should be pulled from the Docker daemon.
If docker is not present, then the Podman daemon is attempted next, followed by reaching out directly to the image registry last.


This default behavior can be overridden with the `default-image-pull-source` configuration option (See [Configuration](https://github.com/anchore/grype#configuration) for more details).

Use SBOMs for even faster vulnerability scanning in Grype:

```
# Then scan for new vulnerabilities as frequently as needed
grype sbom:./sbom.json

# (You can also pipe the SBOM into Grype)
cat ./sbom.json | grype
```

Grype supports input of [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)
SBOM formats. If Syft has generated any of these file types, they should have the appropriate information to work properly with Grype.
It is also possible to use SBOMs generated by other tools with varying degrees of success. Two things that make Grype matching
more successful are the inclusion of CPE and Linux distribution information. If an SBOM does not include any CPE information, it
is possible to generate these based on package information using the `--add-cpes-if-none` flag. To specify a distribution,
use the `--distro &lt;distro&gt;:&lt;version&gt;` flag. A full example is:

```
grype --add-cpes-if-none --distro alpine:3.10 sbom:some-alpine-3.10.spdx.json
```

## Threat &amp; Risk Prioritization

This section explains the columns and UI cues that help prioritize remediation efforts:

- **Severity**: String-based severity derived from CVSS scores that indicates the significance of a vulnerability in levels.
  This balances concerns such as ease of exploitability, and the potential to affect
  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of software and services.

- **EPSS**:
  [Exploit Prediction Scoring System](https://www.first.org/epss/model) is a metric expressing the likelihood
  that a vulnerability will be 
  exploited in the wild over the next 30 days (on a 0–1 scale); higher values signal a greater likelihood of 
  exploitation.
  The table output shows the EPSS percentile, a one-way transform of the EPSS score showing the 
  proportion of all scored vulnerabilities with an equal or lower probability.
  Percentiles linearize a heavily skewed distribution, making threshold choice (e.g. “only CVEs above the 
  90th percentile”) straightforward.

- **KEV Indicator**: Flags entries from CISA’s [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
  --an authoritative list of flaws observed being exploited in the wild.

- **Risk Score**: A composite 0–100 metric calculated as:
  ```markdown
  risk = min(1, threat * average(severity)) * 100
  ```
  Where: 
  - `severity` is the average of all CVSS scores and string severity for a vulnerability (scaled between 0–1).
  - `threat` is the EPSS score (between 0–1). If the vulnerability is on the KEV list then `threat` is 
    `1.05`, or `1.1` if the vulnerability is associated with a ransomware campaign.
  This metric is one way to combine EPSS and CVSS suggested in the [EPSS user guide](https://www.first.org/epss/user-guide).

- **Suggested Fixes**: All possible fixes for a package are listed, however, when multiple fixes are available, we de-emphasize all 
  upgrade paths except for the minimal upgrade path (which highlights the smallest, safest version bump).

Results default to sorting by Risk Score and can be overridden with `--sort-by &lt;value&gt;`:

- `severity`: sort by severity
- `epss`: sort by EPSS percentile (aka, &quot;threat&quot;)
- `risk`: sort by risk score
- `kev`: just like risk, except that KEV entries are always above non-KEV entries
- `package`: sort by package name, version, type
- `vulnerability`: sort by vulnerability ID

### Supported versions

Software updates are always applied to the latest version of Grype; fixes are not backported to any previous versions of Grype.

In terms of database updates, any version of Grype before v0.51.0 (Oct 2022, before schema v5) will not receive
vulnerability database updates. You can still build vulnerability databases for unsupported Grype releases by using previous
releases of [vunnel](https://github.com/anchore/vunnel) to gather the upstream data and [grype-db](https://github.com/anchore/grype-db)
to build databases for unsupported schemas.

Only the latest database schema is considered to be supported. When a new database schema is introduced then the one it replaces is
marked as deprecated. Deprecated schemas will continue to receive updates for at least one year after they are marked
as deprecated at which point they will no longer be supported.

### Working with attestations
Grype supports scanning SBOMs as input via stdin. Users can use [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to verify attestations
with an SBOM as its content to scan an image for vulnerabilities:
```
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-attestation caphill4/java-spdx-tools:latest \
| jq -r .payload \
| base64 --decode \
| jq -r .predicate.Data \
| grype
```

### Vulnerability Summary

#### Basic Grype Vulnerability Data Shape

```json
 {
  &quot;vulnerability&quot;: {
    ...
  },
  &quot;relatedVulnerabilities&quot;: [
    ...
  ],
  &quot;matchDetails&quot;: [
    ...
  ],
  &quot;artifact&quot;: {
    ...
  }
}
```

- **Vulnerability**: All information on the specific vulnerability that was directly matched on (e.g. ID, severity, CVSS score, fix information, links for more information)
- **RelatedVulnerabilities**: Information pertaining to vulnerabilities found to be related to the main reported vulnerability. Perhaps the vulnerability we matched on was a GitHub Security Advisory, which has an upstream CVE (in the authoritative national vulnerability database). In these cases we list the upstream vulnerabilities here.
- **MatchDetails**: This section tries to explain what we searched for while looking for a match and exactly what details on the package and vulnerability that led to a match.
- **Artifact**: This is a subset of the information that we know about the package (when compared to the [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) json output, we summarize the metadata section).
  This has information about where within the container image or directory we found the package, what kind of package it is, licensing info, pURLs, CPEs, etc.

### Excluding file paths

Grype can exclude files and paths from being scanned within a source by using glob expressions
with one or more `--exclude` parameters:

```
grype &lt;source&gt; --exclude &#039;./out/**/*.json&#039; --exclude /etc
```

**Note:** in the case of _image scanning_, since the entire filesystem is scanned it is
possible to use absolute paths like `/etc` or `/usr/**/*.txt` whereas _directory scans_
exclude files _relative to the specified directory_. For example: scanning `/usr/foo` with
`--exclude ./package.json` would exclude `/usr/foo/package.json` and `--exclude &#039;**/package.json&#039;`
would exclude all `package.json` files under `/usr/foo`. For _directory scans_,
it is required to begin path expressions with `./`, `*/`, or `**/`, all of which
will be resolved _relative to the specified scan directory_. Keep in mind, your shell
may attempt to expand wildcards, so put those parameters in single quotes, like:
`&#039;**/*.json&#039;`.

### External Sources

Grype can be configured to incorporate external data sources for added fidelity in vulnerability matching. This
feature is currently disabled by default. To enable this feature add the following to the grype config:

```yaml
external-sources:
  enable: true
  maven:
    search-upstream-by-sha1: true
    base-url: https://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select
    rate-limit: 300ms # Time between Maven API requests
```

You can also configure the base-url if you&#039;re using another registry as your maven endpoint.

The rate at which Maven API requests are made can be configured to match your environment&#039;s requirements. The default is 300ms between requests.

### Output formats

The output format for Grype is configurable as well:

```
grype &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the formats available are:

- `table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `cyclonedx`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `json`: Use this to get as much information out of Grype as possible!
- `sarif`: Use this option to get a [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) report (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](#using-templates) below.

### Using templates

Grype lets you define custom output formats, using [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). Here&#039;s how it works:

- Define your format as a Go template, and save this template as a file.

- Set the output format to &quot;template&quot; (`-o template`).

- Specify the path to the template file (`-t ./path/to/custom.template`).

- Grype&#039;s template processing uses the same data models as the `json` output format — so if you&#039;re wondering what data is available as you author a template, you can use the output from `grype &lt;image&gt; -o json` as a reference.

**Please note:** Templates can access information about the system they are running on, such as environment variables. You should never run untrusted templates.

There are several example templates in the [templates](https://github.com/anchore/grype/tree/main/templates) directory in the Grype source which can serve as a starting point for a custom output format. For example, [csv.tmpl](https://github.com/anchore/grype/blob/main/templates/csv.tmpl) produces a vulnerability report in CSV (comma separated value) format:

```text
&quot;Package&quot;,&quot;Version Installed&quot;,&quot;Vulnerability ID&quot;,&quot;Severity&quot;
&quot;coreutils&quot;,&quot;8.30-3ubuntu2&quot;,&quot;CVE-2016-2781&quot;,&quot;Low&quot;
&quot;libc-bin&quot;,&quot;2.31-0ubuntu9&quot;,&quot;CVE-2016-10228&quot;,&quot;Negligible&quot;
&quot;libc-bin&quot;,&quot;2.31-0ubuntu9&quot;,&quot;CVE-2020-6096&quot;,&quot;Low&quot;
...
```

You can also find the template for the default &quot;table&quot; output format in the same place.

Grype also includes a vast array of utility templating functions from [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) apart from the default golang [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Functions) to allow users to customize the output from Grype.

### Gating on severity of vulnerabilities

You can have Grype exit with an error if any vulnerabilities are reported at or above the specified severity level. This comes in handy when using Grype within a script or CI pipeline. To do this, use the `--fail-on &lt;severity&gt;` CLI flag.

For example, here&#039;s how you could trigger a CI pipeline failure if any vulnerabilities are found in the `ubuntu:latest` image with a severity of &quot;medium&quot; or higher:

```
grype ubuntu:latest --fail-on medium
```

**Note:** Grype returns exit code `2` on vulnerability errors.

### Specifying matches to ignore

If you&#039;re seeing Grype report **false positives** or any other vulnerability matches that you just don&#039;t want to see, you can tell Grype to **ignore** matches by specifying one or more _&quot;ignore rules&quot;_ in your Grype configuration file (e.g. `~/.grype.yaml`). This causes Grype not to report any vulnerability matches that meet the criteria specified by any of your ignore rules.

Each rule can specify any combination of the following criteria:

- vulnerability ID (e.g. `&quot;CVE-2008-4318&quot;`)
- include vulnerability aliases when matching on a vulnerability ID (set `&quot;include-aliases&quot;` to `true`)
- namespace (e.g. `&quot;nvd&quot;`)
- fix state (allowed valu

## Installation

Use a package manager:

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install charmbracelet/tap/crush

# NPM
npm install -g @charmland/crush

# Arch Linux (btw)
yay -S crush-bin

# Nix
nix run github:numtide/nix-ai-tools#crush
```

Windows users:

```bash
# Winget
winget install charmbracelet.crush

# Scoop
scoop bucket add charm https://github.com/charmbracelet/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install crush
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nix (NUR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Crush is available via [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) in `nur.repos.charmbracelet.crush`.

You can also try out Crush via `nix-shell`:

```bash
# Add the NUR channel.
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/main.tar.gz nur
nix-channel --update

# Get Crush in a Nix shell.
nix-shell -p &#039;(import &lt;nur&gt; { pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}; }).repos.charmbracelet.crush&#039;
```

### NixOS &amp; Home Manager Module Usage via NUR

Crush provides NixOS and Home Manager modules via NUR.
You can use these modules directly in your flake by importing them from NUR. Since it auto detects whether its a home manager or nixos context you can use the import the exact same way :)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nur.url = &quot;github:nix-community/NUR&quot;;
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nur, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
      modules = [
        nur.modules.nixos.default
        nur.repos.charmbracelet.modules.crush
        {
          programs.crush = {
            enable = true;
            settings = {
              providers = {
                openai = {
                  id = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  name = &quot;OpenAI&quot;;
                  base_url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1&quot;;
                  type = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  api_key = &quot;sk-fake123456789abcdef...&quot;;
                  models = [
                    {
                      id = &quot;gpt-4&quot;;
                      name = &quot;GPT-4&quot;;
                    }
                  ];
                };
              };
              lsp = {
                go = { command = &quot;gopls&quot;; enabled = true; };
                nix = { command = &quot;nil&quot;; enabled = true; };
              };
              options = {
                context_paths = [ &quot;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&quot; ];
                tui = { compact_mode = true; };
                debug = false;
              };
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora/RHEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
echo &#039;[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key&#039; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, or OpenRouter and just start
Crush. You&#039;ll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

| Environment Variable        | Provider                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`         | Anthropic                                          |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`            | OpenAI                                             |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`        | OpenRouter                                         |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`            | Google Gemini                                      |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`          | Cerebras                                           |
| `HF_TOKEN`                  | Huggingface Inference                              |
| `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`          | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `VERTEXAI_LOCATION`         | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`              | Groq                                               |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`         | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`     | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_REGION`                | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_PROFILE`               | Amazon Bedrock (Custom Profile)                       |
| `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`  | Amazon Bedrock                                        |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI models                                |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`      | Azure OpenAI models (optional when using Entra ID) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`  | Azure OpenAI models                                |

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Catwalk Badge&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  &quot;this-setting&quot;: { &quot;this&quot;: &quot;that&quot; },
  &quot;that-setting&quot;: [&quot;ceci&quot;, &quot;cela&quot;]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;lsp&quot;: {
    &quot;go&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gopls&quot;,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GOTOOLCHAIN&quot;: &quot;go1.24.5&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;typescript&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;typescript-language-server&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;--stdio&quot;]
    },
    &quot;nix&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nil&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/mcp-server.js&quot;],
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [&quot;some-tool-name&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NODE_ENV&quot;: &quot;production&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [&quot;create_issue&quot;, &quot;create_pull_request&quot;],
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer $GH_PAT&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;streaming-service&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/sse&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;API-Key&quot;: &quot;$(echo $API_KEY)&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don&#039;t want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you&#039;d like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allowed_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;view&quot;,
      &quot;ls&quot;,
      &quot;grep&quot;,
      &quot;edit&quot;,
      &quot;mcp_context7_get-library-doc&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Disabling Built-In Tools

If you&#039;d like to prevent Crush from using certain built-in tools entirely, you
can disable them via the `options.disabled_tools` list. Disabled tools are
completely hidden from the agent.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;bash&quot;,
      &quot;sourcegraph&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

To disable tools from MCP servers, see the [MCP config section](#mcps).

### Initialization

When you initialize a project, Crush analyzes your codebase and creates
a context file that helps it work more effectively in future sessions.
By default, this file is named `AGENTS.md`, but you can customize the
name and location with the `initialize_as` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;initialize_as&quot;: &quot;AGENTS.md&quot;
  }
}
```

This is useful if you prefer a different naming convention or want to
place the file in a specific directory (e.g., `CRUSH.md` or
`docs/LLMs.md`). Crush will fill the file with project-specific context
like build commands, code patterns, and conventions it discovered during
initialization.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;attribution&quot;: {
      &quot;trailer_style&quot;: &quot;co-authored-by&quot;,
      &quot;generated_with&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

- `trailer_style`: Controls the attribution trailer added to commit messages
  (default: `assisted-by`)
	- `assisted-by`: Adds `Assisted-by: [Model Name] via Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	  (includes the model name)
	- `co-authored-by`: Adds `Co-Authored-By: Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	- `none`: No attribution trailer
- `generated_with`: When true (default), adds `💘 Generated with Crush` line to
  commit messages and PR descriptions

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Note that we support two &quot;types&quot; for OpenAI. Make sure to choose the right one
&gt; to ensure the best experience!
&gt; * `openai` should be used when proxying or routing requests through OpenAI.
&gt; * `openai-compat` should be used when using non-OpenAI providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don&#039;t forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;deepseek&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deepseek V3&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 0.27,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 0.07,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 64000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;custom-anthropic&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anthropic&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.anthropic.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;extra_headers&quot;: {
        &quot;anthropic-version&quot;: &quot;2023-06-01&quot;
      },
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Claude Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`
- Alternatively to `aws configure`, you can also just set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;vertexai&quot;: {
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4@20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VertexAI Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;ollama&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ollama&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen3:30b&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;lmstudio&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;LM Studio&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:1234/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;debug&quot;: true,
    &quot;debug_lsp&quot;: true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_provider_auto_update&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
crush update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
crush update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at crush at build time.
crush update-providers embedded

# For more info:
crush update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Crush records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code ([here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/blob/main/internal/llm/agent/event.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Or by setting the following in your config:

```json
{
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_metrics&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Crush also respects the [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://consoledonottrack.com)
convention which can be enabled via `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

# Welcome to the CloudNativePG Project!

**CloudNativePG (CNPG)** is an open-source platform designed to seamlessly
manage [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) databases in Kubernetes
environments. It covers the entire operational lifecycle—from deployment to
ongoing maintenance—through its core component, the CloudNativePG operator.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is the [Quickstart Guide](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/quickstart/).

## Scope

### Mission

CloudNativePG aims to increase PostgreSQL adoption within Kubernetes by making
it an integral part of the development process and GitOps-driven CI/CD
automation.

### Core Principles &amp; Features

Designed by PostgreSQL experts for Kubernetes administrators, CloudNativePG
follows a Kubernetes-native approach to PostgreSQL primary/standby cluster
management. Instead of relying on external high-availability tools (like
Patroni, repmgr, or Stolon), it integrates directly with the Kubernetes API to
automate database operations that a skilled DBA would perform manually.

Key design decisions include:

- Direct integration with Kubernetes API: The PostgreSQL cluster’s status is
  available directly in the `Cluster` resource, allowing users to inspect it
  via the Kubernetes API.
- Operator pattern: The operator ensures that the desired PostgreSQL state is
  reconciled automatically, following Kubernetes best practices.
- Immutable application containers: Updates follow an immutable infrastructure
  model, as explained in
  [&quot;Why EDB Chose Immutable Application Containers&quot;](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/why-edb-chose-immutable-application-containers).

### How CloudNativePG Works

The operator continuously monitors and updates the PostgreSQL cluster state.
Examples of automated actions include:

- Failover management: If the primary instance fails, the operator elects a new
  primary, updates the cluster status, and orchestrates the transition.
- Scaling read replicas: When the number of desired replicas changes, the
  operator provisions or removes resources such as persistent volumes, secrets,
  and config maps while managing streaming replication.
- Service updates: Kubernetes remains the single source of truth, ensuring
  that PostgreSQL service endpoints are always up to date.
- Rolling updates: When an image is updated, the operator follows a rolling
  strategy—first updating replica pods before performing a controlled
  switchover for the primary.

CloudNativePG manages additional Kubernetes resources to enhance PostgreSQL
management, including: `Backup`, `ClusterImageCatalog`, `Database`,
`ImageCatalog`, `Pooler`, `Publication`, `ScheduledBackup`, and `Subscription`.

## Out of Scope

- **Kubernetes only:** CloudNativePG is dedicated to vanilla Kubernetes
  maintained by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation
  (CNCF)](https://kubernetes.io/).
- **PostgreSQL only:** CloudNativePG is dedicated to vanilla PostgreSQL
  maintained by the [PostgreSQL Global Development Group
  (PGDG)](https://www.postgresql.org/about/).
- **No support for forks:** Features from PostgreSQL forks will only be
  considered if they can be integrated as extensions or pluggable frameworks.
- **Not a general-purpose database operator:** CloudNativePG does not support
  other databases (e.g., MariaDB).

CloudNativePG can be extended via the [CNPG-I plugin interface](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cnpg-i).

OpenTelemetry-Go is the [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
It provides a set of APIs to directly measure performance and behavior of your software and send this data to observability platforms.

## Project Status

| Signal  | Status             |
|---------|--------------------|
| Traces  | Stable             |
| Metrics | Stable             |
| Logs    | Beta[^1]           |

Progress and status specific to this repository is tracked in our
[project boards](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/projects)
and
[milestones](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/milestones).

Project versioning information and stability guarantees can be found in the
[versioning documentation](VERSIONING.md).

### Compatibility

OpenTelemetry-Go ensures compatibility with the current supported versions of
the [Go language](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy):

&gt; Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
&gt; For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release.

For versions of Go that are no longer supported upstream, opentelemetry-go will
stop ensuring compatibility with these versions in the following manner:

- A minor release of opentelemetry-go will be made to add support for the new
  supported release of Go.
- The following minor release of opentelemetry-go will remove compatibility
  testing for the oldest (now archived upstream) version of Go. This, and
  future, releases of opentelemetry-go may include features only supported by
  the currently supported versions of Go.

Currently, this project supports the following environments.

| OS       | Go Version | Architecture |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Ubuntu   | 1.25       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.25       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.25       | arm64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | arm64        |
| macOS    | 1.25       | amd64        |
| macOS    | 1.24       | amd64        |
| macOS    | 1.25       | arm64        |
| macOS    | 1.24       | arm64        |
| Windows  | 1.25       | amd64        |
| Windows  | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Windows  | 1.25       | 386          |
| Windows  | 1.24       | 386          |

While this project should work for other systems, no compatibility guarantees
are made for those systems currently.

## Getting Started

You can find a getting started guide on [opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/getting-started/).

OpenTelemetry&#039;s goal is to provide a single set of APIs to capture distributed
traces and metrics from your application and send them to an observability
platform. This project allows you to do just that for applications written in
Go. There are two steps to this process: instrument your application, and
configure an exporter.

### Instrumentation

To start capturing distributed traces and metric events from your application
it first needs to be instrumented. The easiest way to do this is by using an
instrumentation library for your code. Be sure to check out [the officially
supported instrumentation
libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

If you need to extend the telemetry an instrumentation library provides or want
to build your own instrumentation for your application directly you will need
to use the
[Go otel](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel)
package. The [examples](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/examples)
are a good way to see some practical uses of this process.

### Export

Now that your application is instrumented to collect telemetry, it needs an
export pipeline to send that telemetry to an observability platform.

All officially supported exporters for the OpenTelemetry project are contained in the [exporters directory](./exporters).

| Exporter                              | Logs | Metrics | Traces |
|---------------------------------------|:----:|:-------:|:------:|
| [OTLP](./exporters/otlp/)             |  ✓   |    ✓    |   ✓    |
| [Prometheus](./exporters/prometheus/) |      |    ✓    |        |
| [stdout](./exporters/stdout/)         |  ✓   |    ✓    |   ✓    |
| [Zipkin](./exporters/zipkin/)         |      |         |   ✓    |
