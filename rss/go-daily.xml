            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mangle

Mangle is a programming language for deductive database programming. It
is an extension of Datalog, with various extensions like aggregation, function
calls and optional type-checking.

Deductive database programming is useful for bringing data from multiple
data sources together since it enables us to represent and query that data in
a uniform way. It can also be used to model domain knowledge, similar
to machine-readable ontology but without being restricted to binary
predicates.

Datalog is an expressive declarative language similar to relational calculus
(think SQL and relational views). Unlike relational calculus, it also supports
recursive rules and program structuring in a straightforward way.

Mangle contains Datalog as a fragment and adds extensions that make its use
more practical. Some of the good properties like guaranteed termination are
lost when such extensions are used.

The goal of Mangle as an open source project is to convey the concepts in
a way that is accessible to developers and lends itself to easy experimentation.
This repository contains an implementation of Mangle as a go library that can be
easily embedded into applications.

Check out the [docs](docs/README.md) and the
[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/google/mangle/discussions) for more
information. There is also a Q&amp;A section.

For an example how to use Mangle library in a database-like grpc service,
see the separate [Mangle demo service repo](https://github.com/burakemir/mangle-service).

This is not an officially supported Google product.

## Examples

### Simple Queries

Imagine you were asked to spot software affected by the
[log4j vulnerability discovered in late 2021](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance).
We want to look for projects that contain a Java archive (jar file) of
log4j that is not updated to the patched version.

```prolog
projects_with_vulnerable_log4j(P) :-
  projects(P),
  contains_jar(P, &quot;log4j&quot;, Version),
  Version != &quot;2.17.1&quot;,
  Version != &quot;2.12.4&quot;,
  Version != &quot;2.3.2&quot;.
```

This is a Mangle *rule*: conceptually, the implementation retrieve all
possible values for variables `P` and `Version` that make all the subgoals true.

Simple Mangle rules like this correspond to select-project-join relational
queries. The same query in SQL would look like this:

```sql
SELECT projects.id as P
FROM projects JOIN contains_jar ON projects.id = contains_jar.project_id
WHERE contains_jar.version NOT IN (&quot;2.17.1&quot;, &quot;2.12.4&quot;, &quot;2.3.2&quot;)
```

Unlike SQL, our Mangle rule `projects_with_vulnerable_log4j` has a name
and can be referenced in other queries.

(If translating non-recursive Datalog into SQL queries sounds interesting, you
should check out the [Logica](https://logica.dev/) open source project.)

### Aggregation

In practice, querying is rarely enough and we also need grouping and
aggregation.

```
count_projects_with_vulnerable_log4j(Num) :-
  projects_with_vulnerable_log4j(P) |&gt; do fn:group_by(), let Num = fn:Count().
```

### Recursive Queries

The example does not specify what `contains_jar` does. Here is a possible
implementation for `contains_jar` that walks a dependency graph.
This shows that Mangle rules can be recursive. 

```
contains_jar(P, Name, Version) :-
  contains_jar_directly(P, Name, Version).

contains_jar(P, Name, Version) :-
  project_depends(P, Q),
  contains_jar(Q, Name, Version).
```

The two rules correspond to two cases in which a project may &quot;contain&quot; a jar:
either directly, or through some dependency.

### Knowledge Graphs, Property Graphs

In requirements engineering, one needs to captures real world concepts in a
domain model and controlled vocabulary. Description logics use
roles to describe how concepts interact, but these relationships are always
binary. Mangle can represent binary predicates, but also arbitrary n-ary
relations. Moreover it also has support for structured data.

```
one_or_two_leg_trip(Codes, Start, Destination, Price) :-
  direct_conn(Code, Start, Destination, Price)
  |&gt; let Codes = [Code].

one_or_two_leg_trip(Codes, Start, Destination, Price) :-
  direct_conn(FirstCode, Start, Connecting, FirstLegPrice).
  direct_conn(SecondCode, Connecting, Destination, SecondLegPrice)
  |&gt; let Code = [FirstCode, SecondCode],
     let Price = fn:plus(FirstLegPrice, SecondLegPrice).

```

```mermaid
graph LR
    /zurich --&gt;|/code/ZL &lt;br /&gt; 60 CHF| /lausanne
    /zurich --&gt;|/code/ZB &lt;br /&gt; 30 CHF| /bern
    /bern --&gt;|/code/BL &lt;br /&gt; 30 CHF| /lausanne
```

## Building &amp; Testing

Get the dependencies (see [go.mod](go.mod)), build the library, run tests:

```
go get -t ./...
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

### Regenerating the parser sources

If you want to regenerate the parser sources, you need to set up ANTLR first.
This requires a Java runtime environment.

```
wget http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar
alias antlr=&#039;java -jar $PWD/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar&#039;
antlr -Dlanguage=Go -package gen -o ./ parse/gen/Mangle.g4 -visitor
```

## Contributing

The Mangle maintainers welcome external contributions to spec, documentation
and this implementation (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)) and also other
implementations. Pull requests will be handled
[like for tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
to ensure our internal usage and tests will pass.

## Introduction

The traditional method of providing web interfaces to Go programs is via a built-in web server. Wails offers a different
approach: it provides the ability to wrap both Go code and a web frontend into a single binary. Tools are provided to
make this easy for you by handling project creation, compilation and bundling. All you have to do is get creative!

## Features

- Use standard Go for the backend
- Use any frontend technology you are already familiar with to build your UI
- Quickly create rich frontends for your Go programs using pre-built templates
- Easily call Go methods from Javascript
- Auto-generated Typescript definitions for your Go structs and methods
- Native Dialogs &amp; Menus
- Native Dark / Light mode support
- Supports modern translucency and &quot;frosted window&quot; effects
- Unified eventing system between Go and Javascript
- Powerful cli tool to quickly generate and build your projects
- Multiplatform
- Uses native rendering engines - _no embedded browser_!

### Roadmap

The project roadmap may be found [here](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions/1484). Please consult
it before creating an enhancement request.

## Getting Started

The installation instructions are on the [official website](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).

&lt;/p&gt;

## FAQ

- Is this an alternative to Electron?

  Depends on your requirements. It&#039;s designed to make it easy for Go programmers to make lightweight desktop
  applications or add a frontend to their existing applications. Wails does offer native elements such as menus
  and dialogs, so it could be considered a lightweight electron alternative.

- Who is this project aimed at?

  Go programmers who want to bundle an HTML/JS/CSS frontend with their applications, without resorting to creating a
  server and opening a browser to view it.

- What&#039;s with the name?

  When I saw WebView, I thought &quot;What I really want is tooling around building a WebView app, a bit like Rails is to
  Ruby&quot;. So initially it was a play on words (Webview on Rails). It just so happened to also be a homophone of the
  English name for the [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) I am from. So it stuck.

## Benchmarks 

Some good benchmarks VictoriaMetrics achieved:

* **Minimal memory footprint**: handling millions of unique timeseries with [10x less RAM](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) than InfluxDB, up to [7x less RAM](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Highly scalable and performance** for [data ingestion](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and [querying](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4), [20x outperforms](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.
* **High data compression**: [70x more data points](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4) may be stored into limited storage than TimescaleDB, [7x less storage](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) space is required than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Reducing storage costs**: [10x more effective](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/casestudies/#grammarly) than Graphite according to the Grammarly case study.
* **A single-node VictoriaMetrics** can replace medium-sized clusters built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. See [VictoriaMetrics vs Thanos](https://medium.com/@valyala/comparing-thanos-to-victoriametrics-cluster-b193bea1683), [Measuring vertical scalability](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae), [Remote write storage wars - PromCon 2019](https://promcon.io/2019-munich/talks/remote-write-storage-wars/).
* **Optimized for storage**: [Works well with high-latency IO](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and low IOPS (HDD and network storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.).

## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

A Go (Golang) Backend Clean Architecture project with Gin, MongoDB, JWT Authentication Middleware, Test, and Docker.

![Go Backend Clean Architecture](https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/go-backend-clean-architecture/blob/main/assets/go-backend-clean-architecture.png?raw=true)

**You can use this project as a template to build your Backend project in the Go language on top of this project.**

Before creating this project, I have gone through more than 20 projects related to the Go(Golang) Clean Architecture on GitHub.

Thanks to all those projects, I learned a lot from all of those. As I keep saying:

&gt; The best way to learn to code is to code. But, to write good code, you will also have to read good code. Make a habit of reading good code. You can find many open-source projects on GitHub and start reading.

Then for the implementation part, I combined all of my ideas, experiences, and learnings from those projects to create this project.

And as always I would love to get feedback on my project. This helps everyone and most importantly me.

Learn about this project architecture in detail from the blogs mentioned below:

## Major Packages used in this project

- **gin**: Gin is an HTTP web framework written in Go (Golang). It features a Martini-like API with much better performance -- up to 40 times faster. If you need a smashing performance, get yourself some Gin.
- **mongo go driver**: The Official Golang driver for MongoDB.
- **jwt**: JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry-standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties. Used for Access Token and Refresh Token.
- **viper**: For loading configuration from the `.env` file. Go configuration with fangs. Find, load, and unmarshal a configuration file in JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile, or Java properties formats.
- **bcrypt**: Package bcrypt implements Provos and Mazières&#039;s bcrypt adaptive hashing algorithm.
- **testify**: A toolkit with common assertions and mocks that plays nicely with the standard library.
- **mockery**: A mock code autogenerator for Golang used in testing.
- Check more packages in `go.mod`.

### How to run this project?

We can run this Go Backend Clean Architecture project with or without Docker. Here, I am providing both ways to run this project.

- Clone this project

```bash
# Move to your workspace
cd your-workspace

# Clone this project into your workspace
git clone https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/go-backend-clean-architecture.git

# Move to the project root directory
cd go-backend-clean-architecture
```

#### Run without Docker

- Create a file `.env` similar to `.env.example` at the root directory with your configuration.
- Install `go` if not installed on your machine.
- Install `MongoDB` if not installed on your machine.
- Important: Change the `DB_HOST` to `localhost` (`DB_HOST=localhost`) in `.env` configuration file. `DB_HOST=mongodb` is needed only when you run with Docker.
- Run `go run cmd/main.go`.
- Access API using `http://localhost:8080`

#### Run with Docker

- Create a file `.env` similar to `.env.example` at the root directory with your configuration.
- Install Docker and Docker Compose.
- Run `docker-compose up -d`.
- Access API using `http://localhost:8080`

### How to run the test?

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...
```

### How to generate the mock code?

In this project, to test, we need to generate mock code for the use-case, repository, and database.

```bash
# Generate mock code for the usecase and repository
mockery --dir=domain --output=domain/mocks --outpkg=mocks --all

# Generate mock code for the database
mockery --dir=mongo --output=mongo/mocks --outpkg=mocks --all
```

Whenever you make changes in the interfaces of these use-cases, repositories, or databases, you need to run the corresponding command to regenerate the mock code for testing.

[**Click me to see the hotkey wiki**](https://superfile.netlify.app/configure/custom-hotkeys/)

## Notes

We have an auto update functionality, that fetches superfile&#039;s latest released version from github (if last timestamp of last version check was less than 24 hours) and prints a prompt to user, if there is a newer version available.

You can turn this off, by setting `auto_check_update` to false in superfile config. [**Click me to see the config wiki**](https://superfile.netlify.app/configure/superfile-config/)

Full-featured and highly configurable event-driven file transfer solution.
Server protocols: SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S, WebDAV.
Storage backends: local filesystem, encrypted local filesystem, S3 (compatible) Object Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, other SFTP servers.

With SFTPGo you can leverage local and cloud storage backends for exchanging and storing files internally or with business partners using the same tools and processes you are already familiar with.

The WebAdmin UI allows to easily create and manage your users, folders, groups and other resources.

The WebClient UI allows end users to change their credentials, browse and manage their files in the browser and setup two-factor authentication which works with Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Authy and other compatible apps.

## Sponsors

We strongly believe in Open Source software model, so we decided to make SFTPGo available to everyone, but maintaining and evolving SFTPGo takes a lot of time and work. To make development and maintenance sustainable you should consider to support the project with a [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/drakkan).

We love doing the work and we&#039;d like to keep doing it - your support helps make SFTPGo possible.

It is important to understand that you should support SFTPGo and any other Open Source project you rely on for ongoing maintenance, even if you don&#039;t have any questions or need new features, to mitigate the business risk of a project you depend on going unmaintained, with its security and development velocity implications.

CoreDNS is a DNS server/forwarder, written in Go, that chains [plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins).
Each plugin performs a (DNS) function.

CoreDNS is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) graduated project.

CoreDNS is a fast and flexible DNS server. The key word here is *flexible*: with CoreDNS you
are able to do what you want with your DNS data by utilizing plugins. If some functionality is not
provided out of the box you can add it by [writing a plugin](https://coredns.io/explugins).

CoreDNS can listen for DNS requests coming in over:
* UDP/TCP (go&#039;old DNS).
* TLS - DoT ([RFC 7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)).
* DNS over HTTP/2 - DoH ([RFC 8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484)).
* DNS over QUIC - DoQ ([RFC 9250](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9250)). 
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io) (not a standard).

Currently CoreDNS is able to:

* Serve zone data from a file; both DNSSEC (NSEC only) and DNS are supported (*file* and *auto*).
* Retrieve zone data from primaries, i.e., act as a secondary server (AXFR only) (*secondary*).
* Sign zone data on-the-fly (*dnssec*).
* Load balancing of responses (*loadbalance*).
* Allow for zone transfers, i.e., act as a primary server (*file* + *transfer*).
* Automatically load zone files from disk (*auto*).
* Caching of DNS responses (*cache*).
* Use etcd as a backend (replacing [SkyDNS](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns)) (*etcd*).
* Use k8s (kubernetes) as a backend (*kubernetes*).
* Serve as a proxy to forward queries to some other (recursive) nameserver (*forward*).
* Provide metrics (by using Prometheus) (*prometheus*).
* Provide query (*log*) and error (*errors*) logging.
* Integrate with cloud providers (*route53*).
* Support the CH class: `version.bind` and friends (*chaos*).
* Support the RFC 5001 DNS name server identifier (NSID) option (*nsid*).
* Profiling support (*pprof*).
* Rewrite queries (qtype, qclass and qname) (*rewrite* and *template*).
* Block ANY queries (*any*).
* Provide DNS64 IPv6 Translation (*dns64*).

And more. Each of the plugins is documented. See [coredns.io/plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins)
for all in-tree plugins, and [coredns.io/explugins](https://coredns.io/explugins) for all
out-of-tree plugins.

## Compilation from Source

To compile CoreDNS, we assume you have a working Go setup. See various tutorials if you don’t have
that already configured.

First, make sure your golang version is 1.24.0 or higher as `go mod` support and other api is needed.
See [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for `go mod` details.
Then, check out the project and run `make` to compile the binary:

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/coredns/coredns
$ cd coredns
$ make
~~~

&gt; **_NOTE:_**  extra plugins may be enabled when building by setting the `COREDNS_PLUGINS` environment variable with comma separate list of plugins in the same format as plugin.cfg

This should yield a `coredns` binary.

## Compilation with Docker

CoreDNS requires Go to compile. However, if you already have docker installed and prefer not to
setup a Go environment, you could build CoreDNS easily:

```
docker run --rm -i -t \
    -v $PWD:/go/src/github.com/coredns/coredns -w /go/src/github.com/coredns/coredns \
        golang:1.24 sh -c &#039;GOFLAGS=&quot;-buildvcs=false&quot; make gen &amp;&amp; GOFLAGS=&quot;-buildvcs=false&quot; make&#039;
```

The above command alone will have `coredns` binary generated.

## Examples

When starting CoreDNS without any configuration, it loads the
[*whoami*](https://coredns.io/plugins/whoami) and [*log*](https://coredns.io/plugins/log) plugins
and starts listening on port 53 (override with `-dns.port`), it should show the following:

~~~ txt
.:53
CoreDNS-1.6.6
linux/amd64, go1.16.10, aa8c32
~~~

The following could be used to query the CoreDNS server that is running now:

~~~ txt
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 www.example.com
~~~

Any query sent to port 53 should return some information; your sending address, port and protocol
used. The query should also be logged to standard output.

The configuration of CoreDNS is done through a file named `Corefile`. When CoreDNS starts, it will
look for the `Corefile` from the current working directory. A `Corefile` for CoreDNS server that listens
on port `53` and enables `whoami` plugin is:

~~~ corefile
.:53 {
    whoami
}
~~~

Sometimes port number 53 is occupied by system processes. In that case you can start the CoreDNS server
while modifying the `Corefile` as given below so that the CoreDNS server starts on port 1053.

~~~ corefile
.:1053 {
    whoami
}
~~~

If you have a `Corefile` without a port number specified it will, by default, use port 53, but you can
override the port with the `-dns.port` flag: `coredns -dns.port 1053`, runs the server on port 1053.

You may import other text files into the `Corefile` using the _import_ directive.  You can use globs to match multiple
files with a single _import_ directive.

~~~ txt
.:53 {
    import example1.txt
}
import example2.txt
~~~

You can use environment variables in the `Corefile` with `{$VARIABLE}`.  Note that each environment variable is inserted
into the `Corefile` as a single token. For example, an environment variable with a space in it will be treated as a single
token, not as two separate tokens.

~~~ txt
.:53 {
    {$ENV_VAR}
}
~~~

A Corefile for a CoreDNS server that forward any queries to an upstream DNS (e.g., `8.8.8.8`) is as follows:

~~~ corefile
.:53 {
    forward . 8.8.8.8:53
    log
}
~~~

Start CoreDNS and then query on that port (53). The query should be forwarded to 8.8.8.8 and the
response will be returned. Each query should also show up in the log which is printed on standard
output.

To serve the (NSEC) DNSSEC-signed `example.org` on port 1053, with errors and logging sent to standard
output. Allow zone transfers to everybody, but specifically mention 1 IP address so that CoreDNS can
send notifies to it.

~~~ txt
example.org:1053 {
    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed
    transfer {
        to * 2001:500:8f::53
    }
    errors
    log
}
~~~

Serve `example.org` on port 1053, but forward everything that does *not* match `example.org` to a
recursive nameserver *and* rewrite ANY queries to HINFO.

~~~ txt
example.org:1053 {
    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed
    transfer {
        to * 2001:500:8f::53
    }
    errors
    log
}

. {
    any
    forward . 8.8.8.8:53
    errors
    log
}
~~~

IP addresses are also allowed. They are automatically converted to reverse zones:

~~~ corefile
10.0.0.0/24 {
    whoami
}
~~~
Means you are authoritative for `0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.`.

This also works for IPv6 addresses. If for some reason you want to serve a zone named `10.0.0.0/24`
add the closing dot: `10.0.0.0/24.` as this also stops the conversion.

This even works for CIDR (See RFC 1518 and 1519) addressing, i.e. `10.0.0.0/25`, CoreDNS will then
check if the `in-addr` request falls in the correct range.

Listening on TLS (DoT) and for gRPC? Use:

~~~ corefile
tls://example.org grpc://example.org {
    whoami
}
~~~

Similarly, for QUIC (DoQ):

~~~ corefile
quic://example.org {
    whoami
    tls mycert mykey
}
~~~

And for DNS over HTTP/2 (DoH) use:

~~~ corefile
https://example.org {
    whoami
    tls mycert mykey
}
~~~
in this setup, the CoreDNS will be responsible for TLS termination

you can also start DNS server serving DoH without TLS termination (plain HTTP), but beware that in such scenario there has to be some kind
of TLS termination proxy before CoreDNS instance, which forwards DNS requests otherwise clients will not be able to communicate via DoH with the server
~~~ corefile
https://example.org {
    whoami
}
~~~

Specifying ports works in the same way:

~~~ txt
grpc://example.org:1443 https://example.org:1444 {
    # ...
}
~~~

When no transport protocol is specified the default `dns://` is assumed.

guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Deployment

Examples for deployment via systemd and other use cases can be found in the [deployment
repository](https://github.com/coredns/deployment).

## Deprecation Policy

When there is a backwards incompatible change in CoreDNS the following process is followed:

*  Release x.y.z: Announce that in the next release we will make backward incompatible changes.
*  Release x.y+1.0: Increase the minor version and set the patch version to 0. Make the changes,
   but allow the old configuration to be parsed. I.e. CoreDNS will start from an unchanged
   Corefile.
*  Release x.y+1.1: Increase the patch version to 1. Remove the lenient parsing, so CoreDNS will
   not start if those features are still used.

E.g. 1.3.1 announce a change. 1.4.0 a new release with the change but backward compatible config.
And finally 1.4.1 that removes the config workarounds.

# Introduction

pprof is a tool for visualization and analysis of profiling data.

pprof reads a collection of profiling samples in profile.proto format and
generates reports to visualize and help analyze the data. It can generate both
text and graphical reports (through the use of the dot visualization package).

profile.proto is a protocol buffer that describes a set of callstacks
and symbolization information. A common usage is to represent a set of
sampled callstacks from statistical profiling. The format is
described on the [proto/profile.proto](./proto/profile.proto) file. For details on protocol
buffers, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers

Profiles can be read from a local file, or over http. Multiple
profiles of the same type can be aggregated or compared.

If the profile samples contain machine addresses, pprof can symbolize
them through the use of the native binutils tools (addr2line and nm).

**This is not an official Google product.**

# Building pprof

Prerequisites:

- Go development kit of a [supported version](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy).
  Follow [these instructions](http://golang.org/doc/code.html) to prepare
  the environment.

- Graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org/
  Optional, used to generate graphic visualizations of profiles

To build and install it:

    go install github.com/google/pprof@latest

The binary will be installed `$GOPATH/bin` (`$HOME/go/bin` by default).

# Basic usage

pprof can read a profile from a file or directly from a server via http.
Specify the profile input(s) in the command line, and use options to
indicate how to format the report.

## Generate a text report of the profile, sorted by hotness:

```
% pprof -top [main_binary] profile.pb.gz
Where
    main_binary:  Local path to the main program binary, to enable symbolization
    profile.pb.gz: Local path to the profile in a compressed protobuf, or
                   URL to the http service that serves a profile.
```

## Generate a graph in an SVG file, and open it with a web browser:

```
pprof -web [main_binary] profile.pb.gz
```

## Run pprof on interactive mode:

If no output formatting option is specified, pprof runs on interactive mode,
where reads the profile and accepts interactive commands for visualization and
refinement of the profile.

```
pprof [main_binary] profile.pb.gz

This will open a simple shell that takes pprof commands to generate reports.
Type &#039;help&#039; for available commands/options.
```

## Run pprof via a web interface

If the `-http` flag is specified, pprof starts a web server at
the specified host:port that provides an interactive web-based interface to pprof.
Host is optional, and is &quot;localhost&quot; by default. Port is optional, and is a
random available port by default. `-http=&quot;:&quot;` starts a server locally at
a random port.

```
pprof -http=[host]:[port] [main_binary] profile.pb.gz
```

The preceding command should automatically open your web browser at
the right page; if not, you can manually visit the specified port in
your web browser.

## Using pprof with Linux Perf

pprof can read `perf.data` files generated by the
[Linux perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) tool by using the
`perf_to_profile` program from the
[perf_data_converter](https://github.com/google/perf_data_converter) package.

## Viewing disassembly on Windows

To view disassembly of profiles collected from Go programs compiled as Windows executables,
the executable must be built with `go build -buildmode=exe`. LLVM or GCC must be installed,
so required tools like `addr2line` and `nm` are available to `pprof`.

## Further documentation

See [doc/README.md](doc/README.md) for more detailed end-user documentation.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution documentation.

See [proto/README.md](proto/README.md) for a description of the profile.proto format.

### Build an application

Now that you have hopefully digested the _Go Fundamentals_ section you have a solid grounding of a majority of Go&#039;s language features and how to do TDD.

This next section will involve building an application.

Each chapter will iterate on the previous one, expanding the application&#039;s functionality as our product owner dictates.

New concepts will be introduced to help facilitate writing great code but most of the new material will be learning what can be accomplished from Go&#039;s standard library.

By the end of this, you should have a strong grasp as to how to iteratively write an application in Go, backed by tests.

* [HTTP server](http-server.md) - We will create an application which listens to HTTP requests and responds to them.
* [JSON, routing and embedding](json.md) - We will make our endpoints return JSON and explore how to do routing.
* [IO and sorting](io.md) - We will persist and read our data from disk and we&#039;ll cover sorting data.
* [Command line &amp; project structure](command-line.md) - Support multiple applications from one code base and read input from command line.
* [Time](time.md) - using the `time` package to schedule activities.
* [WebSockets](websockets.md) - learn how to write and test a server that uses WebSockets.

### Testing fundamentals

* [Refactoring Checklist](refactoring-checklist.md) - Some discussion on what refactoring is, and some basic tips on how to do it.

### Questions and answers

I often run in to questions on the internets like

&gt; How do I test my amazing function that does x, y and z

If you have such a question raise it as an issue on github and I&#039;ll try and find time to write a short chapter to tackle the issue. I feel like content like this is valuable as it is tackling people&#039;s _real_ questions around testing.

* [OS exec](os-exec.md) - An example of how we can reach out to the OS to execute commands to fetch data and keep our business logic testable/
* [Error types](error-types.md) - Example of creating your own error types to improve your tests and make your code easier to work with.
* [Context-aware Reader](context-aware-reader.md) - Learn how to TDD augmenting `io.Reader` with cancellation. Based on [Context-aware io.Reader for Go](https://pace.dev/blog/2020/02/03/context-aware-ioreader-for-golang-by-mat-ryer)
* [Revisiting HTTP Handlers](http-handlers-revisited.md) - Testing HTTP handlers seems to be the bane of many a developer&#039;s existence. This chapter explores the issues around designing handlers correctly.

## Background

I have some experience introducing Go to development teams and have tried different approaches as to how to grow a team from some people curious about Go into highly effective writers of Go systems.

### What didn&#039;t work

#### Read _the_ book

An approach we tried was to take [the blue book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440) and every week discuss the next chapter along with the exercises.

I love this book but it requires a high level of commitment. The book is very detailed in explaining concepts, which is obviously great but it means that the progress is slow and steady - this is not for everyone.

I found that whilst a small number of people would read chapter X and do the exercises, many people didn&#039;t.

#### Solve some problems

Katas are fun but they are usually limited in their scope for learning a language; you&#039;re unlikely to use goroutines to solve a kata.

Another problem is when you have varying levels of enthusiasm. Some people just learn way more of the language than others and when demonstrating what they have done end up confusing people with features the others are not familiar with.

This ends up making the learning feel quite _unstructured_ and _ad hoc_.

### What did work

By far the most effective way was by slowly introducing the fundamentals of the language by reading through [go by example](https://gobyexample.com/), exploring them with examples and discussing them as a group. This was a more interactive approach than &quot;read chapter x for homework&quot;.

Over time the team gained a solid foundation of the _grammar_ of the language so we could then start to build systems.

This to me seems analogous to practicing scales when trying to learn guitar.

It doesn&#039;t matter how artistic you think you are, you are unlikely to write good music without understanding the fundamentals and practicing the mechanics.

### What works for me

When _I_ learn a new programming language I usually start by messing around in a REPL but eventually, I need more structure.

What I like to do is explore concepts and then solidify the ideas with tests. Tests verify the code I write is correct and documents the feature I have learned.

Taking my experience of learning with a group and my own personal way I am going to try and create something that hopefully proves useful to other teams. Learning the fundamentals by writing small tests so that you can then take your existing software design skills and ship some great systems.

## Who this is for

* People who are interested in picking up Go.
* People who already know some Go, but want to explore testing with TDD.

## What you&#039;ll need

* A computer!
* [Installed Go](https://golang.org/)
* A text editor
* Some experience with programming. Understanding of concepts like `if`, variables, functions etc.
* Comfortable using the terminal

## Introduction

Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.

We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:

* [SSH nodes](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).
* [Kubernetes clusters](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction/)
* [PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/database-access/).
* [Internal Web apps](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/application-access/introduction/).
* [Windows Hosts](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/desktop-access/introduction/).
* [Networked servers](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).

You can set up Teleport as a [Linux daemon](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo) or a [Kubernetes deployment](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/).

Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:

- No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
- Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
- Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.

Teleport uses [Go crypto](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto). It is _fully compatible with OpenSSH_, `sshd` servers, and `ssh` clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.

## Docker

### Deploy Teleport

If you wish to deploy Teleport inside a Docker container see the
[installation guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/#running-teleport-on-docker).

### For Local Testing and Development

To run a full test suite locally, see [the test dependencies list](BUILD_macos.md#local-tests-dependencies)

## Building Teleport

The `teleport` repository contains the Teleport daemon binary (written in Go)
and a web UI written in TypeScript.

If your intention is to build and deploy for use in a production infrastructure
a released tag should be used.  The default branch, `master`, is the current
development branch for an upcoming major version.  Get the latest release tags
listed at https://goteleport.com/download/ and then use that tag in the `git clone`.
For example `git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git -b v16.0.0` gets release v16.0.0.

### Dockerized Build

It is often easiest to build with Docker, which ensures that all required
tooling is available for the build. To execute a dockerized build, ensure
that docker is installed and running, and execute:

```
make -C build.assets build-binaries
```

### Local Build

#### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to build Teleport from source. For
maximum compatibility, install the versions of these dependencies using the
versions listed in [`build.assets/versions.mk`](/build.assets/versions.mk):

1. [`Go`](https://golang.org/dl/)
1. [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack)
1. [`libfido2`](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2)
1. [`pkg-config`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)

For an example of Dev Environment setup on a Mac, see [these
instructions](/BUILD_macos.md).

##### Linux 64-bit ARM Dependencies

1. On Linux aarch64 (64-bit ARM), you may need to manually install
   [`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). Check with `which
   wasm-opt`. If not found, install with `apt-get install binaryen`
   (Debian-based systems). On other platforms, `wasm-pack` installs it
   automatically.

#### Perform a build

&gt;**Important**
&gt;
&gt;* The Go compiler is somewhat sensitive to the amount of memory: you will need
   **at least** 1GB of virtual memory to compile Teleport. A 512MB instance
   without swap will **not** work.
&gt;* This will build the latest version of Teleport, **regardless** of whether it
   is stable. If you want to build the latest stable release, run `git checkout`
   and `git submodule update --recursive` to the corresponding tag (for example,
&gt;* run `git checkout v8.0.0`) **before** performing a build.

Get the source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git
cd teleport
```

To perform a build

```shell
make full
```

`tsh` dynamically links against libfido2 by default, to support development
environments, as long as the library itself can be found:

```shell
$ brew install libfido2 pkg-config  # Replace with your package manager of choice

$ make build/tsh
&gt; libfido2 found, setting FIDO2=dynamic
&gt; (...)
```

Release binaries are linked statically against libfido2. You may switch the
linking mode using the FIDO2 variable:

```shell
make build/tsh FIDO2=dynamic # dynamic linking
make build/tsh FIDO2=static  # static linking, for an easy setup use `make enter`
                             # or `build.assets/macos/build-fido2-macos.sh`.
make build/tsh FIDO2=off     # doesn&#039;t link libfido2 in any way
```

`tsh` builds with Touch ID support require access to an Apple Developer account.
If you are a Teleport maintainer, ask the team for access.

#### Build output and run locally

If the build succeeds, the installer will place the binaries in the `build` directory.

Before starting, create default data directories:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p -m0700 /var/lib/teleport
sudo chown $USER /var/lib/teleport
```

#### Running Teleport in a hot reload mode

To speed up your development process, you can run Teleport using
[`CompileDaemon`](https://github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon). This will build
and run the Teleport binary, and then rebuild and restart it whenever any Go
source files change.

1. Install CompileDaemon:

    ```shell
    go install github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon@latest
    ```

    Note that we use `go install` instead of the suggested `go get`, because we
    don&#039;t want CompileDaemon to become a dependency of the project.

1. Build and run the Teleport binary:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload
    ```

    By default, this runs a `teleport start` command. If you want to customize
    the command, for example by providing a custom config file location, you can
    use the `TELEPORT_ARGS` parameter:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload TELEPORT_ARGS=&#039;start --config=/path/to/config.yaml&#039;
    ```

Note that you still need to run [`make grpc`](api/proto/README.md) if you modify
any Protocol Buffers files to regenerate the generated Go sources; regenerating
these sources should in turn cause the CompileDaemon to rebuild and restart
Teleport.

### Web UI

The Teleport Web UI resides in the [web](web) directory.

#### Rebuilding Web UI for development

To rebuild the Teleport UI package, run the following command:

```bash
make docker-ui
```

Then you can replace Teleport Web UI files with the files from the newly-generated `/dist` folder.

To enable speedy iterations on the Web UI, you can run a [local web-dev server](web#web-ui).

You can also tell Teleport to load the Web UI assets from the source directory.
To enable this behavior, set the environment variable `DEBUG=1` and rebuild with the default target:

```bash
# Run Teleport as a single-node cluster in development mode:
DEBUG=1 ./build/teleport start -d
```

Keep the server running in this mode, and make your UI changes in `/dist` directory.
For instructions about how to update the Web UI, read [the `web` README](web#readme).

### Managing dependencies

All dependencies are managed using [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules). Here are the instructions for some common tasks:

#### Add a new dependency

Latest version:

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency
```

and update the source to use this dependency.


To get a specific version, use `go get github.com/new/dependency@version` instead.

#### Set dependency to a specific version

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency@version
```

#### Update dependency to the latest version

```bash
go get -u github.com/new/dependency
```

#### Update all dependencies

```bash
go get -u all
```

#### Debugging dependencies

Why is a specific package imported?

`go mod why $pkgname`

Why is a specific module imported?

`go mod why -m $modname`

Why is a specific version of a module imported?

`go mod graph | grep $modname`

### Devbox Build (experimental)

**Note**: Devbox support is still experimental. It&#039;s very possible things may not work as intended.

Teleport can be built using [devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox). To use devbox, follow
the instructions to install devbox [here](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/docs/quickstart/) and
then run:

`devbox shell`

This will install Teleport&#039;s various build dependencies and drop you into a shell with these
dependencies. From here, you can build Teleport normally.

#### flake.nix

A nix flake is located in `build.assets/flake` that allows for installation of Teleport&#039;s less
common build tooling. If this flake is updated, run:

`devbox install`

in order to make sure the changes in the flake are reflected in the local devbox shell.

## Why did We Build Teleport?

The Teleport creators used to work together at Rackspace. We noticed that most cloud computing users struggle with setting up and configuring infrastructure security because popular tools, while flexible, are complex to understand and expensive to maintain. Additionally, most organizations use multiple infrastructure form factors such as several cloud providers, multiple cloud accounts, servers in colocation, and even smart devices. Some of those devices run on untrusted networks, behind third-party firewalls. This only magnifies complexity and increases operational overhead.

We had a choice, either start a security consulting business or build a solution that&#039;s dead-easy to use and understand. A real-time representation of all of your servers in the same room as you, as if they were magically _teleported_. Thus, Teleport was born!

![OAuth2 Proxy](docs/static/img/logos/OAuth2_Proxy_horizontal.svg)

OAuth2-Proxy is a flexible, open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. It provides a simple and secure way to protect your web applications with OAuth2 / OIDC authentication. As a reverse proxy, it intercepts requests to your application and redirects users to an OAuth2 provider for authentication. As a middleware, it can be seamlessly integrated into your existing infrastructure to handle authentication for multiple applications.

OAuth2-Proxy supports a lot of OAuth2 as well as OIDC providers. Either through a generic OIDC client or a specific implementation for Google, Microsoft Entra ID, GitHub, login.gov and others. Through specialised provider implementations oauth2-proxy can extract more details about the user like preferred usernames and groups. Those details can then be forwarded as HTTP headers to your upstream applications.

![Simplified Architecture](docs/static/img/simplified-architecture.svg)

## Get Started

OAuth2-Proxy&#039;s [Installation Docs](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/installation) cover how to install and configure your setup. Additionally you can take a further look at the [example setup files](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/tree/master/contrib/local-environment).

## Releases

### Binaries
We publish oauth2-proxy as compiled binaries on GitHub for all major architectures as well as more exotic ones like `ppc64le` as well as `s390x`.

Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/latest).

### Images

From `v7.6.0` and up the base image has been changed from Alpine to [GoogleContainerTools/distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).
This image comes with even fewer installed dependencies and thus should improve security. The image therefore is also slightly smaller than Alpine.
For debugging purposes (and those who really need it. e.g. `armv6`) we still provide images based on Alpine. The tags of these images are suffixed with `-alpine`.

Since 2023-11-18 we build nightly images directly from the `master` branch and provide them at `quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy-nightly`.
These images are considered unstable and therefore should **NOT** be used for production purposes unless you know what you&#039;re doing.

![Moby Project logo](docs/static_files/moby-project-logo.png &quot;The Moby Project&quot;)

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.

It provides a &quot;Lego set&quot; of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.

## Principles

Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set its direction.

- Modular: the project includes lots of components that have well-defined functions and APIs that work together.
- Batteries included but swappable: Moby includes enough components to build fully featured container systems, but its modular architecture ensures that most of the components can be swapped by different implementations.
- Usable security: Moby provides secure defaults without compromising usability.
- Developer focused: The APIs are intended to be functional and useful to build powerful tools.
They are not necessarily intended as end user tools but as components aimed at developers.
Documentation and UX is aimed at developers not end users.

## Audience

The Moby Project is intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent and build systems based on containers.
It is not for people looking for a commercially supported system, but for people who want to work and learn with open source code.

## Relationship with Docker

The components and tools in the Moby Project are initially the open source components that Docker and the community have built for the Docker Project.
New projects can be added if they fit with the community goals. Docker is committed to using Moby as the upstream for the Docker Product.
However, other projects are also encouraged to use Moby as an upstream, and to reuse the components in diverse ways, and all these uses will be treated in the same way. External maintainers and contributors are welcomed.

The Moby project is not intended as a location for support or feature requests for Docker products, but as a place for contributors to work on open source code, fix bugs, and make the code more useful.
The releases are supported by the maintainers, community and users, on a best efforts basis only. For customers who want enterprise or commercial support, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/) are the appropriate products for these use cases.

## 🎯 What is Nightingale

Nightingale is an open-source monitoring project that focuses on alerting. Similar to Grafana, Nightingale also connects with various existing data sources. However, while Grafana emphasizes visualization, Nightingale places greater emphasis on the alerting engine, as well as the processing and distribution of alarms.

&gt; The Nightingale project was initially developed and open-sourced by DiDi.inc. On May 11, 2022, it was donated to the Open Source Development Committee of the China Computer Federation (CCF ODC).

![](https://n9e.github.io/img/global/arch-bg.png)

## 💡 How Nightingale Works

Many users have already collected metrics and log data. In this case, you can connect your storage repositories (such as VictoriaMetrics, ElasticSearch, etc.) as data sources in Nightingale. This allows you to configure alerting rules and notification rules within Nightingale, enabling the generation and distribution of alarms.

![Nightingale Product Architecture](doc/img/readme/20240221152601.png)

Nightingale itself does not provide monitoring data collection capabilities. We recommend using [Categraf](https://github.com/flashcatcloud/categraf) as the collector, which integrates seamlessly with Nightingale.

[Categraf](https://github.com/flashcatcloud/categraf) can collect monitoring data from operating systems, network devices, various middleware, and databases. It pushes this data to Nightingale via the `Prometheus Remote Write` protocol. Nightingale then stores the monitoring data in a time-series database (such as Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, etc.) and provides alerting and visualization capabilities.

For certain edge data centers with poor network connectivity to the central Nightingale server, we offer a distributed deployment mode for the alerting engine. In this mode, even if the network is disconnected, the alerting functionality remains unaffected.

![Edge Deployment Mode](doc/img/readme/20240222102119.png)

&gt; In the above diagram, Data Center A has a good network with the central data center, so it uses the Nightingale process in the central data center as the alerting engine. Data Center B has a poor network with the central data center, so it deploys `n9e-edge` as the alerting engine to handle alerting for its own data sources.

## 🔕 Alert Noise Reduction, Escalation, and Collaboration

Nightingale focuses on being an alerting engine, responsible for generating alarms and flexibly distributing them based on rules. It supports 20 built-in notification medias (such as phone calls, SMS, email, DingTalk, Slack, etc.).

If you have more advanced requirements, such as:
- Want to consolidate events from multiple monitoring systems into one platform for unified noise reduction, response handling, and data analysis.
- Want to support personnel scheduling, practice on-call culture, and support alert escalation (to avoid missing alerts) and collaborative handling.

Then Nightingale is not suitable. It is recommended that you choose on-call products such as PagerDuty and FlashDuty. These products are simple and easy to use.

## 🗨️ Communication Channels

- **Report Bugs:** It is highly recommended to submit issues via the [Nightingale GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/ccfos/nightingale/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=kind%2Fbug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml).
- **Documentation:** For more information, we recommend thoroughly browsing the [Nightingale Documentation Site](https://n9e.github.io/).

## 🔑 Key Features

![Nightingale Alerting rules](doc/img/readme/2025-05-23_18-43-37.png)

- Nightingale supports alerting rules, mute rules, subscription rules, and notification rules. It natively supports 20 types of notification media and allows customization of message templates.  
- It supports event pipelines for Pipeline processing of alarms, facilitating automated integration with in-house systems. For example, it can append metadata to alarms or perform relabeling on events. 
- It introduces the concept of business groups and a permission system to manage various rules in a categorized manner.  
- Many databases and middleware come with built-in alert rules that can be directly imported and used. It also supports direct import of Prometheus alerting rules.  
- It supports alerting self-healing, which automatically triggers a script to execute predefined logic after an alarm is generated—such as cleaning up disk space or capturing the current system state.

![Nightingale Alarm Dashboard](doc/img/readme/2025-05-30_08-49-28.png)

- Nightingale archives historical alarms and supports multi-dimensional query and statistics.  
- It supports flexible aggregation grouping, allowing a clear view of the distribution of alarms across the company.

![Nightingale Integration Center](doc/img/readme/2025-05-23_18-46-06.png)

- Nightingale has built-in metric descriptions, dashboards, and alerting rules for common operating systems, middleware, and databases, which are contributed by the community with varying quality.  
- It directly receives data via multiple protocols such as Remote Write, OpenTSDB, Datadog, and Falcon, integrates with various Agents.  
- It supports data sources like Prometheus, ElasticSearch, Loki, ClickHouse, MySQL, Postgres, allowing alerting based on data from these sources.  
- Nightingale can be easily embedded into internal enterprise systems (e.g. Grafana, CMDB), and even supports configuring menu visibility for these embedded systems.

![Nightingale dashboards](doc/img/readme/2025-05-23_18-49-02.png)

- Nightingale supports dashboard functionality, including common chart types, and comes with pre-built dashboards. The image above is a screenshot of one of these dashboards.  
- If you are already accustomed to Grafana, it is recommended to continue using Grafana for visualization, as Grafana has deeper expertise in this area.  
- For machine-related monitoring data collected by Categraf, it is advisable to use Nightingale&#039;s built-in dashboards for viewing. This is because Categraf&#039;s metric naming follows Telegraf&#039;s convention, which differs from that of Node Exporter.  
- Due to Nightingale&#039;s concept of business groups (where machines can belong to different groups), there may be scenarios where you only want to view machines within the current business group on the dashboard. Thus, Nightingale&#039;s dashboards can be linked with business groups for interactive filtering.

## Installation

### Recommended

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/grype | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```
Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of grype is community-maintained and not distributed by the anchore team.

```bash
choco install grype -y
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap anchore/grype
brew install grype
```

### MacPorts

On macOS, Grype can additionally be installed from the [community-maintained port](https://ports.macports.org/port/grype/) via MacPorts:

```bash
sudo port install grype
```

**Note**: Currently, Grype is built only for macOS and Linux.

### From source

See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md#native-development) for instructions to build and run from source.

### GitHub Actions

If you&#039;re using GitHub Actions, you can use our [Grype-based action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/anchore-container-scan) to run vulnerability scans on your code or container images during your CI workflows.

## Verifying the artifacts

Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.

You need the following tool to verify signature:

- [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)

Verification steps are as follow:

1. Download the files you want, and the checksums.txt, checksums.txt.pem and checksums.txt.sig files from the [releases](https://github.com/anchore/grype/releases) page:

2. Verify the signature:

```shell
cosign verify-blob &lt;path to checksum.txt&gt; \
--certificate &lt;path to checksums.txt.pem&gt; \
--signature &lt;path to checksums.txt.sig&gt; \
--certificate-identity-regexp &#039;https://github\.com/anchore/grype/\.github/workflows/.+&#039; \
--certificate-oidc-issuer &quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot;
```

3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:

```shell
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt
```

## Getting started

[Install the binary](#installation), and make sure that `grype` is available in your path. To scan for vulnerabilities in an image:

```
grype &lt;image&gt;
```

The above command scans for vulnerabilities visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the vulnerability scan, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```
grype &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

To run grype from a Docker container so it can scan a running container, use the following command:

```yml
docker run --rm \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
--name Grype anchore/grype:latest \
$(ImageName):$(ImageTag)
```

Grype can scan a variety of sources beyond those found in Docker.

```
# scan a container image archive (from the result of `docker image save ...`, `podman save ...`, or `skopeo copy` commands)
grype path/to/image.tar

# scan a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container
grype path/to/image.sif

# scan a directory
grype dir:path/to/dir
```

Sources can be explicitly provided with a scheme:

```
podman:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Podman daemon
docker:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Docker daemon
docker-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar   use a tarball from disk for archives created from &quot;docker save&quot;
oci-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar      use a tarball from disk for OCI archives (from Skopeo or otherwise)
oci-dir:path/to/yourimage              read directly from a path on disk for OCI layout directories (from Skopeo or otherwise)
singularity:path/to/yourimage.sif      read directly from a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container on disk
dir:path/to/yourproject                read directly from a path on disk (any directory)
file:path/to/yourfile                  read directly from a file on disk
sbom:path/to/syft.json                 read Syft JSON from path on disk
registry:yourrepo/yourimage:tag        pull image directly from a registry (no container runtime required)
```

If an image source is not provided and cannot be detected from the given reference it is assumed the image should be pulled from the Docker daemon.
If docker is not present, then the Podman daemon is attempted next, followed by reaching out directly to the image registry last.


This default behavior can be overridden with the `default-image-pull-source` configuration option (See [Configuration](https://github.com/anchore/grype#configuration) for more details).

Use SBOMs for even faster vulnerability scanning in Grype:

```
# Then scan for new vulnerabilities as frequently as needed
grype sbom:./sbom.json

# (You can also pipe the SBOM into Grype)
cat ./sbom.json | grype
```

Grype supports input of [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)
SBOM formats. If Syft has generated any of these file types, they should have the appropriate information to work properly with Grype.
It is also possible to use SBOMs generated by other tools with varying degrees of success. Two things that make Grype matching
more successful are the inclusion of CPE and Linux distribution information. If an SBOM does not include any CPE information, it
is possible to generate these based on package information using the `--add-cpes-if-none` flag. To specify a distribution,
use the `--distro &lt;distro&gt;:&lt;version&gt;` flag. A full example is:

```
grype --add-cpes-if-none --distro alpine:3.10 sbom:some-alpine-3.10.spdx.json
```

## Threat &amp; Risk Prioritization

This section explains the columns and UI cues that help prioritize remediation efforts:

- **Severity**: String severity based on CVSS scores and indicate the significance of a vulnerability in levels.
  This balances concerns such as ease of exploitability, and the potential to affect 
  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of software and services.

- **EPSS**:
  [Exploit Prediction Scoring System](https://www.first.org/epss/model) is a metric expressing the likelihood
  that a vulnerability will be 
  exploited in the wild over the next 30 days (on a 0–1 scale); higher values signal a greater likelihood of 
  exploitation.
  The table output shows the EPSS percentile, a one-way transform of the EPSS score showing the 
  proportion of all scored vulnerabilities with an equal or lower probability.
  Percentiles linearize a heavily skewed distribution, making threshold choice (e.g. “only CVEs above the 
  90th percentile”) straightforward.

- **KEV Indicator**: Flags entries from CISA’s [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
  --an authoritative list of flaws observed being exploited in the wild.

- **Risk Score**: A composite 0–100 metric calculated as:
  ```markdown
  risk = min(1, threat * average(severity)) * 100
  ```
  Where: 
  - `severity` is the average of all CVSS scores and string severity for a vulnerability (scaled between 0–1).
  - `threat` is the EPSS score (between 0–1). If the vulnerability is on the KEV list then `threat` is 
    `1.05`, or `1.1` if the vulnerability is associated with a ransomware campaign.
  This metric is one way to combine EPSS and CVSS suggested in the [EPSS user guide](https://www.first.org/epss/user-guide).

- **Suggested Fixes**: All possible fixes for a package are listed, however, when multiple fixes are available, we de-emphasize all 
  upgrade paths except for the minimal upgrade path (which highlights the smallest, safest version bump).

Results default to sorting by Risk Score and can be overridden with `--sort-by &lt;value&gt;`:

- `severity`: sort by severity
- `epss`: sort by EPSS percentile (aka, &quot;threat&quot;)
- `risk`: sort by risk score
- `kev`: just like risk, except that KEV entries are always above non-KEV entries
- `package`: sort by package name, version, type
- `vulnerability`: sort by vulnerability ID

### Supported versions

Software updates are always applied to the latest version of Grype; fixes are not backported to any previous versions of Grype.

In terms of database updates, any version of Grype before v0.51.0 (Oct 2022, before schema v5) will not receive
vulnerability database updates. You can still build vulnerability databases for unsupported Grype releases by using previous
releases of [vunnel](https://github.com/anchore/vunnel) to gather the upstream data and [grype-db](https://github.com/anchore/grype-db)
to build databases for unsupported schemas.

Only the latest database schema is considered to be supported. When a new database schema is introduced then the one it replaces is
marked as deprecated. Deprecated schemas will continue to receive updates for at least one year after they are marked
as deprecated at which point they will no longer be supported.

### Working with attestations
Grype supports scanning SBOMs as input via stdin. Users can use [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to verify attestations
with an SBOM as its content to scan an image for vulnerabilities:
```
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-attestation caphill4/java-spdx-tools:latest \
| jq -r .payload \
| base64 --decode \
| jq -r .predicate.Data \
| grype
```

### Vulnerability Summary

#### Basic Grype Vulnerability Data Shape

```json
 {
  &quot;vulnerability&quot;: {
    ...
  },
  &quot;relatedVulnerabilities&quot;: [
    ...
  ],
  &quot;matchDetails&quot;: [
    ...
  ],
  &quot;artifact&quot;: {
    ...
  }
}
```

- **Vulnerability**: All information on the specific vulnerability that was directly matched on (e.g. ID, severity, CVSS score, fix information, links for more information)
- **RelatedVulnerabilities**: Information pertaining to vulnerabilities found to be related to the main reported vulnerability. Maybe the vulnerability we matched on was a GitHub Security Advisory, which has an upstream CVE (in the authoritative national vulnerability database). In these cases we list the upstream vulnerabilities here.
- **MatchDetails**: This section tries to explain what we searched for while looking for a match and exactly what details on the package and vulnerability that lead to a match.
- **Artifact**: This is a subset of the information that we know about the package (when compared to the [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) json output, we summarize the metadata section).
  This has information about where within the container image or directory we found the package, what kind of package it is, licensing info, pURLs, CPEs, etc.

### Excluding file paths

Grype can exclude files and paths from being scanned within a source by using glob expressions
with one or more `--exclude` parameters:

```
grype &lt;source&gt; --exclude &#039;./out/**/*.json&#039; --exclude /etc
```

**Note:** in the case of _image scanning_, since the entire filesystem is scanned it is
possible to use absolute paths like `/etc` or `/usr/**/*.txt` whereas _directory scans_
exclude files _relative to the specified directory_. For example: scanning `/usr/foo` with
`--exclude ./package.json` would exclude `/usr/foo/package.json` and `--exclude &#039;**/package.json&#039;`
would exclude all `package.json` files under `/usr/foo`. For _directory scans_,
it is required to begin path expressions with `./`, `*/`, or `**/`, all of which
will be resolved _relative to the specified scan directory_. Keep in mind, your shell
may attempt to expand wildcards, so put those parameters in single quotes, like:
`&#039;**/*.json&#039;`.

### External Sources

Grype can be configured to incorporate external data sources for added fidelity in vulnerability matching. This
feature is currently disabled by default. To enable this feature add the following to the grype config:

```yaml
external-sources:
  enable: true
  maven:
    search-upstream-by-sha1: true
    base-url: https://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select
    rate-limit: 300ms # Time between Maven API requests
```

You can also configure the base-url if you&#039;re using another registry as your maven endpoint.

The rate at which Maven API requests are made can be configured to match your environment&#039;s requirements. The default is 300ms between requests.

### Output formats

The output format for Grype is configurable as well:

```
grype &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the formats available are:

- `table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `cyclonedx`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `json`: Use this to get as much information out of Grype as possible!
- `sarif`: Use this option to get a [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) report (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](#using-templates) below.

### Using templates

Grype lets you define custom output formats, using [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). Here&#039;s how it works:

- Define your format as a Go template, and save this template as a file.

- Set the output format to &quot;template&quot; (`-o template`).

- Specify the path to the template file (`-t ./path/to/custom.template`).

- Grype&#039;s template processing uses the same data models as the `json` output format — so if you&#039;re wondering what data is available as you author a template, you can use the output from `grype &lt;image&gt; -o json` as a reference.

**Please note:** Templates can access information about the system they are running on, such as environment variables. You should never run untrusted templates.

There are several example templates in the [templates](https://github.com/anchore/grype/tree/main/templates) directory in the Grype source which can serve as a starting point for a custom output format. For example, [csv.tmpl](https://github.com/anchore/grype/blob/main/templates/csv.tmpl) produces a vulnerability report in CSV (comma separated value) format:

```text
&quot;Package&quot;,&quot;Version Installed&quot;,&quot;Vulnerability ID&quot;,&quot;Severity&quot;
&quot;coreutils&quot;,&quot;8.30-3ubuntu2&quot;,&quot;CVE-2016-2781&quot;,&quot;Low&quot;
&quot;libc-bin&quot;,&quot;2.31-0ubuntu9&quot;,&quot;CVE-2016-10228&quot;,&quot;Negligible&quot;
&quot;libc-bin&quot;,&quot;2.31-0ubuntu9&quot;,&quot;CVE-2020-6096&quot;,&quot;Low&quot;
...
```

You can also find the template for the default &quot;table&quot; output format in the same place.

Grype also includes a vast array of utility templating functions from [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) apart from the default golang [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Functions) to allow users to customize the output from Grype.

### Gating on severity of vulnerabilities

You can have Grype exit with an error if any vulnerabilities are reported at or above the specified severity level. This comes in handy when using Grype within a script or CI pipeline. To do this, use the `--fail-on &lt;severity&gt;` CLI flag.

For example, here&#039;s how you could trigger a CI pipeline failure if any vulnerabilities are found in the `ubuntu:latest` image with a severity of &quot;medium&quot; or higher:

```
grype ubuntu:latest --fail-on medium
```

**Note:** Grype returns exit code `2` on vulnerability errors.

### Specifying matches to ignore

If you&#039;re seeing Grype report **false positives** or any other vulnerability matches that you just don&#039;t want to see, you can tell Grype to **ignore** matches by specifying one or more _&quot;ignore rules&quot;_ in your Grype configuration file (e.g. `~/.grype.yaml`). This causes Grype not to report any vulnerability matches that meet the criteria specified by any of your ignore rules.

Each rule can specify any combination of the following criteria:

- vulnerability ID (e.g. `&quot;CVE-2008-4318&quot;`)
- namespace (e.g. `&quot;nvd&quot;`)
- fix state (allowed values: `&quot;fixed&quot;`, `&quot;not-fixed&quot;`, `&quot;wont-fix&quot;`, or `&quot;unknown&quot;`)
- package name (e.g. `&quot;libcurl&quot;`)
- package version (e.g

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9450/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9450)

`oapi-codegen` is a command-line tool and library to convert OpenAPI specifications to Go code, be it [server-side implementations](#generating-server-side-boilerplate), [API clients](#generating-api-clients), or simply [HTTP models](#generating-api-models).

Using `oapi-codegen` allows you to reduce the boilerplate required to create or integrate with services based on [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md), and instead focus on writing your business logic, and working on the real value-add for your organisation.

With `oapi-codegen`, there are a few [Key Design Decisions](#key-design-decisions) we&#039;ve made, including:

- idiomatic Go, where possible
- fairly simple generated code, erring on the side of duplicate code over nicely refactored code
- supporting as much of OpenAPI 3.x as is possible, alongside Go&#039;s type system

`oapi-codegen` is one part of a wider ecosystem, which can be found described in further detail in the [oapi-codegen organisation on GitHub](https://github.com/oapi-codegen).

⚠️ This README may be for the latest development version, which may contain unreleased changes. Please ensure you&#039;re looking at the README for the latest release version.

## Action Required: The repository for this project has changed

As announced in [May 2024](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/discussions/1605),
we have moved the project from the deepmap organization to our own organization, and you will need to update your
import paths to pull updates past this point. You need to do a recursive search/replace from
`github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/v2` to `github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2`.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; `oapi-codegen` moved to its new home with the version tag `v2.3.0`.

If you are using `v2.2.0` or below, please install like so:

```sh
# for the binary install
go install github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen@v2.2.0
```

If you are using `v2.3.0` or above, please install like so, using the new module import path:

```sh
# for the binary install
go install github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest
```

## Install

## For Go 1.24+

It is recommended to follow [the `go tool` support available from Go 1.24+](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2025/01/27/go-tools-124/) for managing the dependency of `oapi-codegen` alongside your core application.

To do this, you run `go get -tool`:

```sh
$ go get -tool github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest
# this will then modify your `go.mod`
```

From there, each invocation of `oapi-codegen` would be used like so:

```go
//go:generate go tool oapi-codegen -config cfg.yaml ../../api.yaml
```

## Prior to Go 1.24

It is recommended to follow [the `tools.go` pattern](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/06/15/go-tools-dependency-management/) for managing the dependency of `oapi-codegen` alongside your core application.

This would give you a `tools/tools.go`:

```go
//go:build tools
// +build tools

package main

import (
	_ &quot;github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen&quot;
)
```

Then, each invocation of `oapi-codegen` would be used like so:

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen --config=config.yaml ../../api.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can install it as a binary with:

```sh
$ go install github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest
$ oapi-codegen -version
```

Which then means you can invoke it like so:

```go
//go:generate oapi-codegen --config=config.yaml ../../api.yaml
```

Note that you can also [move your `tools.go` into its own sub-module](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2024/09/30/go-tools-module/) to reduce the impact on your top-level `go.mod`.

### Pinning to commits

While the project does not ([yet](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/issues/1519)) have a defined release cadence, there may be cases where you want to pull in yet-unreleased changes to your codebase.

Therefore, you may want to pin your dependency on `oapi-codegen` to a given commit hash, rather than a tag.

This is **officially recommended** for consumers of `oapi-codegen`, who want features/bug fixes that haven&#039;t yet been released.

We aim to keep the default branch ready-to-release so you should be able to safely pin.

To do so, you can run:

```sh
# pin to the latest version on the default branch
$ go get github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2@main
# alternatively, to a commit hash i.e. https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/commit/71e916c59688a6379b5774dfe5904ec222b9a537
$ go get github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2@71e916c59688a6379b5774dfe5904ec222b9a537
```

This will then make a change such as:

```diff
diff --git go.mod go.mod
index 44f29a4..436a780 100644
--- go.mod
+++ go.mod
@@ -2,21 +2,20 @@
-require github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2 v2.1.0
+require github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2 v2.1.1-0.20240331212514-80f0b978ef16
```

## Usage

`oapi-codegen` is largely configured using a YAML configuration file, to simplify the number of flags that users need to remember, and to make reading the `go:generate` command less daunting.

For full details of what is supported, it&#039;s worth checking out [the GoDoc for `codegen.Configuration`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/pkg/codegen#Configuration).

We also have [a JSON Schema](configuration-schema.json) that can be used by IDEs/editors with the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to perform intelligent suggestions, i.e.:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/HEAD/configuration-schema.json
package: api
# ...
```

### Backwards compatibility

Although we strive to retain backwards compatibility - as a project that&#039;s using a stable API per SemVer - there are sometimes opportunities we must take to fix a bug that could cause a breaking change for [people relying upon the behaviour](https://xkcd.com/1172/).

In this case, we will expose a [compatibility option](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/pkg/codegen#CompatibilityOptions) to restore old behaviour.

## Features

At a high level, `oapi-codegen` supports:

- Generating server-side boilerplate for [a number of servers](#supported-servers) ([docs](#generating-server-side-boilerplate))
- Generating client API boilerplate ([docs](#generating-api-clients))
- Generating the types ([docs](#generating-api-models))
- Splitting large OpenAPI specs across multiple packages([docs](#import-mapping))
  - This is also known as &quot;Import Mapping&quot; or &quot;external references&quot; across our documentation / discussion in GitHub issues

## What does it look like?

Below we can see a trimmed down example taken from the OpenAPI Petstore [example](examples/petstore-expanded/stdhttp/api/petstore.gen.go):

```go
// generated code

type ServerInterface interface {
	// ...
	// Returns all pets
	// (GET /pets)
	FindPets(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, params FindPetsParams)
	// ...
}

// FindPets operation middleware
func (siw *ServerInterfaceWrapper) FindPets(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

	var err error

	// Parameter object where we will unmarshal all parameters from the context
	var params FindPetsParams

	// ------------- Optional query parameter &quot;tags&quot; -------------

	err = runtime.BindQueryParameter(&quot;form&quot;, true, false, &quot;tags&quot;, r.URL.Query(), &amp;params.Tags)
	if err != nil {
		siw.ErrorHandlerFunc(w, r, &amp;InvalidParamFormatError{ParamName: &quot;tags&quot;, Err: err})
		return
	}

	// ------------- Optional query parameter &quot;limit&quot; -------------

	err = runtime.BindQueryParameter(&quot;form&quot;, true, false, &quot;limit&quot;, r.URL.Query(), &amp;params.Limit)
	if err != nil {
		siw.ErrorHandlerFunc(w, r, &amp;InvalidParamFormatError{ParamName: &quot;limit&quot;, Err: err})
		return
	}

	handler := http.Handler(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		siw.Handler.FindPets(w, r, params)
	}))

	for _, middleware := range siw.HandlerMiddlewares {
		handler = middleware(handler)
	}

	handler.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}

// HandlerWithOptions creates http.Handler with additional options
func HandlerWithOptions(si ServerInterface, options StdHTTPServerOptions) http.Handler {
	m := options.BaseRouter

	if m == nil {
		m = http.NewServeMux()
	}
	if options.ErrorHandlerFunc == nil {
		options.ErrorHandlerFunc = func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, err error) {
			http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
		}
	}

	wrapper := ServerInterfaceWrapper{
		Handler:            si,
		HandlerMiddlewares: options.Middlewares,
		ErrorHandlerFunc:   options.ErrorHandlerFunc,
	}

	m.HandleFunc(&quot;GET &quot;+options.BaseURL+&quot;/pets&quot;, wrapper.FindPets)

	return m
}
```

Then, in your own code, you implement the underlying logic for the `FindPets` implementation:

```go
type PetStore struct {
	Pets   map[int64]Pet
	NextId int64
	Lock   sync.Mutex
}

// Make sure we conform to ServerInterface

var _ ServerInterface = (*PetStore)(nil)

func NewPetStore() *PetStore {
	return &amp;PetStore{
		Pets:   make(map[int64]Pet),
		NextId: 1000,
	}
}

// FindPets implements all the handlers in the ServerInterface
func (p *PetStore) FindPets(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, params FindPetsParams) {
	p.Lock.Lock()
	defer p.Lock.Unlock()

	var result []Pet

	for _, pet := range p.Pets {
		if params.Tags != nil {
			// If we have tags,  filter pets by tag
			for _, t := range *params.Tags {
				if pet.Tag != nil &amp;&amp; (*pet.Tag == t) {
					result = append(result, pet)
				}
			}
		} else {
			// Add all pets if we&#039;re not filtering
			result = append(result, pet)
		}

		if params.Limit != nil {
			l := int(*params.Limit)
			if len(result) &gt;= l {
				// We&#039;re at the limit
				break
			}
		}
	}

	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	_ = json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(result)
}
```

As we can see, `oapi-codegen` simplifies some of the boilerplate by taking parameters out of the request and instead allows us to focus on the implementation.

You&#039;ll note that there&#039;s still a bit more marshaling of request/response data, which is further reduced by using the [Strict server](#strict-server) functionality.

&lt;a name=&quot;what-does-it-look-like-strict&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
When using the strict server, you&#039;ll have the following generated code:

```go
// StrictServerInterface represents all server handlers.
type StrictServerInterface interface {
	// ...
	// Returns all pets
	// (GET /pets)
	FindPets(ctx context.Context, request FindPetsRequestObject) (FindPetsResponseObject, error)
	// ...
}

func NewStrictHandlerWithOptions(ssi StrictServerInterface, middlewares []StrictMiddlewareFunc, options StrictHTTPServerOptions) ServerInterface {
	return &amp;strictHandler{ssi: ssi, middlewares: middlewares, options: options}
}

// FindPets operation middleware
func (sh *strictHandler) FindPets(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, params FindPetsParams) {
	var request FindPetsRequestObject

	request.Params = params

	handler := func(ctx context.Context, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, request interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
		return sh.ssi.FindPets(ctx, request.(FindPetsRequestObject))
	}
	for _, middleware := range sh.middlewares {
		handler = middleware(handler, &quot;FindPets&quot;)
	}

	response, err := handler(r.Context(), w, r, request)

	if err != nil {
		sh.options.ResponseErrorHandlerFunc(w, r, err)
	} else if validResponse, ok := response.(FindPetsResponseObject); ok {
		if err := validResponse.VisitFindPetsResponse(w); err != nil {
			sh.options.ResponseErrorHandlerFunc(w, r, err)
		}
	} else if response != nil {
		sh.options.ResponseErrorHandlerFunc(w, r, fmt.Errorf(&quot;unexpected response type: %T&quot;, response))
	}
}
```

Then, in your own code, you implement the underlying logic for the `FindPets` implementation:

```go
// Make sure we conform to StrictServerInterface

var _ StrictServerInterface = (*PetStore)(nil)

func NewPetStore() *PetStore {
	return &amp;PetStore{
		Pets:   make(map[int64]Pet),
		NextId: 1000,
	}
}

// FindPets implements all the handlers in the ServerInterface
func (p *PetStore) FindPets(ctx context.Context, request FindPetsRequestObject) (FindPetsResponseObject, error) {
	p.Lock.Lock()
	defer p.Lock.Unlock()

	var result []Pet

	for _, pet := range p.Pets {
		if request.Params.Tags != nil {
			// If we have tags,  filter pets by tag
			for _, t := range *request.Params.Tags {
				if pet.Tag != nil &amp;&amp; (*pet.Tag == t) {
					result = append(result, pet)
				}
			}
		} else {
			// Add all pets if we&#039;re not filtering
			result = append(result, pet)
		}

		if request.Params.Limit != nil {
			l := int(*request.Params.Limit)
			if len(result) &gt;= l {
				// We&#039;re at the limit
				break
			}
		}
	}

	return FindPets200JSONResponse(result), nil
}
```

We can see that this provides the best means to focus on the implementation of the business logic within the endpoint, rather than (un)marshalling types to and from JSON, or wrangling cookies or headers.

## Key design decisions

- Produce an interface that can be satisfied by your implementation, with reduced boilerplate
- Bulk processing and parsing of OpenAPI document in Go
- Resulting output is using Go&#039;s `text/template`s, which are user-overridable
- Attempts to produce Idiomatic Go
- Single-file output
- Support multiple OpenAPI files by having a package-per-OpenAPI file
- Support of OpenAPI 3.0
  - OpenAPI 3.1 support is [awaiting upstream support](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/issues/373)
  - Note that this does not include OpenAPI 2.0 (aka Swagger)
- Extract parameters from requests, to reduce work required by your implementation
- Implicit `additionalProperties` are ignored by default ([more details](#additional-properties-additionalproperties))
- Prune unused types by default

## Generating server-side boilerplate

`oapi-codegen` shines by making it fairly straightforward (note that this is a purposeful choice of wording here - we want to avoid words like &quot;easy&quot;) to generate the server-side boilerplate for a backend API.

Below you can find the supported servers, and more information about how to implement a server using them.

To provide you a fully Test Driven Development style test harness to confirm you are following the specification, you could use a tool such as [openapi.tanna.dev/go/validator](https://openapi.tanna.dev/go/validator/), or craft your own.

### Supported Servers

Right now, we support the following servers, and are supportive of adding new servers, too!

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
Server
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;code&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; flag to enable code generation
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
Example usage
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

[Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;chi-server&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;


For a Chi server, you will want a configuration file such as:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: ...
package: api
generate:
  chi-server: true
  models: true
output: gen.go
```

To implement this, check out [the Chi docs](#impl-chi).

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

[Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo)

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;echo-server&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

For an Echo server, you will want a configuration file such as:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: ...
package: api
generate:
  echo-server: true
  models: true
output: gen.go
```

To implement this, check out [the Echo docs](#impl-echo).

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

[Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;fiber-server&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

For a Fiber server, you will want a configuration file such as:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: ...
package: api
generate:
  fiber-server: true
  models: true
output: gen.go
```

To implement this, check out [the Fiber docs](#impl-fiber).

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

[Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;gin-server&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

For a Gin server, you will want a configuration file such as:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: ...
package: api
generate:
  gin-server: true
  models: true
output: gen.go
```

To implement this, check out [the Gin docs](#impl-gin).

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

[gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;gorilla-server&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

For a gorilla/mux server, you will want a configuration file such as:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: ...
package: api
generate:
  gorilla-server: true
  models: true
output: gen.go
```

To implement this, check out [the gorilla/mux docs](#impl-gorillamux).

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

[Iris](https://github.com/kataras/iris)

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;iris-server&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

For a Iris server, you will want a configuration file such as:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: ...
package: api
generate:
  iris-server: true
  models: true
output: gen.go
```

To implement this, check out [the Iris docs](#impl-iris).

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

[1.22+ `net/http`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;std-http-server&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

To use purely `net/http` (for Go 1.22+), you will want a configuration file such as:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: ...
package: api
generate:
  std-http-server: true
  models: true
output: gen.go
```

To implement this, check out [the Go 1.22+ `net/http` docs](#impl-stdhttp).

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

### Go 1.22+ `net/http`
&lt;a name=&quot;impl-stdhttp&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

As of Go 1.22, enhancements have been made to the routing of the `net/http` package in the standard library, which makes it a great starting point for implementing a server with, before needing to reach for another router or a full framework.

For instance, let&#039;s take this straightforward specification:

```yaml
openapi: &quot;3.0.0&quot;
info:
  version: 1.0.0
  title: Minimal ping API server

  /ping:
    get:

                $ref: &#039;#/components/schemas/Pong&#039;
components:
  schemas:
    # base types
    Pong:
      type: object
      required:
        - ping
      properties:
        ping:
          type: string
          example: pong
```

This then generates code such as:

```go
// Pong defines model for Pong.
type Pong struct {
	Ping string `json:&quot;ping&quot;`
}

// ServerInterface represents all server handlers.
type ServerInterface interface {

	// (GET /ping)
	GetPing(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
}

func HandlerFromMux(si ServerInterface, m ServeMux) http.Handler {
	return HandlerWithOptions(si, StdHTTPServerOptions{
		BaseRouter: m,
	})
}

// HandlerWithOptions creates http.Handler with additional options
func HandlerWithOptions(si ServerInterface, options StdHTTPServerOptions) http.Handler {
	m := options.BaseRouter

	// ... omitted for brevity

	m.HandleFunc(&quot;GET &quot;+options.BaseURL+&quot;/ping&quot;, wrapper.GetPing)

	return m
}
```

To implement this HTTP server, we need to write the following code in our [`api/impl.go`](examples/minimal-server/stdhttp/api/impl.go):

```go
import (
	&quot;encoding/json&quot;
	&quot;net/http&quot;
)

// optional code omitted

type Server struct{}

func NewServer() Server {
	return Server{}
}

// (GET /ping)
func (Server) GetPing(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	resp := Pong{
		Ping: &quot;pong&quot;,
	}

	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	_ = json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(resp)
}
```

Now we&#039;ve got our implementation, we can then write the following code to wire it up and get a running server:

```go
import (
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;net/http&quot;

	&quot;github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/examples/minimal-server/stdhttp/api&quot;
)

func main() {
	// create a type that satisfies the `api.ServerInterface`, which contains an implementation of every operation from the generated code
	server := api.NewServer()

	r := http.NewServeMux()

	// get an `http.Handler` that we can use
	h := api.HandlerFromMux(server, r)

	s := &amp;http.Server{
		Handler: h,
		Addr:    &quot;0.0.0.0:8080&quot;,
	}

	// And we serve HTTP until the world ends.
	log.Fatal(s.ListenAndServe())
}
```
