```bash
# Method 1: Using Make commands (Recommended)
make dev-start      # Start infrastructure
make dev-app        # Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend (new terminal)

# Method 2: One-click start
./scripts/quick-dev.sh

# Method 3: Using scripts
./scripts/dev.sh start     # Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev.sh app       # Start backend (new terminal)
./scripts/dev.sh frontend  # Start frontend (new terminal)
```

**Development Advantages:**

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

## Introduction

Syft is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for container images and filesystems. It provides detailed visibility into the packages and dependencies in your software, helping you manage vulnerabilities, license compliance, and software supply chain security.

Syft development is sponsored by [Anchore](https://anchore.com/), and is released under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file). For commercial support options with Syft or Grype, please [contact Anchore](https://get.anchore.com/contact/).

## Features
- Generates SBOMs for container images, filesystems, archives, and more to discover packages and libraries
- Supports OCI, Docker and [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) image formats
- Linux distribution identification
- Works seamlessly with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) (a fast, modern vulnerability scanner)
- Able to create signed SBOM attestations using the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md)
- Convert between SBOM formats, such as CycloneDX, SPDX, and Syft&#039;s own format.

## Installation

Syft binaries are provided for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Recommended
&gt; ```bash
&gt; curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/syft | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
&gt; ```

Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Homebrew
```bash
brew install syft
```

### Scoop

```powershell
scoop install syft
```

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of Syft is community-maintained and not distributed by the Anchore team

```powershell
choco install syft -y
```

### Nix

**Note**: Nix packaging of Syft is [community maintained](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/sy/syft/package.nix). Syft is available in the [stable channel](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_channels#The_official_channels) since NixOS `22.05`.

```bash
nix-env -i syft
```

... or, just try it out in an ephemeral nix shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p syft
```

## Getting started

### SBOM

To generate an SBOM for a container image:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt;
```

The above output includes only software that is visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the SBOM, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

### Output formats

The output format for Syft is configurable as well using the `-o` (or `--output`) option:

```
syft &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the `formats` available are:
- `syft-json`: Use this to get as much information out of Syft as possible!
- `syft-text`: A row-oriented, human-and-machine-friendly output.
- `cyclonedx-xml`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-xml@1.5`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json@1.5`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `spdx-tag-value`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/).
- `spdx-tag-value@2.2`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.2.2/).
- `spdx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.3/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `spdx-json@2.2`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.2/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `github-json`: A JSON report conforming to GitHub&#039;s dependency snapshot format.
- `syft-table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](https://github.com/anchore/syft/wiki/using-templates) below.

Note that flags using the @&lt;version&gt; can be used for earlier versions of each specification as well.

# Technical Introduction

Portmaster is a privacy suite for your Windows and Linux desktop.

### Base Technology

- Portmaster integrates into network stack using nfqueue on Linux and a kernel driver (WFP) on Windows.
- Packets are intercepted at the raw packet level - every packet is seen and can be stopped.
- Ownership of connections is found using eBPF and `/proc` on Linux and a kernel driver and the IP Helper API (`iphlpapi.dll`) on Windows.
- Most settings can be defined per app, which can be matched in different ways.
- Support for special processes with weird or concealed paths/actors:
  - Snap, AppImage and Script support on Linux
  - Windows Store apps and svchost.exe system services support on Windows
- Everything is 100% local on your device. (except the SPN, naturally)
  - Updates are fully signed and downloaded automatically.
  - Intelligence data (block lists, geoip) is downloaded and applied automatically.
- The Portmaster Core Service runs as a system service, the UI elements (App, Notifier) run in user context.
- The main UI still uses electron as a wrapper :/ - but this will change in the future. You can also open the UI in the browser

### Feature: Secure DNS

- Portmaster intercepts &quot;astray&quot; DNS queries and reroutes them to itself for seamless integration.
- DNS queries are resolved by the default or configured DoT/DoH resolvers.
- Full support for split horizon and horizon validation to defend against rebinding attacks.

### Feature: Privacy Filter

- Define allowed network scopes: Localhost, LAN, Internet, P2P, Inbound.
- Easy rules based on Internet entities: Domain, IP, Country and more.
- Filter Lists block common malware, ad, tracker domains etc.

### Feature: Network History ($)

- Record connections and their details in a local database and search all of it later
- Auto-delete old history or delete on demand

### Feature: Bandwidth Visibility ($)

- Monitor bandwidth usage per connection and app

### Feature: SPN - Safing Privacy Network ($$)

- A Privacy Network aimed at use cases &quot;between&quot; VPN and Tor.
- Uses onion encryption over multiple hops just like Tor.
- Routes are chosen to cover most distance within the network to increase privacy.
- Exits are chosen near the destination server. This automatically geo-unblocks in many cases.
- Exclude apps and domains/entities from using SPN.
- Change routing algorithm and focus per app.
- Nodes are hosted by Safing (company behind Portmaster) and the community.
- Speeds are pretty decent (&gt;100MBit/s).
- Further Reading: [SPN Whitepaper](https://safing.io/files/whitepaper/Gate17.pdf)

[![GoDoc Widget]][GoDoc]

`chi` is a lightweight, idiomatic and composable router for building Go HTTP services. It&#039;s
especially good at helping you write large REST API services that are kept maintainable as your
project grows and changes. `chi` is built on the new `context` package introduced in Go 1.7 to
handle signaling, cancelation and request-scoped values across a handler chain.

The focus of the project has been to seek out an elegant and comfortable design for writing
REST API servers, written during the development of the Pressly API service that powers our
public API service, which in turn powers all of our client-side applications.

The key considerations of chi&#039;s design are: project structure, maintainability, standard http
handlers (stdlib-only), developer productivity, and deconstructing a large system into many small
parts. The core router `github.com/go-chi/chi` is quite small (less than 1000 LOC), but we&#039;ve also
included some useful/optional subpackages: [middleware](/middleware), [render](https://github.com/go-chi/render)
and [docgen](https://github.com/go-chi/docgen). We hope you enjoy it too!

## Install

```sh
go get -u github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
```


## Features

* **Lightweight** - cloc&#039;d in ~1000 LOC for the chi router
* **Fast** - yes, see [benchmarks](#benchmarks)
* **100% compatible with net/http** - use any http or middleware pkg in the ecosystem that is also compatible with `net/http`
* **Designed for modular/composable APIs** - middlewares, inline middlewares, route groups and sub-router mounting
* **Context control** - built on new `context` package, providing value chaining, cancellations and timeouts
* **Robust** - in production at Pressly, Cloudflare, Heroku, 99Designs, and many others (see [discussion](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/issues/91))
* **Doc generation** - `docgen` auto-generates routing documentation from your source to JSON or Markdown
* **Go.mod support** - as of v5, go.mod support (see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))
* **No external dependencies** - plain ol&#039; Go stdlib + net/http


## Examples

See [_examples/](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/_examples/) for a variety of examples.


**As easy as:**

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;net/http&quot;

	&quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5&quot;
	&quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware&quot;
)

func main() {
	r := chi.NewRouter()
	r.Use(middleware.Logger)
	r.Get(&quot;/&quot;, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Write([]byte(&quot;welcome&quot;))
	})
	http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:3000&quot;, r)
}
```

**REST Preview:**

Here is a little preview of what routing looks like with chi. Also take a look at the generated routing docs
in JSON ([routes.json](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/_examples/rest/routes.json)) and in
Markdown ([routes.md](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/_examples/rest/routes.md)).

I highly recommend reading the source of the [examples](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/_examples/) listed
above, they will show you all the features of chi and serve as a good form of documentation.

```go
import (
  //...
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5&quot;
  &quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware&quot;
)

func main() {
  r := chi.NewRouter()

  // A good base middleware stack
  r.Use(middleware.RequestID)
  r.Use(middleware.RealIP)
  r.Use(middleware.Logger)
  r.Use(middleware.Recoverer)

  // Set a timeout value on the request context (ctx), that will signal
  // through ctx.Done() that the request has timed out and further
  // processing should be stopped.
  r.Use(middleware.Timeout(60 * time.Second))

  r.Get(&quot;/&quot;, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte(&quot;hi&quot;))
  })

  // RESTy routes for &quot;articles&quot; resource
  r.Route(&quot;/articles&quot;, func(r chi.Router) {
    r.With(paginate).Get(&quot;/&quot;, listArticles)                           // GET /articles
    r.With(paginate).Get(&quot;/{month}-{day}-{year}&quot;, listArticlesByDate) // GET /articles/01-16-2017

    r.Post(&quot;/&quot;, createArticle)                                        // POST /articles
    r.Get(&quot;/search&quot;, searchArticles)                                  // GET /articles/search

    // Regexp url parameters:
    r.Get(&quot;/{articleSlug:[a-z-]+}&quot;, getArticleBySlug)                // GET /articles/home-is-toronto

    // Subrouters:
    r.Route(&quot;/{articleID}&quot;, func(r chi.Router) {
      r.Use(ArticleCtx)
      r.Get(&quot;/&quot;, getArticle)                                          // GET /articles/123
      r.Put(&quot;/&quot;, updateArticle)                                       // PUT /articles/123
      r.Delete(&quot;/&quot;, deleteArticle)                                    // DELETE /articles/123
    })
  })

  // Mount the admin sub-router
  r.Mount(&quot;/admin&quot;, adminRouter())

  http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:3333&quot;, r)
}

func ArticleCtx(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    articleID := chi.URLParam(r, &quot;articleID&quot;)
    article, err := dbGetArticle(articleID)
    if err != nil {
      http.Error(w, http.StatusText(404), 404)
      return
    }
    ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), &quot;article&quot;, article)
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
  })
}

func getArticle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  ctx := r.Context()
  article, ok := ctx.Value(&quot;article&quot;).(*Article)
  if !ok {
    http.Error(w, http.StatusText(422), 422)
    return
  }
  w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;title:%s&quot;, article.Title)))
}

// A completely separate router for administrator routes
func adminRouter() http.Handler {
  r := chi.NewRouter()
  r.Use(AdminOnly)
  r.Get(&quot;/&quot;, adminIndex)
  r.Get(&quot;/accounts&quot;, adminListAccounts)
  return r
}

func AdminOnly(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    ctx := r.Context()
    perm, ok := ctx.Value(&quot;acl.permission&quot;).(YourPermissionType)
    if !ok || !perm.IsAdmin() {
      http.Error(w, http.StatusText(403), 403)
      return
    }
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
  })
}
```


## Router interface

chi&#039;s router is based on a kind of [Patricia Radix trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree).
The router is fully compatible with `net/http`.

Built on top of the tree is the `Router` interface:

```go
// Router consisting of the core routing methods used by chi&#039;s Mux,
// using only the standard net/http.
type Router interface {
	http.Handler
	Routes

	// Use appends one or more middlewares onto the Router stack.
	Use(middlewares ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler)

	// With adds inline middlewares for an endpoint handler.
	With(middlewares ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler) Router

	// Group adds a new inline-Router along the current routing
	// path, with a fresh middleware stack for the inline-Router.
	Group(fn func(r Router)) Router

	// Route mounts a sub-Router along a `pattern` string.
	Route(pattern string, fn func(r Router)) Router

	// Mount attaches another http.Handler along ./pattern/*
	Mount(pattern string, h http.Handler)

	// Handle and HandleFunc adds routes for `pattern` that matches
	// all HTTP methods.
	Handle(pattern string, h http.Handler)
	HandleFunc(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// Method and MethodFunc adds routes for `pattern` that matches
	// the `method` HTTP method.
	Method(method, pattern string, h http.Handler)
	MethodFunc(method, pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// HTTP-method routing along `pattern`
	Connect(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Delete(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Get(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Head(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Options(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Patch(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Post(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Put(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Trace(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// NotFound defines a handler to respond whenever a route could
	// not be found.
	NotFound(h http.HandlerFunc)

	// MethodNotAllowed defines a handler to respond whenever a method is
	// not allowed.
	MethodNotAllowed(h http.HandlerFunc)
}

// Routes interface adds two methods for router traversal, which is also
// used by the github.com/go-chi/docgen package to generate documentation for Routers.
type Routes interface {
	// Routes returns the routing tree in an easily traversable structure.
	Routes() []Route

	// Middlewares returns the list of middlewares in use by the router.
	Middlewares() Middlewares

	// Match searches the routing tree for a handler that matches
	// the method/path - similar to routing a http request, but without
	// executing the handler thereafter.
	Match(rctx *Context, method, path string) bool
}
```

Each routing method accepts a URL `pattern` and chain of `handlers`. The URL pattern
supports named params (ie. `/users/{userID}`) and wildcards (ie. `/admin/*`). URL parameters
can be fetched at runtime by calling `chi.URLParam(r, &quot;userID&quot;)` for named parameters
and `chi.URLParam(r, &quot;*&quot;)` for a wildcard parameter.


### Middleware handlers

chi&#039;s middlewares are just stdlib net/http middleware handlers. There is nothing special
about them, which means the router and all the tooling is designed to be compatible and
friendly with any middleware in the community. This offers much better extensibility and reuse
of packages and is at the heart of chi&#039;s purpose.

Here is an example of a standard net/http middleware where we assign a context key `&quot;user&quot;`
the value of `&quot;123&quot;`. This middleware sets a hypothetical user identifier on the request
context and calls the next handler in the chain.

```go
// HTTP middleware setting a value on the request context
func MyMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // create new context from `r` request context, and assign key `&quot;user&quot;`
    // to value of `&quot;123&quot;`
    ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), &quot;user&quot;, &quot;123&quot;)

    // call the next handler in the chain, passing the response writer and
    // the updated request object with the new context value.
    //
    // note: context.Context values are nested, so any previously set
    // values will be accessible as well, and the new `&quot;user&quot;` key
    // will be accessible from this point forward.
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
  })
}
```


### Request handlers

chi uses standard net/http request handlers. This little snippet is an example of a http.Handler
func that reads a user identifier from the request context - hypothetically, identifying
the user sending an authenticated request, validated+set by a previous middleware handler.

```go
// HTTP handler accessing data from the request context.
func MyRequestHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // here we read from the request context and fetch out `&quot;user&quot;` key set in
  // the MyMiddleware example above.
  user := r.Context().Value(&quot;user&quot;).(string)

  // respond to the client
  w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;hi %s&quot;, user)))
}
```


### URL parameters

chi&#039;s router parses and stores URL parameters right onto the request context. Here is
an example of how to access URL params in your net/http handlers. And of course, middlewares
are able to access the same information.

```go
// HTTP handler accessing the url routing parameters.
func MyRequestHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // fetch the url parameter `&quot;userID&quot;` from the request of a matching
  // routing pattern. An example routing pattern could be: /users/{userID}
  userID := chi.URLParam(r, &quot;userID&quot;)

  // fetch `&quot;key&quot;` from the request context
  ctx := r.Context()
  key := ctx.Value(&quot;key&quot;).(string)

  // respond to the client
  w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;hi %v, %v&quot;, userID, key)))
}
```


## Middlewares

chi comes equipped with an optional `middleware` package, providing a suite of standard
`net/http` middlewares. Please note, any middleware in the ecosystem that is also compatible
with `net/http` can be used with chi&#039;s mux.

## context?

`context` is a tiny pkg that provides simple interface to signal context across call stacks
and goroutines. It was originally written by [Sameer Ajmani](https://github.com/Sajmani)
and is available in stdlib since go1.7.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TinyGo - Go compiler for small places

[![Linux](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/linux.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/linux.yml) [![macOS](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/build-macos.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/build-macos.yml) [![Windows](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/windows.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/windows.yml) [![Docker](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/docker.yml) [![Nix](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/nix.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/nix.yml) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/tinygo-org/tinygo/tree/dev.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/tinygo-org/tinygo/tree/dev)

TinyGo is a Go compiler intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (wasm/wasi), and command-line tools.

It reuses libraries used by the [Go language tools](https://golang.org/pkg/go/) alongside [LLVM](http://llvm.org) to provide an alternative way to compile programs written in the Go programming language.

## Embedded

Here is an example program that blinks the built-in LED when run directly on any supported board with onboard LED:

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;machine&quot;
    &quot;time&quot;
)

func main() {
    led := machine.LED
    led.Configure(machine.PinConfig{Mode: machine.PinOutput})
    for {
        led.Low()
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)

        led.High()
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)
    }
}
```

The above program can be compiled and run without modification on an Arduino Uno, an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or any of the supported boards that have a built-in LED, just by setting the correct TinyGo compiler target. For example, this compiles and flashes an Arduino Uno:

```shell
tinygo flash -target arduino examples/blinky1
```

## WebAssembly

TinyGo is very useful for compiling programs both for use in browsers (WASM) as well as for use on servers and other edge devices (WASI).

TinyGo programs can run in [Fastly Compute](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/guides/compute/go/), [Fermyon Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/go-components), [wazero](https://wazero.io/languages/tinygo/) and many other WebAssembly runtimes.

Here is a small TinyGo program for use by a WASI host application:

```go
package main

//go:wasmexport add
func add(x, y uint32) uint32 {
	return x + y
}
```

This compiles the above TinyGo program for use on any WASI Preview 1 runtime:

```shell
tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared -o add.wasm -target=wasip1 add.go
```

You can also use the same syntax as Go 1.24+:

```shell
GOARCH=wasip1 GOOS=wasm tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared -o add.wasm add.go
```

## Project Scope

Goals:

* Have very small binary sizes. Don&#039;t pay for what you don&#039;t use.
* Support for most common microcontroller boards.
* Be usable on the web using WebAssembly.
* Good CGo support, with no more overhead than a regular function call.
* Support most standard library packages and compile most Go code without modification.

Non-goals:

* Be efficient while using zillions of goroutines. However, good goroutine support is certainly a goal.
* Be as fast as `gc`. However, LLVM will probably be better at optimizing certain things so TinyGo might actually turn out to be faster for number crunching.
* Be able to compile every Go program out there.

## Why this project exists

&gt; We never expected Go to be an embedded language and so its got serious problems...

-- Rob Pike, [GopherCon 2014 Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoS7DsT1rdM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2799)

TinyGo is a project to bring Go to microcontrollers and small systems with a single processor core. It is similar to [emgo](https://github.com/ziutek/emgo) but a major difference is that we want to keep the Go memory model (which implies garbage collection of some sort). Another difference is that TinyGo uses LLVM internally instead of emitting C, which hopefully leads to smaller and more efficient code and certainly leads to more flexibility.

The original reasoning was: if [Python](https://micropython.org/) can run on microcontrollers, then certainly [Go](https://golang.org/) should be able to run on even lower level micros.

## What is frp?

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone&#039;s needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh1&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-a.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh2&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-b.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-a.example.com`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-b.example.com`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhostHTTPSPort`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;web&quot;
  type = &quot;http&quot;
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = [&quot;www.example.com&quot;]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;dns&quot;
  type = &quot;udp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  unixPath = &quot;/var/run/docker.sock&quot;
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_static_file&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;static_file&quot;
  localPath = &quot;/tmp/files&quot;
  stripPrefix = &quot;static&quot;
  httpUser = &quot;abc&quot;
  httpPassword = &quot;abc&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `localAddr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_https2http&quot;
  type = &quot;https&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;test.example.com&quot;]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;https2http&quot;
  localAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:80&quot;
  crtPath = &quot;./server.crt&quot;
  keyPath = &quot;./server.key&quot;
  hostHeaderRewrite = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = &quot;frp&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `secretKey` field for the preshared key, and that the `remotePort` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`secretKey` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn&#039;t work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

These configuration files is for reference only. Please do not use this configuration directly to run the program as it may have various issues.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps_full_example.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc_full_example.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go&#039;s standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}&quot;
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = {{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remember to prefix your reference with `.Envs`.

## Quick Start

Higress can be started with just Docker, making it convenient for individual developers to set up locally for learning or for building simple sites:

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir higress; cd higress
# Start higress, configuration files will be written to the working directory
docker run -d --rm --name higress-ai -v ${PWD}:/data \
        -p 8001:8001 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443  \
        higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/higress/all-in-one:latest
```

Port descriptions:

- Port 8001: Higress UI console entry
- Port 8080: Gateway HTTP protocol entry
- Port 8443: Gateway HTTPS protocol entry

&gt; All Higress Docker images use Higress&#039;s own image repository and are not affected by Docker Hub rate limits.
&gt; In addition, the submission and updates of the images are protected by a security scanning mechanism (powered by Alibaba Cloud ACR), making them very secure for use in production environments.
&gt; 
&gt; If you experience a timeout when pulling image from `higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com`, you can try replacing it with the following docker registry mirror source:
&gt; 
&gt; **Southeast Asia**: `higress-registry.ap-southeast-7.cr.aliyuncs.com`

For other installation methods such as Helm deployment under K8s, please refer to the official [Quick Start documentation](https://higress.io/en-us/docs/user/quickstart).

## Documentation

Ready to dive into tRPC-Agent-Go? Our [documentation](https://trpc-group.github.io/trpc-agent-go/) covers everything from basic concepts to advanced techniques, helping you build powerful AI applications with confidence. Whether you&#039;re new to AI agents or an experienced developer, you&#039;ll find detailed guides, practical examples, and best practices to accelerate your development journey.

## ⚡ Quick Start

&gt; 🎬 **See it in Action**: _[Demo GIF placeholder - showing agent reasoning and tool usage]_

### 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Go 1.21 or later
- 🔑 LLM provider API key (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.)
- 💡 5 minutes to build your first intelligent agent

### 🚀 Run the Example

**Get started in 3 simple steps:**

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-go.git
cd trpc-agent-go

# 2️⃣ Configure your LLM
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=&quot;your-base-url-here&quot;  # Optional

# 3️⃣ Run your first agent! 🎉
cd examples/runner
go run . -model=&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot; -streaming=true
```

**What you&#039;ll see:**

- 💬 **Interactive chat** with your AI agent
- ⚡ **Real-time streaming** responses
- 🧮 **Tool usage** (calculator + time tools)
- 🔄 **Multi-turn conversations** with memory

Try asking: &quot;What&#039;s the current time? Then calculate 15 \* 23 + 100&quot;

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;context&quot;
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;log&quot;

    &quot;trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/agent/llmagent&quot;
    &quot;trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/model&quot;
    &quot;trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/model/openai&quot;
    &quot;trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/runner&quot;
    &quot;trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/tool&quot;
    &quot;trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/tool/function&quot;
)

func main() {
    // Create model.
    modelInstance := openai.New(&quot;deepseek-chat&quot;)

    // Create tool.
    calculatorTool := function.NewFunctionTool(
        calculator,
        function.WithName(&quot;calculator&quot;),
        function.WithDescription(&quot;Execute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. &quot;+
            &quot;Parameters: a, b are numeric values, op takes values add/sub/mul/div; &quot;+
            &quot;returns result as the calculation result.&quot;),
    )

    // Enable streaming output.
    genConfig := model.GenerationConfig{
        Stream: true,
    }

    // Create Agent.
    agent := llmagent.New(&quot;assistant&quot;,
        llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
        llmagent.WithTools([]tool.Tool{calculatorTool}),
        llmagent.WithGenerationConfig(genConfig),
    )

    // Create Runner.
    runner := runner.NewRunner(&quot;calculator-app&quot;, agent)

    // Execute conversation.
    ctx := context.Background()
    events, err := runner.Run(ctx,
        &quot;user-001&quot;,
        &quot;session-001&quot;,
        model.NewUserMessage(&quot;Calculate what 2+3 equals&quot;),
    )
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Process event stream.
    for event := range events {
        if event.Object == &quot;chat.completion.chunk&quot; {
            fmt.Print(event.Response.Choices[0].Delta.Content)
        }
    }
    fmt.Println()
}

func calculator(ctx context.Context, req calculatorReq) (calculatorRsp, error) {
    var result float64
    switch req.Op {
    case &quot;add&quot;, &quot;+&quot;:
        result = req.A + req.B
    case &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;-&quot;:
        result = req.A - req.B
    case &quot;mul&quot;, &quot;*&quot;:
        result = req.A * req.B
    case &quot;div&quot;, &quot;/&quot;:
        result = req.A / req.B
	default:
		return calculatorRsp{}, fmt.Errorf(&quot;invalid operation: %s&quot;, req.Op)
    }
    return calculatorRsp{Result: result}, nil
}

type calculatorReq struct {
    A  float64 `json:&quot;A&quot;  jsonschema:&quot;description=First integer operand,required&quot;`
    B  float64 `json:&quot;B&quot;  jsonschema:&quot;description=Second integer operand,required&quot;`
    Op string  `json:&quot;Op&quot; jsonschema:&quot;description=Operation type,enum=add,enum=sub,enum=mul,enum=div,required&quot;`
}

type calculatorRsp struct {
    Result float64 `json:&quot;result&quot;`
}
```

    return graph.State{&quot;a&quot;: 1}, nil
})
sg.AddNode(&quot;B&quot;, func(ctx context.Context, s graph.State) (any, error) {
    return graph.State{&quot;b&quot;: 1}, nil
})
sg.SetEntryPoint(&quot;router&quot;)
sg.AddMultiConditionalEdges(
    &quot;router&quot;,
    func(ctx context.Context, s graph.State) ([]string, error) {
        return []string{&quot;goA&quot;, &quot;goB&quot;}, nil
    },
    map[string]string{&quot;goA&quot;: &quot;A&quot;, &quot;goB&quot;: &quot;B&quot;}, // Path map or ends map

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Architecture

![architecture](docs/mkdocs/assets/img/component_architecture.png)

### 🔄 **Execution Flow**

1. **🚀 Runner** orchestrates the entire execution pipeline with session management
2. **🤖 Agent** processes requests using multiple specialized components
3. **🧠 Planner** determines the optimal strategy and tool selection
4. **🛠️ Tools** execute specific tasks (API calls, calculations, web searches)
5. **💾 Memory** maintains context and learns from interactions
6. **📚 Knowledge** provides RAG capabilities for document understanding

Key packages:

| Package     | Responsibility                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent`     | Core execution unit, responsible for processing user input and generating responses.                        |
| `runner`    | Agent executor, responsible for managing execution flow and connecting Session/Memory Service capabilities. |
| `model`     | Supports multiple LLM models (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.).                                                      |
| `tool`      | Provides various tool capabilities (Function, MCP, DuckDuckGo, etc.).                                       |
| `session`   | Manages user session state and events.                                                                      |
| `memory`    | Records user long-term memory and personalized information.                                                 |
| `knowledge` | Implements RAG knowledge retrieval capabilities.                                                            |
| `planner`   | Provides Agent planning and reasoning capabilities.                                                         |

Execution flow
![execution](docs/mkdocs/assets/img/timing_diagram.png)

## Using Built-in Agents

For most applications you **do not** need to implement the `agent.Agent`
interface yourself. The framework already ships with several ready-to-use
agents that you can compose like Lego bricks:

| Agent           | Purpose                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `LLMAgent`      | Wraps an LLM chat-completion model as an agent.     |
| `ChainAgent`    | Executes sub-agents sequentially.                   |
| `ParallelAgent` | Executes sub-agents concurrently and merges output. |
| `CycleAgent`    | Loops over a planner + executor until stop signal.  |

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Example

```go
// 1. Create a base LLM agent.
base := llmagent.New(
    &quot;assistant&quot;,
    llmagent.WithModel(openai.New(&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;)),
)

// 2. Create a second LLM agent with a different instruction.
translator := llmagent.New(
    &quot;translator&quot;,
    llmagent.WithInstruction(&quot;Translate everything to French&quot;),
    llmagent.WithModel(openai.New(&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;)),
)

// 3. Combine them in a chain.
pipeline := chainagent.New(
    &quot;pipeline&quot;,
    chainagent.WithSubAgents([]agent.Agent{base, translator}),
)

// 4. Run through the runner for sessions &amp; telemetry.
run := runner.NewRunner(&quot;demo-app&quot;, pipeline)
events, _ := run.Run(ctx, &quot;user-1&quot;, &quot;sess-1&quot;,
    model.NewUserMessage(&quot;Hello!&quot;))
for ev := range events { /* ... */ }
```

The composition API lets you nest chains, cycles, or parallels to build complex
workflows without low-level plumbing.

[Coder](https://coder.com) enables organizations to set up development environments in their public or private cloud infrastructure. Cloud development environments are defined with Terraform, connected through a secure high-speed Wireguard® tunnel, and automatically shut down when not used to save on costs. Coder gives engineering teams the flexibility to use the cloud for workloads most beneficial to them.

- Define cloud development environments in Terraform
  - EC2 VMs, Kubernetes Pods, Docker Containers, etc.
- Automatically shutdown idle resources to save on costs
- Onboard developers in seconds instead of days

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/hero-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Coder Hero Image&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Quickstart

The most convenient way to try Coder is to install it on your local machine and experiment with provisioning cloud development environments using Docker (works on Linux, macOS, and Windows).

```shell
# First, install Coder
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh

# Start the Coder server (caches data in ~/.cache/coder)
coder server

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to create your initial user,
# create a Docker template and provision a workspace
```

## Install

The easiest way to install Coder is to use our
[install script](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/install.sh) for Linux
and macOS. For Windows, use the latest `..._installer.exe` file from GitHub
Releases.

```shell
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can run the install script with `--dry-run` to see the commands that will be used to install without executing them. Run the install script with `--help` for additional flags.

&gt; See [install](https://coder.com/docs/install) for additional methods.

Once installed, you can start a production deployment with a single command:

```shell
# Automatically sets up an external access URL on *.try.coder.app
coder server

# Requires a PostgreSQL instance (version 13 or higher) and external access URL
coder server --postgres-url &lt;url&gt; --access-url &lt;url&gt;
```

Use `coder --help` to get a list of flags and environment variables. Use our [install guides](https://coder.com/docs/install) for a complete walkthrough.

Obot is an open-source platform that solves the key challenges of adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) at enterprise scale. Built for organizations that need to securely discover, manage, and govern AI integrations across their infrastructure.

## The Challenge

MCP is the industry standard that connects AI applications to your systems and data. But enterprise adoption faces critical challenges:

- **Discovery**: How do users find the right MCP servers without a sprawling, ungoverned catalog?
- **Security**: How do you validate server security, enforce access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit trails?
- **Operations**: How do you automate authentication, scale infrastructure as usage grows, and roll out updates across environments?
- **Governance**: How do you intercept unsafe requests and enforce corporate policies before they reach your systems?

Obot solves these challenges with a comprehensive management platform.

## Getting Started

To quickly try out Obot&#039;s end-user experience, visit [https://chat.obot.ai](https://chat.obot.ai). Note that you won&#039;t experience the administrative features here. 

To run Obot yourself, launch it using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name obot -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;API KEY&gt; \
  ghcr.io/obot-platform/obot:latest
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the Obot UI.

&gt; **Note**: Replace `&lt;API KEY&gt;` with your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). You can also set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to use Anthropic models, or configure model providers through the Admin UI.

For more installation methods, see our [Installation Guide](https://docs.obot.ai/installation/general).

## Platform Features

Obot consists of four key pillars:

### MCP Hosting

Deploy and manage MCP servers without operational overhead:

- **Production-Ready Infrastructure** – Test locally with Docker or deploy to Kubernetes for enterprise-grade workload management, scheduling, and resource allocation
- **Flexible Deployment** – Run Node.js, Python, or containerized MCP servers in secure sandboxed environments
- **Multiple Server Types** – Run single-user STDIO servers or multi-user streamable HTTP servers
- **Role-Based Deployment** – Control who can deploy servers from the catalog, create custom servers, or share servers with others
- **OAuth 2.1 and Token Management** – Obot handles secure authentication and credential management so developers focus on server functionality

### MCP Registry

Centralized discovery and distribution of MCP servers:

- **Curated Catalog** – IT teams manage which MCP servers are available to users
- **Corporate Credentials** – Users access servers using existing authentication
- **MCP Registry Specification** – Conforms to the official standard for maximum client compatibility
- **Role-Based Discovery** – Users see only the servers they&#039;re authorized to access

### MCP Gateway

Secure, governed access to MCP servers:

- **Access Control Rules** – Define which users and groups can access specific servers
- **Usage Analytics** – Understand which servers are most valuable to your organization
- **Audit Trails** – Log all MCP server interactions for compliance and security review
- **Request Filtering** – Intercept and programmatically inspect MCP calls to enforce custom business logic and security policies

### Obot Chat

Production-ready chat interface with enterprise capabilities:

- **Multi-LLM Support** – Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers
- **Knowledge Integration** – Add domain-specific information to conversations with built-in RAG
- **Memory** – Maintain context across conversations for personalized interactions
- **Project Templates** – Create and share reusable project configurations across teams
- **Automated Tasks** – Schedule recurring tasks on a cron for workflow automation

## How It Works Together

1. **IT Administrators** curate MCP servers in the **Registry** and define access policies
1. **Security Teams** monitor usage, audit activity, and enforce compliance through the **Core Platform**
1. **Developers** build and deploy MCP servers using **Hosting** infrastructure
1. **Users** discover authorized servers through the **Gateway** and interact via **Chat** or third-party *MCP clients*

## Technical Highlights

- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy on your own infrastructure for complete control over data and security
- **MCP Standard**: Built on the open Model Context Protocol for maximum interoperability
- **Enterprise Security**: OAuth 2.1, encryption at rest and in transit, comprehensive audit logging
- **Extensible**: Easy integration with custom tools, services, and existing enterprise systems
- **GitOps Ready**: Manage catalog and configuration as code

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Installation

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose using provided directory structure (recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a new directory called `glance` as well as the template files within it by running:

```bash
mkdir glance &amp;&amp; cd glance &amp;&amp; curl -sL https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xzf - --strip-components 2
```

*[click here to view the files that will be created](https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/tree/main/root)*

Then, edit the following files as desired:
* `docker-compose.yml` to configure the port, volumes and other containery things
* `config/home.yml` to configure the widgets or layout of the home page
* `config/glance.yml` if you want to change the theme or add more pages

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Other files you may want to edit&lt;/summary&gt;

* `.env` to configure environment variables that will be available inside configuration files
* `assets/user.css` to add custom CSS
&lt;/details&gt;

When ready, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose manual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  glance:
    container_name: glance
    image: glanceapp/glance
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Then, create a new directory called `config` and download the example starting [`glance.yml`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/glance.yml) file into it by running:

```bash
mkdir config &amp;&amp; wget -O config/glance.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

Feel free to edit the `glance.yml` file to your liking, and when ready run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker logs glance
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual binary installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Precompiled binaries are available for Linux, Windows and macOS (x86, x86_64, ARM and ARM64 architectures).

### Linux

Visit the [latest release page](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) for available binaries. You can place the binary in `/opt/glance/` and have it start with your server via a [systemd service](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/). By default, when running the binary, it will look for a `glance.yml` file in the directory it&#039;s placed in. To specify a different path for the config file, use the `--config` option:

```bash
/opt/glance/glance --config /etc/glance.yml
```

To grab a starting template for the config file, run:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

### Windows

Download and extract the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) (most likely the file called `glance-windows-amd64.zip` if you&#039;re on a 64-bit system) and place it in a folder of your choice. Then, create a new text file called `glance.yml` in the same folder and paste the content from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml) in it. You should then be able to run the executable and access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.



&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Glance can also be installed through the following 3rd party channels:
* [Proxmox VE Helper Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=glance)
* [NixOS package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&amp;show=glance)
* [Coolify.io](https://coolify.io/docs/services/glance/)

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Common issues
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requests timing out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The most common cause of this is when using Pi-Hole, AdGuard Home or other ad-blocking DNS services, which by default have a fairly low rate limit. Depending on the number of widgets you have in a single page, this limit can very easily be exceeded. To fix this, increase the rate limit in the settings of your DNS service.

If using Podman, in some rare cases the timeout can be caused by an unknown issue, in which case it may be resolved by adding the following to the bottom of your `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
networks:
  podman:
    external: true
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken layout for markets, bookmarks or other widgets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

This is almost always caused by the browser extension Dark Reader. To fix this, disable dark mode for the domain where Glance is hosted.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cannot unmarshal !!map into []glance.page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The most common cause of this is having a `pages` key in your `glance.yml` and then also having a `pages` key inside one of your included pages. To fix this, remove the `pages` key from the top of your included pages.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## FAQ
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the information on the page update automatically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No, a page refresh is required to update the information. Some things do dynamically update where it makes sense, like the clock widget and the relative time showing how long ago something happened.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequently do widgets update?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No requests are made periodically in the background, information is only fetched upon loading the page and then cached. The default cache lifetime is different for each widget and can be configured.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I create my own widgets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, there are multiple ways to create custom widgets:
* `iframe` widget - allows you to embed things from other websites
* `html` widget - allows you to insert your own static HTML
* `extension` widget - fetch HTML from a URL
* `custom-api` widget - fetch JSON from a URL and render it using custom HTML
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I change the title of a widget?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, the title of all widgets can be changed by specifying the `title` property in the widget&#039;s configuration:

```yaml
- type: rss
  title: My custom title

- type: markets
  title: My custom title

- type: videos
  title: My custom title

# and so on for all widgets...
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Feature requests

New feature suggestions are always welcome and will be considered, though please keep in mind that some of them may be out of scope for what the project is trying to achieve (or is reasonably capable of). If you have an idea for a new feature and would like to share it, you can do so [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

Feature requests are tagged with one of the following:

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/roadmap) - will be implemented in a future release
* [Backlog](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/backlog) - may be implemented in the future but needs further feedback or interest from the community
* [Icebox](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/icebox) - no plans to implement as it doesn&#039;t currently align with the project&#039;s goals or capabilities, may be revised at a later date

&lt;br&gt;

## Building from source

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build binary with Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) &gt;= v1.23

To build the project for your current OS and architecture, run:

```bash
go build -o build/glance .
```

To build for a specific OS and architecture, run:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/glance .
```

[*click here for a full list of GOOS and GOARCH combinations*](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#:~:text=$GOOS%20and%20$GOARCH)

Alternatively, if you just want to run the app without creating a binary, like when you&#039;re testing out changes, you can run:

```bash
go run .
```
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build project and Docker image with Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To build the project and image using just Docker, run:

*(replace `owner` with your name or organization)*

```bash
docker build -t owner/glance:latest .
```

If you wish to push the image to a registry (by default Docker Hub), run:

```bash
docker push owner/glance:latest
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Contributing guidelines

* Before working on a new feature it&#039;s preferable to submit a feature request first and state that you&#039;d like to implement it yourself
* Please don&#039;t submit PRs for feature requests that are either in the roadmap&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;, backlog&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; or icebox&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Use `dev` for the base branch if you&#039;re adding new features or fixing bugs, otherwise use `main`
* Avoid introducing new dependencies
* Avoid making backwards-incompatible configuration changes
* Avoid introducing new colors or hard-coding colors, use the standard `primary`, `positive` and `negative`
* For icons, try to use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) where applicable
* Provide a screenshot of the changes if UI related where possible
* No `package.json`

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1] [2] [3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

[1] The feature likely already has work put into it that may conflict with your implementation

[2] The demand, implementation or functionality for this feature is not yet clear

[3] No plans to add this feature for the time being

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Introduction

The traditional method of providing web interfaces to Go programs is via a built-in web server. Wails offers a different
approach: it provides the ability to wrap both Go code and a web frontend into a single binary. Tools are provided to
make this easy for you by handling project creation, compilation and bundling. All you have to do is get creative!

## Features

- Use standard Go for the backend
- Use any frontend technology you are already familiar with to build your UI
- Quickly create rich frontends for your Go programs using pre-built templates
- Easily call Go methods from Javascript
- Auto-generated Typescript definitions for your Go structs and methods
- Native Dialogs &amp; Menus
- Native Dark / Light mode support
- Supports modern translucency and &quot;frosted window&quot; effects
- Unified eventing system between Go and Javascript
- Powerful cli tool to quickly generate and build your projects
- Multiplatform
- Uses native rendering engines - _no embedded browser_!

### Roadmap

The project roadmap may be found [here](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions/1484). Please consult
it before creating an enhancement request.

## Getting Started

The installation instructions are on the [official website](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).

&lt;/p&gt;

## FAQ

- Is this an alternative to Electron?

  Depends on your requirements. It&#039;s designed to make it easy for Go programmers to make lightweight desktop
  applications or add a frontend to their existing applications. Wails does offer native elements such as menus
  and dialogs, so it could be considered a lightweight electron alternative.

- Who is this project aimed at?

  Go programmers who want to bundle an HTML/JS/CSS frontend with their applications, without resorting to creating a
  server and opening a browser to view it.

- What&#039;s with the name?

  When I saw WebView, I thought &quot;What I really want is tooling around building a WebView app, a bit like Rails is to
  Ruby&quot;. So initially it was a play on words (Webview on Rails). It just so happened to also be a homophone of the
  English name for the [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) I am from. So it stuck.

[PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) is an open source Go backend that includes:

- embedded database (_SQLite_) with **realtime subscriptions**
- built-in **files and users management**
- convenient **Admin dashboard UI**
- and simple **REST-ish API**

**For documentation and examples, please visit https://pocketbase.io/docs.**

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Please keep in mind that PocketBase is still under active development
&gt; and therefore full backward compatibility is not guaranteed before reaching v1.0.0.

## API SDK clients

The easiest way to interact with the PocketBase Web APIs is to use one of the official SDK clients:

- **JavaScript - [pocketbase/js-sdk](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk)** (_Browser, Node.js, React Native_)
- **Dart - [pocketbase/dart-sdk](https://github.com/pocketbase/dart-sdk)** (_Web, Mobile, Desktop, CLI_)

You could also check the recommendations in https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/.


## Overview

### Use as standalone app

You could download the prebuilt executable for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases).
Once downloaded, extract the archive and run `./pocketbase serve` in the extracted directory.

The prebuilt executables are based on the [`examples/base/main.go` file](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/blob/master/examples/base/main.go) and comes with the JS VM plugin enabled by default which allows to extend PocketBase with JavaScript (_for more details please refer to [Extend with JavaScript](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/)_).

### Use as a Go framework/toolkit

PocketBase is distributed as a regular Go library package which allows you to build
your own custom app specific business logic and still have a single portable executable at the end.

Here is a minimal example:

0. [Install Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/doc/install) (_if you haven&#039;t already_)

1. Create a new project directory with the following `main.go` file inside it:
    ```go
    package main

    import (
        &quot;log&quot;

        &quot;github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase&quot;
        &quot;github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core&quot;
    )

    func main() {
        app := pocketbase.New()

        app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
            // registers new &quot;GET /hello&quot; route
            se.Router.GET(&quot;/hello&quot;, func(re *core.RequestEvent) error {
                return re.String(200, &quot;Hello world!&quot;)
            })

            return se.Next()
        })

        if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
    }
    ```

2. To init the dependencies, run `go mod init myapp &amp;&amp; go mod tidy`.

3. To start the application, run `go run main.go serve`.

4. To build a statically linked executable, you can run `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build` and then start the created executable with `./myapp serve`.

_For more details please refer to [Extend with Go](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/)._

### Building and running the repo main.go example

To build the minimal standalone executable, like the prebuilt ones in the releases page, you can simply run `go build` inside the `examples/base` directory:

0. [Install Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/doc/install) (_if you haven&#039;t already_)
1. Clone/download the repo
2. Navigate to `examples/base`
3. Run `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build`
   (_https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment_)
4. Start the created executable by running `./base serve`.

Note that the supported build targets by the pure Go SQLite driver at the moment are:

```
darwin  amd64
darwin  arm64
freebsd amd64
freebsd arm64
linux   386
linux   amd64
linux   arm
linux   arm64
linux   loong64
linux   ppc64le
linux   riscv64
linux   s390x
windows 386
windows amd64
windows arm64
```

### Testing

PocketBase comes with mixed bag of unit and integration tests.
To run them, use the standard `go test` command:

```sh
go test ./...
```

Check also the [Testing guide](http://pocketbase.io/docs/testing) to learn how to write your own custom application tests.

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability within PocketBase, please send an e-mail to **support at pocketbase.io**.

All reports will be promptly addressed and you&#039;ll be credited in the fix release notes.

## Contributing

PocketBase is free and open source project licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
You are free to do whatever you want with it, even offering it as a paid service.

You could help continuing its development by:

- [Contribute to the source code](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Suggest new features and report issues](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/issues)

PRs for new OAuth2 providers, bug fixes, code optimizations and documentation improvements are more than welcome.

But please refrain creating PRs for _new features_ without previously discussing the implementation details.
PocketBase has a [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/pocketbase/projects/2) and I try to work on issues in specific order and such PRs often come in out of nowhere and skew all initial planning with tedious back-and-forth communication.

Don&#039;t get upset if I close your PR, even if it is well executed and tested. This doesn&#039;t mean that it will never be merged.
Later we can always refer to it and/or take pieces of your implementation when the time comes to work on the issue (don&#039;t worry you&#039;ll be credited in the release notes).

A [Model Context Protocol][mcp] (MCP) server for Grafana.

This provides access to your Grafana instance and the surrounding ecosystem.

## Requirements

- **Grafana version 9.0 or later** is required for full functionality. Some features, particularly datasource-related operations, may not work correctly with earlier versions due to missing API endpoints.

## Features

_The following features are currently available in MCP server. This list is for informational purposes only and does not represent a roadmap or commitment to future features._

### Dashboards

- **Search for dashboards:** Find dashboards by title or other metadata
- **Get dashboard by UID:** Retrieve full dashboard details using its unique identifier. _Warning: Large dashboards can consume significant context window space._
- **Get dashboard summary:** Get a compact overview of a dashboard including title, panel count, panel types, variables, and metadata without the full JSON to minimize context window usage
- **Get dashboard property:** Extract specific parts of a dashboard using JSONPath expressions (e.g., `$.title`, `$.panels[*].title`) to fetch only needed data and reduce context window consumption
- **Update or create a dashboard:** Modify existing dashboards or create new ones. _Warning: Requires full dashboard JSON which can consume large amounts of context window space._
- **Patch dashboard:** Apply specific changes to a dashboard without requiring the full JSON, significantly reducing context window usage for targeted modifications
- **Get panel queries and datasource info:** Get the title, query string, and datasource information (including UID and type, if available) from every panel in a dashboard

#### Context Window Management

The dashboard tools now include several strategies to manage context window usage effectively ([issue #101](https://github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/issues/101)):

- **Use `get_dashboard_summary`** for dashboard overview and planning modifications
- **Use `get_dashboard_property`** with JSONPath when you only need specific dashboard parts
- **Avoid `get_dashboard_by_uid`** unless you specifically need the complete dashboard JSON

### Datasources

- **List and fetch datasource information:** View all configured datasources and retrieve detailed information about each.
  - _Supported datasource types: Prometheus, Loki._

### Prometheus Querying

- **Query Prometheus:** Execute PromQL queries (supports both instant and range metric queries) against Prometheus datasources.
- **Query Prometheus metadata:** Retrieve metric metadata, metric names, label names, and label values from Prometheus datasources.

### Loki Querying

- **Query Loki logs and metrics:** Run both log queries and metric queries using LogQL against Loki datasources.
- **Query Loki metadata:** Retrieve label names, label values, and stream statistics from Loki datasources.

### Incidents

- **Search, create, and update incidents:** Manage incidents in Grafana Incident, including searching, creating, and adding activities to incidents.

### Sift Investigations

- **List Sift investigations:** Retrieve a list of Sift investigations, with support for a limit parameter.
- **Get Sift investigation:** Retrieve details of a specific Sift investigation by its UUID.
- **Get Sift analyses:** Retrieve a specific analysis from a Sift investigation.
- **Find error patterns in logs:** Detect elevated error patterns in Loki logs using Sift.
- **Find slow requests:** Detect slow requests using Sift (Tempo).

### Alerting

- **List and fetch alert rule information:** View alert rules and their statuses (firing/normal/error/etc.) in Grafana. Supports both Grafana-managed rules and datasource-managed rules from Prometheus or Loki datasources.
- **List contact points:** View configured notification contact points in Grafana. Supports both Grafana-managed contact points and receivers from external Alertmanager datasources (Prometheus Alertmanager, Mimir, Cortex).

### Grafana OnCall

- **List and manage schedules:** View and manage on-call schedules in Grafana OnCall.
- **Get shift details:** Retrieve detailed information about specific on-call shifts.
- **Get current on-call users:** See which users are currently on call for a schedule.
- **List teams and users:** View all OnCall teams and users.
- **List alert groups:** View and filter alert groups from Grafana OnCall by various criteria including state, integration, labels, and time range.
- **Get alert group details:** Retrieve detailed information about a specific alert group by its ID.

### Admin

&gt; **Note:** Admin tools are **disabled by default**. To enable them, include `admin` in your `--enabled-tools` flag.
- **List teams:** View all configured teams in Grafana.
- **List Users:** View all users in an organization in Grafana.
- **List all roles:** List all Grafana roles, with an optional filter for delegatable roles.

### Navigation

- **Generate deeplinks:** Create accurate deeplink URLs for Grafana resources instead of relying on LLM URL guessing.
  - **Dashboard links:** Generate direct links to dashboards using their UID (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/d/dashboard-uid`)
  - **Panel links:** Create links to specific panels within dashboards with viewPanel parameter (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/d/dashboard-uid?viewPanel=5`)
  - **Explore links:** Generate links to Grafana Explore with pre-configured datasources (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/explore?left={&quot;datasource&quot;:&quot;prometheus-uid&quot;}`)

- **Update Annotation:** Replace all fields of an existing annotation (full update).
- **Patch Annotation:** Update only specific fields of an annotation (partial update).
- **Get Annotation Tags:** List available annotation tags with optional filtering.


The list of tools is configurable, so you can choose which tools you want to make available to the MCP client.
This is useful if you don&#039;t use certain functionality or if you don&#039;t want to take up too much of the context window.
To disable a category of tools, use the `--disable-&lt;category&gt;` flag when starting the server. For example, to disable
the OnCall tools, use `--disable-oncall`, or to disable navigation deeplink generation, use `--disable-navigation`.


#### RBAC Permissions

Each tool requires specific RBAC permissions to function properly. When creating a service account for the MCP server, ensure it has the necessary permissions based on which tools you plan to use. The permissions listed are the minimum required actions - you may also need appropriate scopes (e.g., `datasources:*`, `dashboards:*`, `folders:*`) depending on your use case.

Tip: If you&#039;re not familiar with Grafana RBAC or you want a quicker, simpler setup instead of configuring many granular scopes, you can assign a built-in role such as `Editor` to the service account. The `Editor` role grants broad read/write access that will allow most MCP server operations; it is less granular (and therefore less restrictive) than manually-applied scopes, so use it only when convenience is more important than strict least-privilege access.

**Note:** Grafana Incident and Sift tools use basic Grafana roles instead of fine-grained RBAC permissions:
- **Viewer role:** Required for read-only operations (list incidents, get investigations)
- **Editor role:** Required for write operations (create incidents, modify investigations)

For more information about Grafana RBAC, see the [official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/).

#### RBAC Scopes

Scopes define the specific resources that permissions apply to. Each action requires both the appropriate permission and scope combination.

**Common Scope Patterns:**

- **Broad access:** Use `*` wildcards for organization-wide access

  - `datasources:*` - Access to all datasources
  - `dashboards:*` - Access to all dashboards
  - `folders:*` - Access to all folders
  - `teams:*` - Access to all teams

- **Limited access:** Use specific UIDs or IDs to restrict access to individual resources
  - `datasources:uid:prometheus-uid` - Access only to a specific Prometheus datasource
  - `dashboards:uid:abc123` - Access only to dashboard with UID `abc123`
  - `folders:uid:xyz789` - Access only to folder with UID `xyz789`
  - `teams:id:5` - Access only to team with ID `5`
  - `global.users:id:123` - Access only to user with ID `123`

**Examples:**

- **Full MCP server access:** Grant broad permissions for all tools

  ```
  datasources:* (datasources:read, datasources:query)
  dashboards:* (dashboards:read, dashboards:create, dashboards:write)
  folders:* (for dashboard creation and alert rules)
  teams:* (teams:read)
  global.users:* (users:read)
  ```

- **Limited datasource access:** Only query specific Prometheus and Loki instances

  ```
  datasources:uid:prometheus-prod (datasources:query)
  datasources:uid:loki-prod (datasources:query)
  ```

- **Dashboard-specific access:** Read only specific dashboards
  ```
  dashboards:uid:monitoring-dashboard (dashboards:read)
  dashboards:uid:alerts-dashboard (dashboards:read)
  ```

![OAuth2 Proxy](docs/static/img/logos/OAuth2_Proxy_horizontal.svg)

OAuth2-Proxy is a flexible, open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. It provides a simple and secure way to protect your web applications with OAuth2 / OIDC authentication. As a reverse proxy, it intercepts requests to your application and redirects users to an OAuth2 provider for authentication. As a middleware, it can be seamlessly integrated into your existing infrastructure to handle authentication for multiple applications.

OAuth2-Proxy supports a lot of OAuth2 as well as OIDC providers. Either through a generic OIDC client or a specific implementation for Google, Microsoft Entra ID, GitHub, login.gov and others. Through specialised provider implementations oauth2-proxy can extract more details about the user like preferred usernames and groups. Those details can then be forwarded as HTTP headers to your upstream applications.

![Simplified Architecture](docs/static/img/simplified-architecture.svg)

## Get Started

OAuth2-Proxy&#039;s [Installation Docs](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/installation) cover how to install and configure your setup. Additionally you can take a further look at the [example setup files](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/tree/master/contrib/local-environment).

## Releases

### Binaries
We publish oauth2-proxy as compiled binaries on GitHub for all major architectures as well as more exotic ones like `ppc64le` as well as `s390x`.

Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/latest).

### Images

From `v7.6.0` and up the base image has been changed from Alpine to [GoogleContainerTools/distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).
This image comes with even fewer installed dependencies and thus should improve security. The image therefore is also slightly smaller than Alpine.
For debugging purposes (and those who really need it. e.g. `armv6`) we still provide images based on Alpine. The tags of these images are suffixed with `-alpine`.

Since 2023-11-18 we build nightly images directly from the `master` branch and provide them at `quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy-nightly`.
These images are considered unstable and therefore should **NOT** be used for production purposes unless you know what you&#039;re doing.
