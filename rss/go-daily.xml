### Installation

```bash
# YOLO
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Package managers
npm i -g opencode-ai@latest        # or bun/pnpm/yarn
brew install sst/tap/opencode      # macOS
paru -S opencode-bin               # Arch Linux
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Remove versions older than 0.1.x before installing.

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Documentation

For more info on how to configure opencode [**head over to our docs**](https://opencode.ai/docs).

### Contributing

opencode is an opinionated tool so any fundamental feature needs to go through a
design process with the core team.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; We do not accept PRs for core features.

However we still merge a ton of PRs - you can contribute:

- Bug fixes
- Improvements to LLM performance
- Support for new providers
- Fixes for env specific quirks
- Missing standard behavior
- Documentation

Take a look at the git history to see what kind of PRs we end up merging.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you do not follow the above guidelines we might close your PR.

To run opencode locally you need.

- Bun
- Golang 1.24.x

And run.

```bash
$ bun install
$ bun run packages/opencode/src/index.ts
```

#### Development Notes

**API Client**: After making changes to the TypeScript API endpoints in `packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts`, you will need the opencode team to generate a new stainless sdk for the clients.

### FAQ

#### How is this different than Claude Code?

It&#039;s very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although Anthropic is recommended, opencode can be used with OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- A focus on TUI. opencode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what&#039;s possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow opencode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.

#### What&#039;s the other repo?

The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).

## What is KubeSphere

&gt; English | [中文](README_zh.md)

[KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/) is a **distributed operating system for cloud-native application management**,
using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as its kernel. It provides a plug-and-play architecture, allowing third-party
applications to be seamlessly integrated into its ecosystem. KubeSphere is also a multi-tenant container platform with
full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly wizard web UI,
helping enterprises to build out a more robust and feature-rich platform, which includes most common functionalities
needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategy, see [Feature List](#features) for details.

The following screenshots give a close insight into KubeSphere. Please
check [What is KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/docs/introduction/what-is-kubesphere/) for further information.

## Architecture

KubeSphere 4.x adopts a microkernel + extension components architecture ([codename LuBan](https://kubesphere.io/docs/v4.1/01-intro/01-introduction/)). The core part (KubeSphere Core) only includes the essential basic functions required for system operation, with independent functional modules split and provided in the form of extension components. Users can dynamically manage the extension components during system operation. With the extension capabilities, KubeSphere can support more application scenarios and meet the needs of different users.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Installation

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose using provided directory structure (recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a new directory called `glance` as well as the template files within it by running:

```bash
mkdir glance &amp;&amp; cd glance &amp;&amp; curl -sL https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xzf - --strip-components 2
```

*[click here to view the files that will be created](https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/tree/main/root)*

Then, edit the following files as desired:
* `docker-compose.yml` to configure the port, volumes and other containery things
* `config/home.yml` to configure the widgets or layout of the home page
* `config/glance.yml` if you want to change the theme or add more pages

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Other files you may want to edit&lt;/summary&gt;

* `.env` to configure environment variables that will be available inside configuration files
* `assets/user.css` to add custom CSS
&lt;/details&gt;

When ready, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose manual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  glance:
    container_name: glance
    image: glanceapp/glance
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Then, create a new directory called `config` and download the example starting [`glance.yml`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/glance.yml) file into it by running:

```bash
mkdir config &amp;&amp; wget -O config/glance.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

Feel free to edit the `glance.yml` file to your liking, and when ready run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker logs glance
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual binary installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Precompiled binaries are available for Linux, Windows and macOS (x86, x86_64, ARM and ARM64 architectures).

### Linux

Visit the [latest release page](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) for available binaries. You can place the binary in `/opt/glance/` and have it start with your server via a [systemd service](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/). By default, when running the binary, it will look for a `glance.yml` file in the directory it&#039;s placed in. To specify a different path for the config file, use the `--config` option:

```bash
/opt/glance/glance --config /etc/glance.yml
```

To grab a starting template for the config file, run:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

### Windows

Download and extract the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) (most likely the file called `glance-windows-amd64.zip` if you&#039;re on a 64-bit system) and place it in a folder of your choice. Then, create a new text file called `glance.yml` in the same folder and paste the content from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml) in it. You should then be able to run the executable and access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.



&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Glance can also be installed through the following 3rd party channels:
* [Proxmox VE Helper Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=glance)
* [NixOS package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&amp;show=glance)
* [Coolify.io](https://coolify.io/docs/services/glance/)

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Common issues
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requests timing out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The most common cause of this is when using Pi-Hole, AdGuard Home or other ad-blocking DNS services, which by default have a fairly low rate limit. Depending on the number of widgets you have in a single page, this limit can very easily be exceeded. To fix this, increase the rate limit in the settings of your DNS service.

If using Podman, in some rare cases the timeout can be caused by an unknown issue, in which case it may be resolved by adding the following to the bottom of your `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
networks:
  podman:
    external: true
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken layout for markets, bookmarks or other widgets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

This is almost always caused by the browser extension Dark Reader. To fix this, disable dark mode for the domain where Glance is hosted.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cannot unmarshal !!map into []glance.page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The most common cause of this is having a `pages` key in your `glance.yml` and then also having a `pages` key inside one of your included pages. To fix this, remove the `pages` key from the top of your included pages.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## FAQ
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the information on the page update automatically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No, a page refresh is required to update the information. Some things do dynamically update where it makes sense, like the clock widget and the relative time showing how long ago something happened.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequently do widgets update?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No requests are made periodically in the background, information is only fetched upon loading the page and then cached. The default cache lifetime is different for each widget and can be configured.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I create my own widgets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, there are multiple ways to create custom widgets:
* `iframe` widget - allows you to embed things from other websites
* `html` widget - allows you to insert your own static HTML
* `extension` widget - fetch HTML from a URL
* `custom-api` widget - fetch JSON from a URL and render it using custom HTML
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I change the title of a widget?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, the title of all widgets can be changed by specifying the `title` property in the widget&#039;s configuration:

```yaml
- type: rss
  title: My custom title

- type: markets
  title: My custom title

- type: videos
  title: My custom title

# and so on for all widgets...
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Feature requests

New feature suggestions are always welcome and will be considered, though please keep in mind that some of them may be out of scope for what the project is trying to achieve (or is reasonably capable of). If you have an idea for a new feature and would like to share it, you can do so [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

Feature requests are tagged with one of the following:

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/roadmap) - will be implemented in a future release
* [Backlog](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/backlog) - may be implemented in the future but needs further feedback or interest from the community
* [Icebox](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/icebox) - no plans to implement as it doesn&#039;t currently align with the project&#039;s goals or capabilities, may be revised at a later date

&lt;br&gt;

## Building from source

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build binary with Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) &gt;= v1.23

To build the project for your current OS and architecture, run:

```bash
go build -o build/glance .
```

To build for a specific OS and architecture, run:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/glance .
```

[*click here for a full list of GOOS and GOARCH combinations*](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#:~:text=$GOOS%20and%20$GOARCH)

Alternatively, if you just want to run the app without creating a binary, like when you&#039;re testing out changes, you can run:

```bash
go run .
```
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build project and Docker image with Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To build the project and image using just Docker, run:

*(replace `owner` with your name or organization)*

```bash
docker build -t owner/glance:latest .
```

If you wish to push the image to a registry (by default Docker Hub), run:

```bash
docker push owner/glance:latest
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Contributing guidelines

* Before working on a new feature it&#039;s preferable to submit a feature request first and state that you&#039;d like to implement it yourself
* Please don&#039;t submit PRs for feature requests that are either in the roadmap&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;, backlog&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; or icebox&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Use `dev` for the base branch if you&#039;re adding new features or fixing bugs, otherwise use `main`
* Avoid introducing new dependencies
* Avoid making backwards-incompatible configuration changes
* Avoid introducing new colors or hard-coding colors, use the standard `primary`, `positive` and `negative`
* For icons, try to use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) where applicable
* Provide a screenshot of the changes if UI related where possible
* No `package.json`

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1] [2] [3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

[1] The feature likely already has work put into it that may conflict with your implementation

[2] The demand, implementation or functionality for this feature is not yet clear

[3] No plans to add this feature for the time being

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Read more about [incoming sources](#incoming-sources)

#### Two-way audio

Supported sources:

- [RTSP cameras](#source-rtsp) with [ONVIF Profile T](https://www.onvif.org/specs/stream/ONVIF-Streaming-Spec.pdf) (back channel connection)
- [DVRIP](#source-dvrip) cameras
- [TP-Link Tapo](#source-tapo) cameras
- [Hikvision ISAPI](#source-isapi) cameras
- [Roborock vacuums](#source-roborock) models with cameras
- [Exec](#source-exec) audio on server
- [Any Browser](#incoming-browser) as IP-camera

Two-way audio can be used in browser with [WebRTC](#module-webrtc) technology. The browser will give access to the microphone only for HTTPS sites ([read more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52759992/how-to-access-camera-and-microphone-in-chrome-without-https)).

go2rtc also supports [play audio](#stream-to-camera) files and live streams on this cameras.

#### Source: RTSP

```yaml
streams:
  sonoff_camera: rtsp://rtsp:12345678@192.168.1.123/av_stream/ch0
  dahua_camera:
    - rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=0&amp;unicast=true&amp;proto=Onvif
    - rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=1#backchannel=0
  amcrest_doorbell:
    - rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.123:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=0#backchannel=0
  unifi_camera: rtspx://192.168.1.123:7441/fD6ouM72bWoFijxK
  glichy_camera: ffmpeg:rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.123/live/ch00_1 
```

**Recommendations**

- **Amcrest Doorbell** users may want to disable two-way audio, because with an active stream, you won&#039;t have a working call button. You need to add `#backchannel=0` to the end of your RTSP link in YAML config file
- **Dahua Doorbell** users may want to change [audio codec](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/issues/49#issuecomment-2127107379) for proper 2-way audio. Make sure not to request backchannel multiple times by adding `#backchannel=0` to other stream sources of the same doorbell. The `unicast=true&amp;proto=Onvif` is preferred for 2-way audio as this makes the doorbell accept multiple codecs for the incoming audio
- **Reolink** users may want NOT to use RTSP protocol at all, some camera models have a very awful, unusable stream implementation
- **Ubiquiti UniFi** users may want to disable HTTPS verification. Use `rtspx://` prefix instead of `rtsps://`. And don&#039;t use `?enableSrtp` [suffix](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/issues/81)
- **TP-Link Tapo** users may skip login and password, because go2rtc support login [without them](https://drmnsamoliu.github.io/video.html)
- If your camera has two RTSP links, you can add both as sources. This is useful when streams have different codecs, for example AAC audio with main stream and PCMU/PCMA audio with second stream
- If the stream from your camera is glitchy, try using [ffmpeg source](#source-ffmpeg). It will not add CPU load if you don&#039;t use transcoding
- If the stream from your camera is very glitchy, try to use transcoding with [ffmpeg source](#source-ffmpeg)

**Other options**

Format: `rtsp...#{param1}#{param2}#{param3}`

- Add custom timeout `#timeout=30` (in seconds)
- Ignore audio - `#media=video` or ignore video - `#media=audio` 
- Ignore two-way audio API `#backchannel=0` - important for some glitchy cameras
- Use WebSocket transport `#transport=ws...`

**RTSP over WebSocket**

```yaml
streams:
  # WebSocket with authorization, RTSP - without
  axis-rtsp-ws:  rtsp://192.168.1.123:4567/axis-media/media.amp?overview=0&amp;camera=1&amp;resolution=1280x720&amp;videoframeskipmode=empty&amp;Axis-Orig-Sw=true#transport=ws://user:pass@192.168.1.123:4567/rtsp-over-websocket
  # WebSocket without authorization, RTSP - with
  dahua-rtsp-ws: rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=1&amp;proto=Private3#transport=ws://192.168.1.123/rtspoverwebsocket
```

#### Source: RTMP

You can get a stream from an RTMP server, for example [Nginx with nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).

```yaml
streams:
  rtmp_stream: rtmp://192.168.1.123/live/camera1
```

#### Source: HTTP

Support Content-Type:

- **HTTP-FLV** (`video/x-flv`) - same as RTMP, but over HTTP
- **HTTP-JPEG** (`image/jpeg`) - camera snapshot link, can be converted by go2rtc to MJPEG stream
- **HTTP-MJPEG** (`multipart/x`) - simple MJPEG stream over HTTP
- **MPEG-TS** (`video/mpeg`) - legacy [streaming format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_transport_stream)

Source also supports HTTP and TCP streams with autodetection for different formats: **MJPEG**, **H.264/H.265 bitstream**, **MPEG-TS**.

```yaml
streams:
  # [HTTP-FLV] stream in video/x-flv format
  http_flv: http://192.168.1.123:20880/api/camera/stream/780900131155/657617
  
  # [JPEG] snapshots from Dahua camera, will be converted to MJPEG stream
  dahua_snap: http://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cgi-bin/snapshot.cgi?channel=1

  # [MJPEG] stream will be proxied without modification
  http_mjpeg: https://mjpeg.sanford.io/count.mjpeg

  # [MJPEG or H.264/H.265 bitstream or MPEG-TS]
  tcp_magic: tcp://192.168.1.123:12345

  # Add custom header
  custom_header: &quot;https://mjpeg.sanford.io/count.mjpeg#header=Authorization: Bearer XXX&quot;
```

**PS.** Dahua camera has a bug: if you select MJPEG codec for RTSP second stream, snapshot won&#039;t work.

#### Source: ONVIF

*[New in v1.5.0](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/releases/tag/v1.5.0)*

The source is not very useful if you already know RTSP and snapshot links for your camera. But it can be useful if you don&#039;t.

**WebUI &gt; Add** webpage support ONVIF autodiscovery. Your server must be on the same subnet as the camera. If you use Docker, you must use &quot;network host&quot;.

```yaml
streams:
  dahua1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123
  reolink1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123:8000
  tapo1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123:2020
```

#### Source: FFmpeg

You can get any stream, file or device via FFmpeg and push it to go2rtc. The app will automatically start FFmpeg with the proper arguments when someone starts watching the stream.

- FFmpeg preistalled for **Docker** and **Hass Add-on** users
- **Hass Add-on** users can target files from [/media](https://www.home-assistant.io/more-info/local-media/setup-media/) folder

Format: `ffmpeg:{input}#{param1}#{param2}#{param3}`. Examples:

```yaml
streams:
  # [FILE] all tracks will be copied without transcoding codecs
  file1: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4

  # [FILE] video will be transcoded to H264, audio will be skipped
  file2: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4#video=h264

  # [FILE] video will be copied, audio will be transcoded to PCMU
  file3: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4#video=copy#audio=pcmu

  # [HLS] video will be copied, audio will be skipped
  hls: ffmpeg:https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_16x9/gear5/prog_index.m3u8#video=copy

  # [MJPEG] video will be transcoded to H264
  mjpeg: ffmpeg:http://185.97.122.128/cgi-bin/faststream.jpg#video=h264

  # [RTSP] video with rotation, should be transcoded, so select H264
  rotate: ffmpeg:rtsp://12345678@192.168.1.123/av_stream/ch0#video=h264#rotate=90
```

All transcoding formats have [built-in templates](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/blob/master/internal/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.go): `h264`, `h265`, `opus`, `pcmu`, `pcmu/16000`, `pcmu/48000`, `pcma`, `pcma/16000`, `pcma/48000`, `aac`, `aac/16000`.

But you can override them via YAML config. You can also add your own formats to the config and use them with source params.

```yaml
ffmpeg:
  bin: ffmpeg  # path to ffmpeg binary
  h264: &quot;-codec:v libx264 -g:v 30 -preset:v superfast -tune:v zerolatency -profile:v main -level:v 4.1&quot;
  mycodec: &quot;-any args that supported by ffmpeg...&quot;
  myinput: &quot;-fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -timeout 5000000 -i {input}&quot;
  myraw: &quot;-ss 00:00:20&quot;
```

- You can use go2rtc stream name as ffmpeg input (ex. `ffmpeg:camera1#video=h264`)
- You can use `video` and `audio` params multiple times (ex. `#video=copy#audio=copy#audio=pcmu`)
- You can use `rotate` param with `90`, `180`, `270` or `-90` values, important with transcoding (ex. `#video=h264#rotate=90`)
- You can use `width` and/or `height` params, important with transcoding (ex. `#video=h264#width=1280`)
- You can use `drawtext` to add a timestamp (ex. `drawtext=x=2:y=2:fontsize=12:fontcolor=white:box=1:boxcolor=black`)
  - This will greatly increase the CPU of the server, even with hardware acceleration
- You can use `raw` param for any additional FFmpeg arguments (ex. `#raw=-vf transpose=1`)
- You can use `input` param to override default input template (ex. `#input=rtsp/udp` will change RTSP transport from TCP to UDP+TCP)
  - You can use raw input value (ex. `#input=-timeout 5000000 -i {input}`)
  - You can add your own input templates

Read more about [hardware acceleration](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/wiki/Hardware-acceleration).

**PS.** It is recommended to check the available hardware in the WebUI add page.

#### Source: FFmpeg Device

You can get video from any USB camera or Webcam as RTSP or WebRTC stream. This is part of FFmpeg integration.

- check available devices in web interface
- `video_size` and `framerate` must be supported by your camera!
- for Linux supported only video for now
- for macOS you can stream FaceTime camera or whole desktop!
- for macOS important to set right framerate

Format: `ffmpeg:device?{input-params}#{param1}#{param2}#{param

            <p>Staging repo for development of native port of TypeScript</p>
            <p>Language: Go</p>
            <p>Stars: 21,487</p>

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TypeScript 7

[Not sure what this is? Read the announcement post!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)

## Preview

A preview build is available on npm as [`@typescript/native-preview`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/native-preview).

```sh
npm install @typescript/native-preview
npx tsgo # Use this as you would tsc.
```

A preview VS Code extension is [available on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.native-preview).

To use this, set this in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    &quot;typescript.experimental.useTsgo&quot;: true
}
```

## How to Build and Run

This repo uses [Go 1.24 or higher](https://go.dev/dl/), [Rust 1.85 or higher](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/), and [`hereby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hereby).

For tests and code generation, this repo contains a git submodule to the main TypeScript repo pointing to the commit being ported.
When cloning, you&#039;ll want to clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go.git
```

If you have already cloned the repo, you can initialize the submodule with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

With the submodule in place and `npm ci`, you can run tasks via `hereby`, similar to the TypeScript repo:

```sh
hereby build          # Verify that the project builds
hereby test           # Run all tests
hereby install-tools  # Install additional tools such as linters
hereby lint           # Run all linters
hereby format         # Format all code
hereby generate       # Generate all Go code (e.g. diagnostics, committed to repo)
```

Additional tasks are a work in progress.

`hereby` is not required to work on the repo; the regular `go` tooling (e.g., `go build`, `go test ./...`) will work as expected.
`hereby` tasks are provided as a convenience for those familiar with the TypeScript repo.

### Running `tsgo`

After running `hereby build`, you can run `built/local/tsgo`, which behaves mostly the same as `tsc`.

### Running LSP Prototype

To debug and run the VS Code extension without installing it globally:

* Run VS Code in the repo workspace (`code .`)
* Copy `.vscode/launch.template.json` to `.vscode/launch.json`
* &lt;kbd&gt;F5&lt;/kbd&gt; (or `Debug: Start Debugging` from the command palette)

This will launch a new VS Code instance which uses the Corsa LS as the backend. If correctly set up, you should see &quot;tsgo&quot; in the status bar when a TypeScript or JavaScript file is open:

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Entry point slightly different for now |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS5.8 |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently (in progress) |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JS Doc | not ready | - |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking |
| Build mode / project references | not ready | - |
| Incremental build | not ready | - |
| Language service (LSP) | prototype | Minimal functionality (errors, hover, go to def). More features coming soon |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.

Traefik (pronounced _traffic_) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.
Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/), [Rancher v2](https://rancher.com), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.
Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the _only_ configuration step you need.

:warning: When migrating to a new major version of Traefik, please refer to the [migration guide](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/migration/v2-to-v3/) to ensure a smooth transition and to be aware of any breaking changes.


## Overview

Imagine that you have deployed a bunch of microservices with the help of an orchestrator (like Swarm or Kubernetes) or a service registry (like etcd or consul).
Now you want users to access these microservices, and you need a reverse proxy.

Traditional reverse-proxies require that you configure _each_ route that will connect paths and subdomains to _each_ microservice. 
In an environment where you add, remove, kill, upgrade, or scale your services _many_ times a day, the task of keeping the routes up to date becomes tedious. 

**This is when Traefik can help you!**

Traefik listens to your service registry/orchestrator API and instantly generates the routes so your microservices are connected to the outside world -- without further intervention from your part. 

**Run Traefik and let it do the work for you!** 
_(But if you&#039;d rather configure some of your routes manually, Traefik supports that too!)_

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step [installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) for our self-hosted [community edition](https://link.photoprism.app/personal-editions) can be found on [docs.photoprism.app](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) - all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The [stable releases](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/) and [development preview](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/updates/#development-preview) are available as a [multi-arch image](https://link.photoprism.app/docker-hub) for 64-bit AMD, Intel, and ARM processors.
That means, [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/) and Apple Silicon users enjoy the exact same functionality and can follow the same [installation steps](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/).

See our [Getting Started FAQ](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-install-photoprism-without-docker) for alternative installation methods, for example using the [*tar.gz* packages](https://dl.photoprism.app/pkg/linux/README.html) we provide.

## Upcoming Features and Enhancements ##

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/photoprism/projects/5&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://dl.photoprism.app/img/ui/2025/upcoming-features-240px.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Our [Project Roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress and what features will be implemented next. You are invited to give ideas you like a thumbs-up, so we know what&#039;s most popular.

Be aware that we have a zero-bug policy and do our best to help users when they need support or have other questions. This comes at a price though, as we can&#039;t give exact release dates for new features. Our team receives many more requests than can be implemented, so we want to emphasize that we are in no way obligated to implement the features, enhancements, or other changes you request. We do, however, appreciate your feedback and carefully consider all requests.

**Because sustained funding is key to quickly releasing new features, we encourage you to support our mission by [signing up for a personal membership](https://link.photoprism.app/membership) or [purchasing a commercial license](https://www.photoprism.app/teams#compare).**

## GitHub Issues ⚠️ ##

We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app. Thank you for your careful consideration!

- When browsing issues, please note that **our team and all issue subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for [discussions, questions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions), or [expressing personal opinions](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct)
- In order for us to investigate [new bug reports](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs), they must include **a complete list of steps to reproduce the problem**, the software versions used and information about the environment in which the problem occurred, such as [browser type, browser version, browser plug-ins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [processor type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu), and [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory)
- [Contact us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives us the opportunity to [improve our documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support instead of dealing with unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by replying to comments

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

## Introduction

The traditional method of providing web interfaces to Go programs is via a built-in web server. Wails offers a different
approach: it provides the ability to wrap both Go code and a web frontend into a single binary. Tools are provided to
make this easy for you by handling project creation, compilation and bundling. All you have to do is get creative!

## Features

- Use standard Go for the backend
- Use any frontend technology you are already familiar with to build your UI
- Quickly create rich frontends for your Go programs using pre-built templates
- Easily call Go methods from Javascript
- Auto-generated Typescript definitions for your Go structs and methods
- Native Dialogs &amp; Menus
- Native Dark / Light mode support
- Supports modern translucency and &quot;frosted window&quot; effects
- Unified eventing system between Go and Javascript
- Powerful cli tool to quickly generate and build your projects
- Multiplatform
- Uses native rendering engines - _no embedded browser_!

### Roadmap

The project roadmap may be found [here](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions/1484). Please consult
it before creating an enhancement request.

## FAQ

- Is this an alternative to Electron?

  Depends on your requirements. It&#039;s designed to make it easy for Go programmers to make lightweight desktop
  applications or add a frontend to their existing applications. Wails does offer native elements such as menus
  and dialogs, so it could be considered a lightweight electron alternative.

- Who is this project aimed at?

  Go programmers who want to bundle an HTML/JS/CSS frontend with their applications, without resorting to creating a
  server and opening a browser to view it.

- What&#039;s with the name?

  When I saw WebView, I thought &quot;What I really want is tooling around building a WebView app, a bit like Rails is to
  Ruby&quot;. So initially it was a play on words (Webview on Rails). It just so happened to also be a homophone of the
  English name for the [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) I am from. So it stuck.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TinyGo - Go compiler for small places

TinyGo is a Go compiler intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (wasm/wasi), and command-line tools.

It reuses libraries used by the [Go language tools](https://golang.org/pkg/go/) alongside [LLVM](http://llvm.org) to provide an alternative way to compile programs written in the Go programming language.

## Embedded

Here is an example program that blinks the built-in LED when run directly on any supported board with onboard LED:

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;machine&quot;
    &quot;time&quot;
)

func main() {
    led := machine.LED
    led.Configure(machine.PinConfig{Mode: machine.PinOutput})
    for {
        led.Low()
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)

        led.High()
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)
    }
}
```

The above program can be compiled and run without modification on an Arduino Uno, an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or any of the supported boards that have a built-in LED, just by setting the correct TinyGo compiler target. For example, this compiles and flashes an Arduino Uno:

```shell
tinygo flash -target arduino examples/blinky1
```

## WebAssembly

TinyGo is very useful for compiling programs both for use in browsers (WASM) as well as for use on servers and other edge devices (WASI).

TinyGo programs can run in [Fastly Compute](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/guides/compute/go/), [Fermyon Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/go-components), [wazero](https://wazero.io/languages/tinygo/) and many other WebAssembly runtimes.

Here is a small TinyGo program for use by a WASI host application:

```go
package main

//go:wasmexport add
func add(x, y uint32) uint32 {
	return x + y
}
```

This compiles the above TinyGo program for use on any WASI Preview 1 runtime:

```shell
tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared -o add.wasm -target=wasip1 add.go
```

You can also use the same syntax as Go 1.24+:

```shell
GOARCH=wasip1 GOOS=wasm tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared -o add.wasm add.go
```

## Installation

## Project Scope

Goals:

* Have very small binary sizes. Don&#039;t pay for what you don&#039;t use.
* Support for most common microcontroller boards.
* Be usable on the web using WebAssembly.
* Good CGo support, with no more overhead than a regular function call.
* Support most standard library packages and compile most Go code without modification.

Non-goals:

* Be efficient while using zillions of goroutines. However, good goroutine support is certainly a goal.
* Be as fast as `gc`. However, LLVM will probably be better at optimizing certain things so TinyGo might actually turn out to be faster for number crunching.
* Be able to compile every Go program out there.

## Why this project exists

&gt; We never expected Go to be an embedded language and so its got serious problems...

-- Rob Pike, [GopherCon 2014 Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoS7DsT1rdM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2799)

TinyGo is a project to bring Go to microcontrollers and small systems with a single processor core. It is similar to [emgo](https://github.com/ziutek/emgo) but a major difference is that we want to keep the Go memory model (which implies garbage collection of some sort). Another difference is that TinyGo uses LLVM internally instead of emitting C, which hopefully leads to smaller and more efficient code and certainly leads to more flexibility.

The original reasoning was: if [Python](https://micropython.org/) can run on microcontrollers, then certainly [Go](https://golang.org/) should be able to run on even lower level micros.

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it&#039;ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don&#039;t need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It&#039;s based on software we use for our public [AdGuard DNS] servers, and both share a lot of code.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison&quot; id=&quot;comparison&quot; name=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparing AdGuard Home to other solutions&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adguard-dns&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot;&gt;How is this different from public AdGuard DNS servers?&lt;/a&gt;

Running your own AdGuard Home server allows you to do much more than using a public DNS server. It&#039;s a completely different level. See for yourself:

- Choose what exactly the server blocks and permits.

- Monitor your network activity.

- Add your own custom filtering rules.

- **Most importantly, it&#039;s your own server, and you are the only one who&#039;s in control.**

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-pi-hole&quot; id=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot; name=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;

At this point, AdGuard Home has a lot in common with Pi-Hole. Both block ads and trackers using the so-called “DNS sinkholing” method and both allow customizing what&#039;s blocked.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We&#039;re not going to stop here. DNS sinkholing is not a bad starting point, but this is just the beginning.

AdGuard Home provides a lot of features out-of-the-box with no need to install and configure additional software. We want it to be simple to the point when even casual users can set it up with minimal effort.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Some of the listed features can be added to Pi-Hole by installing additional software or by manually using SSH terminal and reconfiguring one of the utilities Pi-Hole consists of. However, in our opinion, this cannot be legitimately counted as a Pi-Hole&#039;s feature.

| Feature                                                                 | AdGuard&amp;nbsp;Home | Pi-Hole                                                   |

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adblock&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to traditional ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;

It depends.

DNS sinkholing is capable of blocking a big percentage of ads, but it lacks the flexibility and the power of traditional ad blockers. You can get a good impression about the difference between these methods by reading [this article][blog-adaway], which compares AdGuard for Android (a traditional ad blocker) to hosts-level ad blockers (which are almost identical to DNS-based blockers in their capabilities). This level of protection is enough for some users.

Additionally, using a DNS-based blocker can help to block ads, tracking and analytics requests on other types of devices, such as SmartTVs, smart speakers or other kinds of IoT devices (on which you can&#039;t install traditional ad blockers).

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-limitations&quot; id=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot; name=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot;&gt;Known limitations&lt;/a&gt;

Here are some examples of what cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker:

- YouTube, Twitch ads;

- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram sponsored posts.

Essentially, any advertising that shares a domain with content cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker.

Is there a chance to handle this in the future?  DNS will never be enough to do this. Our only option is to use a content blocking proxy like what we do in the standalone AdGuard applications. We&#039;re [going to bring][issue-1228] this feature support to AdGuard Home in the future. Unfortunately, even in this case, there still will be cases when this won&#039;t be enough or would require quite a complicated configuration.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#how-to-build&quot; id=&quot;how-to-build&quot; name=&quot;how-to-build&quot;&gt;How to build from source&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#prerequisites&quot; id=&quot;prerequisites&quot; name=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make init` to prepare the development environment.

You will need this to build AdGuard Home:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.24 or later;
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v20.19 or later;
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v10.8 or later;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#building&quot; id=&quot;building&quot; name=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt;

Open your terminal and execute these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome
cd AdGuardHome
make
```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The non-standard `-j` flag is currently not supported, so building with `make -j 4` or setting your `MAKEFLAGS` to include, for example, `-j 4` is likely to break the build. If you do have your `MAKEFLAGS` set to that, and you don&#039;t want to change it, you can override it by running `make -j 1`.

Check the [`Makefile`][src-makefile] to learn about other commands.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#building-cross&quot; id=&quot;building-cross&quot; name=&quot;building-cross&quot;&gt;Building for a different platform&lt;/a&gt;

You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports. In order to do this, specify `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables as macros when running `make`.

For example:

```sh
env GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039; make
```

or:

```sh
make GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039;
```

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#preparing-releases&quot; id=&quot;preparing-releases&quot; name=&quot;preparing-releases&quot;&gt;Preparing releases&lt;/a&gt;

You&#039;ll need [`snapcraft`] to prepare a release build. Once installed, run the following command:

```sh
make build-release CHANNEL=&#039;...&#039; VERSION=&#039;...&#039;
```

See the [`build-release` target documentation][targ-release].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#docker-image&quot; id=&quot;docker-image&quot; name=&quot;docker-image&quot;&gt;Docker image&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make build-docker` to build the Docker image locally (the one that we publish to DockerHub). Please note, that we&#039;re using [Docker Buildx][buildx] to build our official image.

You may need to prepare before using these builds:

- (Linux-only) Install Qemu:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes --credential yes
  ```

- Prepare the builder:

  ```sh
  docker buildx create --name buildx-builder --driver docker-container --use
  ```

See the [`build-docker` target documentation][targ-docker].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#debugging-the-frontend&quot; id=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot; name=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot;&gt;Debugging the frontend&lt;/a&gt;

When you need to debug the frontend without recompiling the production version every time, for example to check how your labels would look on a form, you can run the frontend build a development environment.

1. In a separate terminal, run:

   ```sh
   ( cd ./client/ &amp;&amp; env NODE_ENV=&#039;development&#039; npm run watch )
   ```

2. Run your `AdGuardHome` binary with the `--local-frontend` flag, which instructs AdGuard Home to ignore the built-in frontend files and use those from the `./build/` directory.

3. Now any changes you make in the `./client/` directory should be recompiled and become available on the web UI. Make sure that you disable the browser cache to make sure that you actually get the recompiled version.

AdGuard Home uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for E2E testing. Tests are located in `tests/e2e`.

**Running Tests:**
- `npm run test:e2e` – run all tests (headless).
- `npm run test:e2e:interactive` – run tests interactively.
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` – run tests in debug mode.
- `npm run test:e2e:codegen` – generate new test code.

**Setup:**
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npx playwright install` to set up required browsers.

&gt; **Warning:** Playwright will download and install its own browser binaries for testing, which may differ from the browsers installed on your system.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#test-unstable-versions&quot; id=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot; name=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot;&gt;Test unstable versions&lt;/a&gt;

There are two update channels that you can use:

- `beta`: beta versions of AdGuard Home. More or less stable versions, usually released every two weeks or more often.

- `edge`: the newest version of AdGuard Home from the development branch. New updates are pushed to this channel daily.

There are three options how you can install an unstable version:

1. [Snap Store]: look for the `beta` and `edge` channels.

2. [Docker Hub]: look for the `beta` and `edge` tags.

3. Standalone builds. Use the automated installation script or look for the available builds [on the Wiki][wiki-platf].

   Script to install a beta version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c beta
   ```

   Script to install an edge version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c edge
   ```

Dgraph is a horizontally scalable and distributed GraphQL database with a graph backend. It provides
ACID transactions, consistent replication, and linearizable reads. It&#039;s built from the ground up to
perform a rich set of queries. Being a native GraphQL database, it tightly controls how the data is
arranged on disk to optimize for query performance and throughput, reducing disk seeks and network
calls in a cluster.

Dgraph&#039;s goal is to provide Google production-level scale and throughput, with low enough latency to
serve real-time user queries over terabytes of structured data. Dgraph supports
[GraphQL query syntax](https://docs.hypermode.com/dgraph/graphql/overview), and responds in
[JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
over [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) and HTTP. Dgraph is written using the Go Programming Language.

## Status

Dgraph is at [version v24.1.3][rel] and is production-ready. Apart from the vast open source
community, it is being used in production at multiple Fortune 500 companies, and by
[Intuit Katlas](https://github.com/intuit/katlas) and
[VMware Purser](https://github.com/vmware/purser). A hosted version of Dgraph is available at
[https://cloud.dgraph.io](https://cloud.dgraph.io).

[rel]: https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/releases/tag/v24.1.3

## Supported Platforms

Dgraph officially supports the Linux/amd64 architecture. Support for Linux/arm64 is in development.
In order to take advantage of memory performance gains and other architecture-specific advancements
in Linux, we dropped official support Mac and Windows in 2021, see
[this blog post](https://discuss.hypermode.com/t/dropping-support-for-windows-and-mac/12913) for more
information. You can still build and use Dgraph on other platforms (for live or bulk loading for
instance), but support for platforms other than Linux/amd64 is not available.

Running Dgraph in a Docker environment is the recommended testing and deployment method.

## Install with Docker

If you&#039;re using Docker, you can use the
[official Dgraph image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgraph/dgraph/).

```bash
docker pull dgraph/dgraph:latest
```

For more information on a variety Docker deployment methods including Docker Compose and Kubernetes,
see the [docs](https://docs.hypermode.com/dgraph/self-managed/overview).

## Run a Quick Standalone Cluster

```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -v ~/dgraph:/dgraph dgraph/standalone:latest
```

## Install from Source

If you want to install from source, install Go 1.19+ or later and the following dependencies:

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### Build and Install

Then clone the Dgraph repository and use `make install` to install the Dgraph binary in the
directory named by the GOBIN environment variable, which defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if
the GOPATH environment variable is not set.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph.git
cd dgraph
make install
```

## Get Started

**To get started with Dgraph, follow:**

- [Installation to queries in 3 steps](https://docs.hypermode.com/dgraph/quickstart).
- Tutorial and presentation videos on
  [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghE41LR8nkKFlR3IFTRO4w/featured).

## Is Dgraph the right choice for me?

- Do you have more than 10 SQL tables connected via foreign keys?
- Do you have sparse data, which doesn&#039;t elegantly fit into SQL tables?
- Do you want a simple and flexible schema, which is readable and maintainable over time?
- Do you care about speed and performance at scale?

If the answers to the above are YES, then Dgraph would be a great fit for your application. Dgraph
provides NoSQL like scalability while providing SQL like transactions and the ability to select,
filter, and aggregate data points. It combines that with distributed joins, traversals, and graph
operations, which makes it easy to build applications with it.
