## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don&#039;t need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Method 1: Using Make commands (Recommended)
make dev-start      # Start infrastructure
make dev-app        # Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend (new terminal)

# Method 2: One-click start
./scripts/quick-dev.sh

# Method 3: Using scripts
./scripts/dev.sh start     # Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev.sh app       # Start backend (new terminal)
./scripts/dev.sh frontend  # Start frontend (new terminal)
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging

## Why Kaiju?
The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at around 5,400 FPS on the same machine. In fact, a complete game, with audio, custom cursors, real time PBR rendering with real time shadows, UI, and more runs at 2,712 FPS (in &quot;debug&quot; mode) [screenshots or it didn&#039;t happen](https://x.com/ShieldCrush/status/1943516032674537958).

## Why Go (golang)?
I love C, and because I love C and found out that Ken Thompson played a part in designing Go, I gave Go a chance. It has been such a joy to use and work with I decided to port my C game engine to Go. Go is a modern system-level language that allows me to write code the way I want to write code and even have the opportunity to do some crazy things if I want to (no strings attached). Also the simplicity and &quot;just works&quot; of writing Assembly code was a great boost to my happiness.

What&#039;s more, it&#039;s a language that other developers can easily learn and jump right into extending the engine/editor. No need for developers to re-figure out some bespoke macros or crazy templating nonsense. It&#039;s flat, easy, straight forward, and the foot-gun is hidden behind some walls, but there if you want it. Furthermore, developers can write their games in Go directly, no need for some alternative language that is different from the engine code (but we&#039;ll include Lua for modding).

## What about the Garbage Collector?!
I am creating this section because I get asked about it when I mention &quot;Go&quot;, possibly not realizing that most public game engines use a garbage collector (GC).

The GC is actually a feature I&#039;m happy with (shocker coming from a C guy). Well, the reason is simple, if you&#039;re going to make a game engine that the public will use and needs to be stable, you need a garbage collector. Unity has C# (and possibly an internal GC as well), Unreal has a GC (and it could use a tune up if you ask me), Godot has a GC albeit their scripting language or when you use C#. It is actually very important for public engines to have a GC because people are only human and make a lot of mistakes, mistakes they&#039;ll blame on you (the engine developer) before they blame themselves.

Coincidentally, the overall design I have for the engine plays very well with the GC and last I measured, I have a net-0 heap allocation while running (may need a new review). If you don&#039;t abuse the GC, you shouldn&#039;t generally feel it, it runs concurrently as well.

I&#039;ll be the first to admit, I think the developers of Go can create a better GC than I can, and probably better than Unreal and Unity too.

## ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️
Though the engine is production ready, the editor **_is not_**, feel free to join and contribute to its development.

For the latest updates, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYj7Dh7ke3) or check my [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/ShieldCrush).

Please review the Ad-Hoc [editor readme](https://github.com/KaijuEngine/kaiju/blob/master/src/editor/README.md)

## Compiling the engine
&gt; **Windows developers must install the 64-bit Go toolchain (`windows-amd64`).**
&gt; The 32-bit (`windows-386`) Go distribution will not compile Kaiju’s Vulkan backend.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;你的新编程伙伴，现在就在你最爱的终端中。&lt;br /&gt;你的工具、代码和工作流，都与您选择的 LLM 模型紧密相连。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;Crush Demo&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58280caf-851b-470a-b6f7-d5c4ea8a1968&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

## Features

- **Multi-Model:** choose from a wide range of LLMs or add your own via OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible APIs
- **Flexible:** switch LLMs mid-session while preserving context
- **Session-Based:** maintain multiple work sessions and contexts per project
- **LSP-Enhanced:** Crush uses LSPs for additional context, just like you do
- **Extensible:** add capabilities via MCPs (`http`, `stdio`, and `sse`)
- **Works Everywhere:** first-class support in every terminal on macOS, Linux, Windows (PowerShell and WSL), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD

## Installation

Use a package manager:

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install charmbracelet/tap/crush

# NPM
npm install -g @charmland/crush

# Arch Linux (btw)
yay -S crush-bin

# Nix
nix run github:numtide/nix-ai-tools#crush
```

Windows users:

```bash
# Winget
winget install charmbracelet.crush

# Scoop
scoop bucket add charm https://github.com/charmbracelet/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install crush
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nix (NUR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Crush is available via [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) in `nur.repos.charmbracelet.crush`.

You can also try out Crush via `nix-shell`:

```bash
# Add the NUR channel.
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/main.tar.gz nur
nix-channel --update

# Get Crush in a Nix shell.
nix-shell -p &#039;(import &lt;nur&gt; { pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}; }).repos.charmbracelet.crush&#039;
```

### NixOS &amp; Home Manager Module Usage via NUR

Crush provides NixOS and Home Manager modules via NUR.
You can use these modules directly in your flake by importing them from NUR. Since it auto detects whether its a home manager or nixos context you can use the import the exact same way :)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nur.url = &quot;github:nix-community/NUR&quot;;
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nur, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
      modules = [
        nur.modules.nixos.default
        nur.repos.charmbracelet.modules.crush
        {
          programs.crush = {
            enable = true;
            settings = {
              providers = {
                openai = {
                  id = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  name = &quot;OpenAI&quot;;
                  base_url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1&quot;;
                  type = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  api_key = &quot;sk-fake123456789abcdef...&quot;;
                  models = [
                    {
                      id = &quot;gpt-4&quot;;
                      name = &quot;GPT-4&quot;;
                    }
                  ];
                };
              };
              lsp = {
                go = { command = &quot;gopls&quot;; enabled = true; };
                nix = { command = &quot;nil&quot;; enabled = true; };
              };
              options = {
                context_paths = [ &quot;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&quot; ];
                tui = { compact_mode = true; };
                debug = false;
              };
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora/RHEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
echo &#039;[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key&#039; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

Or, download it:

- [Packages][releases] are available in Debian and RPM formats
- [Binaries][releases] are available for Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD

[releases]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/releases

Or just install it with Go:

```
go install github.com/charmbracelet/crush@latest
```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Productivity may increase when using Crush and you may find yourself nerd
&gt; sniped when first using the application. If the symptoms persist, join the
&gt; [Discord][discord] and nerd snipe the rest of us.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, or OpenRouter and just start
Crush. You&#039;ll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

| Environment Variable        | Provider                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`         | Anthropic                                          |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`            | OpenAI                                             |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`        | OpenRouter                                         |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`            | Google Gemini                                      |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`          | Cerebras                                           |
| `HF_TOKEN`                  | Huggingface Inference                              |
| `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`          | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `VERTEXAI_LOCATION`         | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`              | Groq                                               |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`         | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`     | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_REGION`                | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_PROFILE`               | Amazon Bedrock (Custom Profile)                       |
| `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`  | Amazon Bedrock                                        |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI models                                |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`      | Azure OpenAI models (optional when using Entra ID) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`  | Azure OpenAI models                                |

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Catwalk Badge&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  &quot;this-setting&quot;: { &quot;this&quot;: &quot;that&quot; },
  &quot;that-setting&quot;: [&quot;ceci&quot;, &quot;cela&quot;]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;lsp&quot;: {
    &quot;go&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gopls&quot;,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GOTOOLCHAIN&quot;: &quot;go1.24.5&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;typescript&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;typescript-language-server&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;--stdio&quot;]
    },
    &quot;nix&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nil&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/mcp-server.js&quot;],
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [&quot;some-tool-name&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NODE_ENV&quot;: &quot;production&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [&quot;create_issue&quot;, &quot;create_pull_request&quot;],
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer $GH_PAT&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;streaming-service&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/sse&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;API-Key&quot;: &quot;$(echo $API_KEY)&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don&#039;t want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you&#039;d like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allowed_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;view&quot;,
      &quot;ls&quot;,
      &quot;grep&quot;,
      &quot;edit&quot;,
      &quot;mcp_context7_get-library-doc&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Disabling Built-In Tools

If you&#039;d like to prevent Crush from using certain built-in tools entirely, you
can disable them via the `options.disabled_tools` list. Disabled tools are
completely hidden from the agent.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;bash&quot;,
      &quot;sourcegraph&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

To disable tools from MCP servers, see the [MCP config section](#mcps).

### Initialization

When you initialize a project, Crush analyzes your codebase and creates
a context file that helps it work more effectively in future sessions.
By default, this file is named `AGENTS.md`, but you can customize the
name and location with the `initialize_as` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;initialize_as&quot;: &quot;AGENTS.md&quot;
  }
}
```

This is useful if you prefer a different naming convention or want to
place the file in a specific directory (e.g., `CRUSH.md` or
`docs/LLMs.md`). Crush will fill the file with project-specific context
like build commands, code patterns, and conventions it discovered during
initialization.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;attribution&quot;: {
      &quot;trailer_style&quot;: &quot;co-authored-by&quot;,
      &quot;generated_with&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

- `trailer_style`: Controls the attribution trailer added to commit messages
  (default: `assisted-by`)
	- `assisted-by`: Adds `Assisted-by: [Model Name] via Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	  (includes the model name)
	- `co-authored-by`: Adds `Co-Authored-By: Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	- `none`: No attribution trailer
- `generated_with`: When true (default), adds `💘 Generated with Crush` line to
  commit messages and PR descriptions

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Note that we support two &quot;types&quot; for OpenAI. Make sure to choose the right one
&gt; to ensure the best experience!
&gt; * `openai` should be used when proxying or routing requests through OpenAI.
&gt; * `openai-compat` should be used when using non-OpenAI providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don&#039;t forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;deepseek&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deepseek V3&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 0.27,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 0.07,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 64000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;custom-anthropic&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anthropic&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.anthropic.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;extra_headers&quot;: {
        &quot;anthropic-version&quot;: &quot;2023-06-01&quot;
      },
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Claude Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`
- Alternatively to `aws configure`, you can also just set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;vertexai&quot;: {
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4@20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VertexAI Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;ollama&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ollama&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen3:30b&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;lmstudio&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;LM Studio&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:1234/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;debug&quot;: true,
    &quot;debug_lsp&quot;: true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_provider_auto_update&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
crush update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
crush update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at crush at build time.
crush update-providers embedded

# For more info:
crush update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Crush records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code ([here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/blob/main/internal/llm/agent/event.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Or by setting the following in your config:

```json
{
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_metrics&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Crush also respects the [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://consoledonottrack.com)
convention which can be enabled via `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

&gt;*The modern internet built on public clouds is increasingly threatening your personal data privacy. As reliance on services like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Facebook grows, so does the risk to your digital autonomy. Your data lives on their servers, subject to their terms, tracking, and potential censorship.*
&gt;
&gt;*It&#039;s time for a change.* 

![Personal Cloud](https://app.cdn.olares.com/github/olares/public-cloud-to-personal-cloud.jpg)
We believe you have a fundamental right to control your digital life. The most effective way to uphold this right is by hosting your data locally, on your own hardware.

Olares is an **open-source personal cloud operating system** designed to empower you to own and manage your digital assets locally. Instead of relying on public cloud services, you can deploy powerful open-source alternatives locally on Olares, such as Ollama for hosting LLMs, ComfyUI for image generation, and Perplexica for private, AI-driven search and reasoning. Imagine the power of the cloud, but with you in complete command.

## Development Status

**2025-10-24 update**: The Registry API has entered an **API freeze (v0.1)** 🎉. For the next month or more, the API will remain stable with no breaking changes, allowing integrators to confidently implement support. This freeze applies to v0.1 while development continues on v0. We&#039;ll use this period to validate the API in real-world integrations and gather feedback to shape v1 for general availability. Thank you to everyone for your contributions and patience—your involvement has been key to getting us here!

**2025-09-08 update**: The registry has launched in preview 🎉 ([announcement blog post](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-09-08-mcp-registry-preview/)). While the system is now more stable, this is still a preview release and breaking changes or data resets may occur. A general availability (GA) release will follow later. We&#039;d love your feedback in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/discussions/new?category=ideas) or in the [#registry-dev Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1358869848138059966/1369487942862504016) ([joining details here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication)).

- **[Pull Requests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/pulls)** - Contribute work towards issues

### Quick start:

#### Pre-requisites

- **Docker**
- **Go 1.24.x**
- **ko** - Container image builder for Go ([installation instructions](https://ko.build/install/))
- **golangci-lint v2.4.0**

#### Running the server

```bash
# Start full development environment
make dev-compose
```

This starts the registry at [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) with PostgreSQL. The database uses ephemeral storage and is reset each time you restart the containers, ensuring a clean state for development and testing.

**Note:** The registry uses [ko](https://ko.build) to build container images. The `make dev-compose` command automatically builds the registry image with ko and loads it into your local Docker daemon before starting the services.

By default, the registry seeds from the production API with a filtered subset of servers (to keep startup fast). This ensures your local environment mirrors production behavior and all seed data passes validation. For offline development you can seed from a file without validation with `MCP_REGISTRY_SEED_FROM=data/seed.json MCP_REGISTRY_ENABLE_REGISTRY_VALIDATION=false make dev-compose`.

The setup can be configured with environment variables in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) - see [.env.example](./.env.example) for a reference.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Alternative: Running a pre-built Docker image&lt;/summary&gt;

Pre-built Docker images are automatically published to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Run latest stable release
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:latest

# Run latest from main branch (continuous deployment)
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:main

# Run specific release version
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:v1.0.0

# Run development build from main branch
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:main-20250906-abc123d
```

**Available tags:** 
- **Releases**: `latest`, `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.
- **Continuous**: `main` (latest main branch build)
- **Development**: `main-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;sha&gt;` (specific commit builds)

&lt;/details&gt;

#### Publishing a server

To publish a server, we&#039;ve built a simple CLI. You can use it with:

```bash
# Build the latest CLI
make publisher

# Use it!
./bin/mcp-publisher --help
```

See [the publisher guide](./docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/quickstart.mdx) for more details.

#### Other commands

```bash
# Run lint, unit tests and integration tests
make check
```

There are also a few more helpful commands for development. Run `make help` to learn more, or look in [Makefile](./Makefile).

&lt;!--
For Claude and other AI tools: Always prefer make targets over custom commands where possible.

### Authentication

Publishing supports multiple authentication methods:
- **GitHub OAuth** - For publishing by logging into GitHub
- **GitHub OIDC** - For publishing from GitHub Actions
- **DNS verification** - For proving ownership of a domain and its subdomains
- **HTTP verification** - For proving ownership of a domain

The registry validates namespace ownership when publishing. E.g. to publish...:
- `io.github.domdomegg/my-cool-mcp` you must login to GitHub as `domdomegg`, or be in a GitHub Action on domdomegg&#039;s repos
- `me.adamjones/my-cool-mcp` you must prove ownership of `adamjones.me` via DNS or HTTP challenge

[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/?ref=github-inngest-readme)&#039;s durable functions replace queues, state management, and scheduling to enable any developer to write reliable step functions faster without touching infrastructure.

1. Write durable functions using any of [**our language SDKs**](#sdks)
2. Run the [**Inngest Dev Server**](#getting-started) for a complete local development experience, with production parity.
3. Deploy your functions to your own infrastructure
4. Sync your application&#039;s functions with the [**Inngest Platform**](https://www.inngest.com/?ref=github-inngest-readme) or a [self-hosted Inngest server](#self-hosting).
5. Inngest invokes your functions securely via HTTPS whenever triggering events are received.

### An example durable function

Inngest Functions enable developers to run reliable background logic, from background jobs to complex workflows. An Inngest Function is composed of three key parts that provide robust support for retrying, scheduling, and coordinating complex sequences of operations:

- [**Triggers**](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Events, Cron schedules or webhook events that trigger the function.
- [**Flow Control**](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Configure how the function runs are enqueued and executed including concurrency, throttling, debouncing, rate limiting, and prioritization.
- [**Steps**](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Steps are fundamental building blocks of Inngest, turning your Inngest Functions into reliable workflows that can runs for months and recover from failures.

Here is an example function that limits concurrency for each unique user id and performs two steps that will be retried on error:

```typescript
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: &quot;import-product-images&quot;,
    concurrency: {
      key: &quot;event.data.userId&quot;,
      limit: 10
    }
  },
  { event: &quot;shop/product.imported&quot; },
  async ({ event, step }) =&gt; {
    // Here goes the business logic
    // By wrapping code in steps, each will be retried automatically on failure
    const s3Urls = await step.run(&quot;copy-images-to-s3&quot;, async () =&gt; {
      return copyAllImagesToS3(event.data.imageURLs);
    });
    // You can include numerous steps in your function
    await step.run(&quot;resize-images&quot;, async () =&gt; {
      await resizer.bulk({ urls: s3Urls, quality: 0.9, maxWidth: 1024 });
    })
  };
);

// Elsewhere in your code (e.g. in your API endpoint):
await inngest.send({
  name: &quot;shop/product.imported&quot;,
  data: {
    userId: &quot;01J8G44701QYGE0DH65PZM8DPM&quot;,
    imageURLs: [
      &quot;https://useruploads.acme.com/q2345678/1094.jpg&quot;,
      &quot;https://useruploads.acme.com/q2345678/1095.jpg&quot;
    ],
  },
});
```

## Project Architecture

To understand how self-hosting works, it&#039;s valuable to understand the architecture and system components at a high level. We&#039;ll take a look at a simplified architecture diagram and walk through the system.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/architecture-2024-09-23.png&quot; alt=&quot;System Architecture&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- **Event API** - Receives events from SDKs via HTTP requests. Authenticates client requests via [Event Keys](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events/creating-an-event-key?ref=github-inngest-readme). The Event API publishes event payloads to an internal event stream.
- **Event stream** - Acts as buffer between the _Event API_ and the _Runner_.
- **Runner** - Consumes incoming events and performs several actions:
  - Scheduling of new “function runs” (aka jobs) given the event type, creating initial run state in the _State store_ database. Runs are added to queues given the function&#039;s flow control configuration.
  - Resume functions paused via [`waitForEvent`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/wait-for-event?ref=github-inngest-readme) with matching expressions.
  - Cancels running functions with matching [`cancelOn`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancellation/cancel-on-events?ref=github-inngest-readme) expressions
  - Writes ingested events to a database for historical record and future replay.
- **Queue** - A multi-tenant aware, multi-tier queue designed for fairness and various [flow control](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control?ref=github-inngest-readme) methods (concurrency, throttling, prioritization, debouncing, rate limiting) and [batching](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/batching?ref=github-inngest-readme).
- **Executor** - Responsible for executing functions, from initial execution, step execution, writing incremental function run state to the _State store_, and retries after failures.
- **State store (database)** - Persists data for pending and ongoing function runs. Data includes initial triggering event(s), step output and step errors.
- **Database** - Persists system data and history including Apps, Functions, Events, Function run results.
- **API** - GraphQL and REST APIs for programmatic access and management of system resources.
- **Dashboard UI** - The UI to manage apps, functions and view function run history.

Syft development is sponsored by [Anchore](https://anchore.com/), and is released under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file). For commercial support options with Syft or Grype, please [contact Anchore](https://get.anchore.com/contact/).

## Features
- Generates SBOMs for container images, filesystems, archives, and more to discover packages and libraries
- Supports OCI, Docker and [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) image formats
- Linux distribution identification
- Works seamlessly with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) (a fast, modern vulnerability scanner)
- Able to create signed SBOM attestations using the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md)
- Convert between SBOM formats, such as CycloneDX, SPDX, and Syft&#039;s own format.

## Installation

Syft binaries are provided for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Recommended
&gt; ```bash
&gt; curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/syft | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
&gt; ```

Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Homebrew
```bash
brew install syft
```

### Scoop

```powershell
scoop install syft
```

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of Syft is community-maintained and not distributed by the Anchore team

```powershell
choco install syft -y
```

### Nix

**Note**: Nix packaging of Syft is [community maintained](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/sy/syft/package.nix). Syft is available in the [stable channel](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_channels#The_official_channels) since NixOS `22.05`.

```bash
nix-env -i syft
```

... or, just try it out in an ephemeral nix shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p syft
```

## Getting started

### SBOM

To generate an SBOM for a container image:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt;
```

The above output includes only software that is visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the SBOM, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

### Output formats

The output format for Syft is configurable as well using the `-o` (or `--output`) option:

```
syft &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the `formats` available are:
- `syft-json`: Use this to get as much information out of Syft as possible!
- `syft-text`: A row-oriented, human-and-machine-friendly output.
- `cyclonedx-xml`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-xml@1.5`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json@1.5`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `spdx-tag-value`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/).
- `spdx-tag-value@2.2`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.2.2/).
- `spdx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.3/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `spdx-json@2.2`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.2/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `github-json`: A JSON report conforming to GitHub&#039;s dependency snapshot format.
- `syft-table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](https://github.com/anchore/syft/wiki/using-templates) below.

# Overview [![push](https://github.com/nektos/act/workflows/push/badge.svg?branch=master&amp;event=push)](https://github.com/nektos/act/actions) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/nektos/act)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/nektos/act) [![awesome-runners](https://img.shields.io/badge/listed%20on-awesome--runners-blue.svg)](https://github.com/jonico/awesome-runners)

&gt; &quot;Think globally, `act` locally&quot;

Run your [GitHub Actions](https://developer.github.com/actions/) locally! Why would you want to do this? Two reasons:

- **Fast Feedback** - Rather than having to commit/push every time you want to test out the changes you are making to your `.github/workflows/` files (or for any changes to embedded GitHub actions), you can use `act` to run the actions locally. The [environment variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables) and [filesystem](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#filesystems-on-github-hosted-runners) are all configured to match what GitHub provides.
- **Local Task Runner** - I love [make](&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)&gt;). However, I also hate repeating myself. With `act`, you can use the GitHub Actions defined in your `.github/workflows/` to replace your `Makefile`!

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **Now Manage and Run Act Directly From VS Code!**&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Check out the [GitHub Local Actions](https://sanjulaganepola.github.io/github-local-actions-docs/) Visual Studio Code extension which allows you to leverage the power of `act` to run and test workflows locally without leaving your editor.

# How Does It Work?

When you run `act` it reads in your GitHub Actions from `.github/workflows/` and determines the set of actions that need to be run. It uses the Docker API to either pull or build the necessary images, as defined in your workflow files and finally determines the execution path based on the dependencies that were defined. Once it has the execution path, it then uses the Docker API to run containers for each action based on the images prepared earlier. The [environment variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables) and [filesystem](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#file-systems) are all configured to match what GitHub provides.

Let&#039;s see it in action with a [sample repo](https://github.com/cplee/github-actions-demo)!

## Remote GitHub MCP Server

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&amp;logo=visualstudiocode&amp;logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&amp;config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&amp;logo=visualstudiocode&amp;logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&amp;config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D&amp;quality=insiders)

The remote GitHub MCP Server is hosted by GitHub and provides the easiest method for getting up and running. If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don&#039;t worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.

### Prerequisites

1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)

### Install in VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you&#039;re using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.

Alternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Using OAuth&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Using a GitHub PAT&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=left colspan=2&gt;VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```json
{
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```json
{
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}&quot;
      }
    }
  },
  &quot;inputs&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;github_mcp_pat&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;GitHub Personal Access Token&quot;,
      &quot;password&quot;: true
    }
  ]
}
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

### Install in other MCP hosts
- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot
- **[Claude Applications](/docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Web, Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI
- **[Cursor](/docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE
- **[Windsurf](/docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE

&gt; **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application&#039;s documentation for more info.

### Configuration

#### Toolset configuration

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

#### GitHub Enterprise

##### GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.

Example for `https://octocorp.ghe.com` with GitHub PAT token:
```
{
    ...
    &quot;proxima-github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp&quot;,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}&quot;
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

&gt; **Note:** When using OAuth with GitHub Enterprise with VS Code and GitHub Copilot, you also need to configure your VS Code settings to point to your GitHub Enterprise instance - see [Authenticate from VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/authenticate-to-ghecom)

##### GitHub Enterprise Server

GitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.

### Prerequisites

1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.
3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
The MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handling PATs Securely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

### Environment Variables (Recommended)
To keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:

1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Protect your `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
   echo &quot;.env&quot; &gt;&gt; .gitignore
   ```

3. **Reference the token in configurations**
   ```bash
   # CLI usage
   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT

   # In config files (where supported)
   &quot;env&quot;: {
     &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;$GITHUB_PAT&quot;
   }
   ```

&gt; **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.

### Token Security Best Practices

- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions
  - `repo` - Repository operations
  - `read:packages` - Docker image access
  - `read:org` - Organization team access
- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments
- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically
- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control
- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json
  ```

&lt;/details&gt;

### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

The flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set
the hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.

- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.
- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.

    &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
    &quot;args&quot;: [
    &quot;run&quot;,
    &quot;-i&quot;,
    &quot;--rm&quot;,
    &quot;-e&quot;,

    ],
    &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;${input:github_token}&quot;,
        &quot;GITHUB_HOST&quot;: &quot;https://&lt;your GHES or ghe.com domain name&gt;&quot;
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.

More about using MCP server tools in VS Code&#039;s [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

Install in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)

Add the following JSON block to your IDE&#039;s MCP settings.

```json
{
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;inputs&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;github_token&quot;,
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;GitHub Personal Access Token&quot;,
        &quot;password&quot;: true
      }
    ],
    &quot;servers&quot;: {
      &quot;github&quot;: {
        &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [
          &quot;run&quot;,
          &quot;-i&quot;,
          &quot;--rm&quot;,
          &quot;-e&quot;,
          &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,
          &quot;ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server&quot;
        ],
        &quot;env&quot;: {
          &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;${input:github_token}&quot;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example JSON block without the MCP key included&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```json
{
  &quot;inputs&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;github_token&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;GitHub Personal Access Token&quot;,
      &quot;password&quot;: true
    }
  ],
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,
        &quot;ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;${input:github_token}&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Install in Other MCP Hosts

For other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:

- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot
- **[Claude Code &amp; Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop
- **[Cursor](docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE
- **[Google Gemini CLI](docs/installation-guides/install-gemini-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Google Gemini CLI
- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE

For a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.

&gt; **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application&#039;s documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.

### Build from source

If you don&#039;t have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the
`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:

```JSON
{
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;servers&quot;: {
      &quot;github&quot;: {
        &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/github-mcp-server&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;stdio&quot;],
        &quot;env&quot;: {
          &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;&quot;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool Configuration

The GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.

_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

&gt; **Looking for examples?** See the [Server Configuration Guide](./docs/server-configuration.md) for common recipes like minimal setups, read-only mode, and combining tools with toolsets.

#### Specifying Toolsets

To specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLSETS=&quot;repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security&quot; ./github-mcp-server
   ```

The environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.

#### Specifying Individual Tools

You can also configure specific tools using the `--tools` flag. Tools can be used independently or combined with toolsets and dynamic toolsets discovery for fine-grained control.

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLS=&quot;get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request&quot; ./github-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Combining with Toolsets** (additive):
   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues --tools get_gist
   ```
   This registers all tools from `repos` and `issues` toolsets, plus `get_gist`.

4. **Combining with Dynamic Toolsets** (additive):
   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents --dynamic-toolsets
   ```
   This registers `get_file_contents` plus the dynamic toolset tools (`enable_toolset`, `list_available_toolsets`, `get_toolset_tools`).

**Important Notes:**
- Tools, toolsets, and dynamic toolsets can all be used together
- Read-only mode takes priority: write tools are skipped if `--read-only` is set, even if explicitly requested via `--tools`
- Tool names must match exactly (e.g., `get_file_contents`, not `getFileContents`). Invalid tool names will cause the server to fail at startup with an error message

### Using Toolsets With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=&lt;your-token&gt; \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=&quot;repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security,experiments&quot; \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Using Tools With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass specific tools as environment variables. You can also combine tools with toolsets:

```bash
# Tools only
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=&lt;your-token&gt; \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLS=&quot;get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request&quot; \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server

# Tools combined with toolsets (additive)
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=&lt;your-token&gt; \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=&quot;repos,issues&quot; \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLS=&quot;get_gist&quot; \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Special toolsets

#### &quot;all&quot; toolset

The special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:

```bash
./github-mcp-server --toolsets all
```

Or using the environment variable:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS=&quot;all&quot; ./github-mcp-server
```

#### &quot;default&quot; toolset
The default toolset `default` is the configuration that gets passed to the server if no toolsets are specified.

The default configuration is:
- context
- repos
- issues
- pull_requests
- users

To keep the default configuration and add additional toolsets:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS=&quot;default,stargazers&quot; ./github-mcp-server
```

### Available Toolsets

The following sets of tools are available:

&lt;!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS --&gt;
| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## Learn more

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

### 1.2 贡献指南
Hi! 首先感谢你使用 gin-vue-admin。

Gin-vue-admin 是一套为快速研发准备的一整套前后端分离架构式的开源框架，旨在快速搭建中小型项目。

Gin-vue-admin 的成长离不开大家的支持，如果你愿意为 gin-vue-admin 贡献代码或提供建议，请阅读以下内容。

#### 1.2.1 Issue 规范
- issue 仅用于提交 Bug 或 Feature 以及设计相关的内容，其它内容可能会被直接关闭。
									      
- 在提交 issue 之前，请搜索相关内容是否已被提出。

#### 1.2.2 Pull Request 规范
- 请先 fork 一份到自己的项目下，不要直接在仓库下建分支。

- commit 信息要以`[文件名]: 描述信息` 的形式填写，例如 `README.md: fix xxx bug`。

- 如果是修复 bug，请在 PR 中给出描述信息。

- 合并代码需要两名维护人员参与：一人进行 review 后 approve，另一人再次 review，通过后即可合并。

## 2. 使用说明

```
- node版本 &gt; v18.16.0
- golang版本 &gt;= v1.22
- IDE推荐：Goland
```

### 2.1 server项目

使用 `Goland` 等编辑工具，打开server目录，不可以打开 gin-vue-admin 根目录

```bash

# 克隆项目
git clone https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin.git
# 进入server文件夹
cd server

# 使用 go mod 并安装go依赖包
go generate

# 运行
go run . 

```

### 2.2 web项目

```bash
# 进入web文件夹
cd web

# 安装依赖
npm install

# 启动web项目
npm run serve
```

### 2.3 swagger自动化API文档

#### 2.3.1 安装 swagger

``` shell
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

#### 2.3.2 生成API文档

```` shell
cd server
swag init
````

&gt; 执行上面的命令后，server目录下会出现docs文件夹里的 `docs.go`, `swagger.json`, `swagger.yaml` 三个文件更新，启动go服务之后, 在浏览器输入 [http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html) 即可查看swagger文档

### 2.4 VSCode工作区

#### 2.4.1 开发

使用`VSCode`打开根目录下的工作区文件`gin-vue-admin.code-workspace`，在边栏可以看到三个虚拟目录：`backend`、`frontend`、`root`。

#### 2.4.2 运行/调试

在运行和调试中也可以看到三个task：`Backend`、`Frontend`、`Both (Backend &amp; Frontend)`。运行`Both (Backend &amp; Frontend)`可以同时启动前后端项目。

#### 2.4.3 settings

在工作区配置文件中有`go.toolsEnvVars`字段，是用于`VSCode`自身的go工具环境变量。此外在多go版本的系统中，可以通过`gopath`、`go.goroot`指定运行版本。

```json
    &quot;go.gopath&quot;: null,
    &quot;go.goroot&quot;: null,
```

## 3. 技术选型

- 前端：用基于 [Vue](https://vuejs.org) 的 [Element](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element) 构建基础页面。
- 后端：用 [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) 快速搭建基础restful风格API，[Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) 是一个go语言编写的Web框架。
- 数据库：采用`MySql` &gt; (5.7) 版本 数据库引擎 InnoDB，使用 [gorm](http://gorm.cn) 实现对数据库的基本操作。
- 缓存：使用`Redis`实现记录当前活跃用户的`jwt`令牌并实现多点登录限制。
- API文档：使用`Swagger`构建自动化文档。
- 配置文件：使用 [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) 和 [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) 实现`yaml`格式的配置文件。
- 日志：使用 [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) 实现日志记录。

## 5. 主要功能

- 权限管理：基于`jwt`和`casbin`实现的权限管理。
- 文件上传下载：实现基于`七牛云`, `阿里云`, `腾讯云` 的文件上传操作(请开发自己去各个平台的申请对应 `token` 或者对应`key`)。
- 分页封装：前端使用 `mixins` 封装分页，分页方法调用 `mixins` 即可。
- 用户管理：系统管理员分配用户角色和角色权限。
- 角色管理：创建权限控制的主要对象，可以给角色分配不同api权限和菜单权限。
- 菜单管理：实现用户动态菜单配置，实现不同角色不同菜单。
- api管理：不同用户可调用的api接口的权限不同。
- 配置管理：配置文件可前台修改(在线体验站点不开放此功能)。
- 条件搜索：增加条件搜索示例。
- restful示例：可以参考用户管理模块中的示例API。
	- 前端文件参考: [web/src/view/superAdmin/api/api.vue](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/master/web/src/view/superAdmin/api/api.vue)
    - 后台文件参考: [server/router/sys_api.go](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/master/server/router/sys_api.go)
- 多点登录限制：需要在`config.yaml`中把`system`中的`use-multipoint`修改为true(需要自行配置Redis和Config中的Redis参数，测试阶段，有bug请及时反馈)。
- 分片上传：提供文件分片上传和大文件分片上传功能示例。
- 表单生成器：表单生成器借助 [@Variant Form](https://github.com/vform666/variant-form) 。
- 代码生成器：后台基础逻辑以及简单curd的代码生成器。

# PostgreSQL Server Exporter

Prometheus exporter for PostgreSQL server metrics.

CI Tested PostgreSQL versions: `13`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`.

## Quick Start
This package is available for Docker:
```
# Start an example database
docker run --net=host -it --rm -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
# Connect to it
docker run \
  --net=host \
  -e DATA_SOURCE_URI=&quot;localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable&quot; \
  -e DATA_SOURCE_USER=postgres \
  -e DATA_SOURCE_PASS=password \
  quay.io/prometheuscommunity/postgres-exporter
```

Test with:
```bash
curl &quot;http://localhost:9187/metrics&quot;
```

Example Prometheus config:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: postgres
    static_configs:
      - targets: [&quot;127.0.0.1:9187&quot;] # Replace IP with the hostname of the docker container if you&#039;re running the container in a separate network
```

Now use the DATA_SOURCE_PASS_FILE with a mounted file containing the password to prevent having the password in an environment variable.

The container process runs with uid/gid 65534 (important for file permissions).

## Multi-Target Support (BETA)
**This Feature is in beta and may require changes in future releases. Feedback is welcome.**

This exporter supports the [multi-target pattern](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/multi-target-exporter/). This allows running a single instance of this exporter for multiple postgres targets. Using the multi-target functionality of this exporter is **optional** and meant for cases where it is impossible to install the exporter as a sidecar, for example SaaS-managed services.

To use the multi-target functionality, send an http request to the endpoint `/probe?target=foo:5432` where target is set to the DSN of the postgres instance to scrape metrics from.

To avoid putting sensitive information like username and password in the URL, preconfigured auth modules are supported via the [auth_modules](#auth_modules) section of the config file. auth_modules for DSNs can be used with the `/probe` endpoint by specifying the `?auth_module=foo` http parameter.

Example Prometheus config:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: &#039;postgres&#039;
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - server1:5432
        - server2:5432
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      auth_module: [foo]
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9116  # The postgres exporter&#039;s real hostname:port.
```

## Configuration File

The configuration file controls the behavior of the exporter. It can be set using the `--config.file` command line flag and defaults to `postgres_exporter.yml`.

### auth_modules
This section defines preset authentication and connection parameters for use in the [multi-target endpoint](#multi-target-support-beta). `auth_modules` is a map of modules with the key being the identifier which can be used in the `/probe` endpoint.
Currently only the `userpass` type is supported.

Example:
```yaml
auth_modules:
  foo1: # Set this to any name you want
    type: userpass
    userpass:
      username: first
      password: firstpass
    options:
      # options become key=value parameters of the DSN
      sslmode: disable
```

## Building and running

    git clone https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter.git
    cd postgres_exporter
    make build
    ./postgres_exporter &lt;flags&gt;

To build the Docker image:

    make promu
    promu crossbuild -p linux/amd64 -p linux/armv7 -p linux/arm64 -p linux/ppc64le
    make docker

This will build the docker image as `prometheuscommunity/postgres_exporter:${branch}`.

   without a username and password component. For example, `my_pg_hostname` or
   `my_pg_hostname:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable`.

* `DATA_SOURCE_URI_FILE`
   The same as above but reads the URI from a file.

* `DATA_SOURCE_USER`
  When using `DATA_SOURCE_URI`, this environment variable is used to specify
  the username.

* `DATA_SOURCE_USER_FILE`
  The same, but reads the username from a file.

* `DATA_SOURCE_PASS`
  When using `DATA_SOURCE_URI`, this environment variable is used to specify
  the password to connect with.

* `DATA_SOURCE_PASS_FILE`
  The same as above but reads the password from a file.

* `PG_EXPORTER_WEB_TELEMETRY_PATH`
  Path under which to expose metrics. Default is `/metrics`.

* `PG_EXPORTER_DISABLE_DEFAULT_METRICS`
  Use only metrics supplied from `queries.yaml`. Value can be `true` or `false`. Default is `false`.

* `PG_EXPORTER_DISABLE_SETTINGS_METRICS`
  Use the flag if you don&#039;t want to scrape `pg_settings`. Value can be `true` or `false`. Default is `false`.

* `PG_EXPORTER_AUTO_DISCOVER_DATABASES` (DEPRECATED)
  Whether to discover the databases on a server dynamically. Value can be `true` or `false`. Default is `false`.

* `PG_EXPORTER_EXTEND_QUERY_PATH`
  Path to a YAML file containing custom queries to run. Check out [`queries.yaml`](queries.yaml)
  for examples of the format.

* `PG_EXPORTER_CONSTANT_LABELS` (DEPRECATED)
  Labels to set in all metrics. A list of `label=value` pairs, separated by commas.

* `PG_EXPORTER_EXCLUDE_DATABASES` (DEPRECATED)
  A comma-separated list of databases to remove when autoDiscoverDatabases is enabled. Default is empty string.

* `PG_EXPORTER_INCLUDE_DATABASES` (DEPRECATED)
  A comma-separated list of databases to only include when autoDiscoverDatabases is enabled. Default is empty string,
  means allow all.

* `PG_EXPORTER_METRIC_PREFIX`
  A prefix to use for each of the default metrics exported by postgres-exporter. Default is `pg`

Settings set by environment variables starting with `PG_` will be overwritten by the corresponding CLI flag if given.

### Setting the Postgres server&#039;s data source name

The PostgreSQL server&#039;s [data source name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_source_name)
must be set via the `DATA_SOURCE_NAME` environment variable.

For running it locally on a default Debian/Ubuntu install, this will work (transpose to init script as appropriate):

    sudo -u postgres DATA_SOURCE_NAME=&quot;user=postgres host=/var/run/postgresql/ sslmode=disable&quot; postgres_exporter

Also, you can set a list of sources to scrape different instances from the one exporter setup. Just define a comma separated string.

    sudo -u postgres DATA_SOURCE_NAME=&quot;port=5432,port=6432&quot; postgres_exporter

See the [github.com/lib/pq](http://github.com/lib/pq) module for other ways to format the connection string.

### Adding new metrics

The exporter will attempt to dynamically export additional metrics if they are added in the
future, but they will be marked as &quot;untyped&quot;. Additional metric maps can be easily created
from Postgres documentation by copying the tables and using the following Python snippet:

```python
x = &quot;&quot;&quot;tab separated raw text of a documentation table&quot;&quot;&quot;
for l in StringIO(x):
    column, ctype, description = l.split(&#039;\t&#039;)
    print &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;{0}&quot; : {{ prometheus.CounterValue, prometheus.NewDesc(&quot;pg_stat_database_{0}&quot;, &quot;{2}&quot;, nil, nil) }}, &quot;&quot;&quot;.format(column.strip(), ctype, description.strip())
```
Adjust the value of the resultant prometheus value type appropriately. This helps build
rich self-documenting metrics for the exporter.

### Adding new metrics via a config file (DEPRECATED)

This feature is deprecated in favor of built-in collector functions. For generic SQL database monitoring see the [sql_exporter](https://github.com/burningalchemist/sql_exporter).

The -extend.query-path command-line argument specifies a YAML file containing additional queries to run.
Some examples are provided in [queries.yaml](queries.yaml).

### Disabling default metrics
To work with non-officially-supported postgres versions (e.g. 8.2.15),
or variants of postgres (e.g. Greenplum), you can disable the default metrics with the `--disable-default-metrics`
flag. This removes all built-in metrics, and uses only metrics defined by queries in the `queries.yaml` file you supply
(so you must supply one, otherwise the exporter will return nothing but internal statuses and not your database).

### Automatically discover databases (DEPRECATED)
To scrape metrics from all databases on a database server, the database DSN&#039;s can be dynamically discovered via the
`--auto-discover-databases` flag. When true, `SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datallowconn = true AND datistemplate = false and datname != current_database()` is run for all configured DSN&#039;s. From the
result a new set of DSN&#039;s is created for which the metrics are scraped.

In addition, the option `--exclude-databases` adds the possibily to filter the result from the auto discovery to discard databases you do not need.

If you want to include only subset of databases, you can use option `--include-databases`. Exporter still makes request to
`pg_database` table, but do scrape from only if database is in include list.

### Running as non-superuser

To be able to collect metrics from `pg_stat*` views as non-superuser in PostgreSQL
server versions &gt;= 10 you can grant the `pg_monitor` or `pg_read_all_stats` [built-in roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/predefined-roles.html) to the user. If
you need to monitor older PostgreSQL servers, you will have to create functions
and views as a superuser, and assign permissions separately to those.

```sql
-- To use IF statements, hence to be able to check if the user exists before
-- attempting creation, we need to switch to procedural SQL (PL/pgSQL)
-- instead of standard SQL.
-- More: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/plpgsql-overview.html
-- To preserve compatibility with &lt;9.0, DO blocks are not used; instead,
-- a function is created and dropped.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION __tmp_create_user() returns void as $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT                       -- SELECT list can stay empty for this
          FROM   pg_catalog.pg_user
          WHERE  usename = &#039;postgres_exporter&#039;) THEN
    CREATE USER postgres_exporter;
  END IF;
END;
$$ language plpgsql;

SELECT __tmp_create_user();
DROP FUNCTION __tmp_create_user();

ALTER USER postgres_exporter WITH PASSWORD &#039;password&#039;;
ALTER USER postgres_exporter SET SEARCH_PATH TO postgres_exporter,pg_catalog;

-- If deploying as non-superuser (for example in AWS RDS), uncomment the GRANT
-- line below and replace &lt;MASTER_USER&gt; with your root user.
-- GRANT postgres_exporter TO &lt;MASTER_USER&gt;;

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO postgres_exporter;
```

Run following command if you use PostgreSQL versions &gt;= 10
```sql
GRANT pg_monitor to postgres_exporter;
```

Run following SQL commands only if you use PostgreSQL versions older than 10.
In PostgreSQL, views run with the permissions of the user that created them so
they can act as security barriers. Functions need to be created to share this
data with the non-superuser. Only creating the views will leave out the most
important bits of data.
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS postgres_exporter;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA postgres_exporter TO postgres_exporter;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_pg_stat_activity() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_activity AS
$$ SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity; $$
LANGUAGE sql
VOLATILE
SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW postgres_exporter.pg_stat_activity
AS
  SELECT * from get_pg_stat_activity();

GRANT SELECT ON postgres_exporter.pg_stat_activity TO postgres_exporter;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_pg_stat_replication() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_replication AS
$$ SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_replication; $$
LANGUAGE sql
VOLATILE
SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW postgres_exporter.pg_stat_replication
AS
  SELECT * FROM get_pg_stat_replication();

GRANT SELECT ON postgres_exporter.pg_stat_replication TO postgres_exporter;

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_pg_stat_statements() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_statements AS
$$ SELECT * FROM public.pg_stat_statements; $$
LANGUAGE sql
VOLATILE
SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW postgres_exporter.pg_stat_statements
AS
  SELECT * FROM get_pg_stat_statements();

GRANT SELECT ON postgres_exporter.pg_stat_statements TO postgres_exporter;
```

&gt; **NOTE**
&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Remember to use `postgres` database name in the connection string:
&gt; ```
&gt; DATA_SOURCE_NAME=postgresql://postgres_exporter:password@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
&gt; ```

### Server SDKs

Server SDKs enable your backend to generate [access tokens](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/),
call [server APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/server/server-apis/), and
receive [webhooks](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/webhooks/). In addition, the Go SDK includes client capabilities,
enabling you to build automations that behave like end-users.

### Tools

-   [CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) - command line interface &amp; load tester
-   [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/livekit/livekit-server)
-   [Helm charts](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-helm)

## Install

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend installing [LiveKit CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) along with the server. It lets you access
&gt; server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic.

The following will install LiveKit&#039;s media server:

### MacOS

```shell
brew install livekit
```

### Linux

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io | bash
```

### Windows

Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases/latest)

## Getting Started

### Starting LiveKit

Start LiveKit in development mode by running `livekit-server --dev`. It&#039;ll use a placeholder API key/secret pair.

```
API Key: devkey
API Secret: secret
```

To customize your setup for production, refer to our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/)

### Creating access token

A user connecting to a LiveKit room requires an [access token](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/#creating-a-token). Access
tokens (JWT) encode the user&#039;s identity and the room permissions they&#039;ve been granted. You can generate a token with our
CLI:

```shell
lk token create \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --join --room my-first-room --identity user1 \
    --valid-for 24h
```

### Test with example app

Head over to our [example app](https://example.livekit.io) and enter a generated token to connect to your LiveKit
server. This app is built with our [React SDK](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-react).

Once connected, your video and audio are now being published to your new LiveKit instance!

### Simulating a test publisher

```shell
lk room join \
    --url ws://localhost:7880 \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --identity bot-user1 \
    --publish-demo \
    my-first-room
```

This command publishes a looped demo video to a room. Due to how the video clip was encoded (keyframes every 3s),
there&#039;s a slight delay before the browser has sufficient data to begin rendering frames. This is an artifact of the
simulation.

## Deployment

### Use LiveKit Cloud

LiveKit Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run LiveKit. Every project gets free monthly bandwidth and
transcoding credits.

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

### Self-host

Read our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/) for more information.

## Building from source

Pre-requisites:

-   Go 1.23+ is installed
-   GOPATH/bin is in your PATH

Then run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/livekit/livekit
cd livekit
./bootstrap.sh
mage
```

国外很多网站都在使用 Cloudflare CDN，但分配给中国内地访客的 IP 并不友好（延迟高、丢包多、速度慢）。  
虽然 Cloudflare 公开了所有 [IP 段](https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/ips/) ，但想要在这么多 IP 中找到适合自己的，怕是要累死，于是就有了这个软件。

当然了，本项目也支持对 **`其他 CDN / 多个解析 IP 的网站`** 延迟测速，但相对应的下载测速地址需自行寻找。

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Cloudflare CDN 已**明文禁止代理**方式使用，对于**代理套 CDN** 的自行承担风险，请勿过度依赖 [#382](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/discussions/382) [#383](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/discussions/383)

## \# 快速使用

### 下载运行

1. 下载编译好的可执行文件（ [Github Releases](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases) / [蓝奏云](https://xiu.lanzoub.com/b0742hkxe) ）并解压。  
2. 双击运行 `cfst.exe` 文件（Windows 系统），等待测速完成...

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击查看 Windows 系统下其他安装方式」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

如果你有 scoop(Windows 下的命令行安装程序)，则可以这样安装:

```sh
# 添加最多人使用的中文软件包仓库：dorado
scoop bucket add dorado https://github.com/chawyehsu/dorado
# 安装cloudflare-speedtest
scoop install dorado/cloudflare-speedtest
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击查看 Linux 系统下的使用示例 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

以下命令仅为示例，版本号和文件名请前往 [**Releases**](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases) 查看。

``` yaml
# 如果是第一次使用，则建议创建新文件夹（后续更新时，跳过该步骤）
mkdir cfst

# 进入文件夹（后续更新，只需要从这里重复下面的下载、解压命令即可）
cd cfst

# 下载 CFST 压缩包（自行根据需求替换 URL 中 [版本号] 和 [文件名]）
wget -N https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_amd64.tar.gz
# 如果你是在国内网络环境中下载，那么请使用下面这几个镜像加速之一：
# wget -N https://ghfast.top/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz
# wget -N https://wget.la/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz
# wget -N https://ghproxy.net/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz
# wget -N https://gh-proxy.com/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz
# wget -N https://hk.gh-proxy.com/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.3.4/cfst_linux_arm64.tar.gz
# 如果下载失败的话，尝试删除 -N 参数（如果是为了更新，则记得提前删除旧压缩包 rm cfst_linux_amd64.tar.gz ）

# 解压（不需要删除旧文件，会直接覆盖，自行根据需求替换 文件名）
tar -zxf cfst_linux_amd64.tar.gz

# 赋予执行权限
chmod +x cfst

# 运行（不带参数）
./cfst

# 运行（带参数示例）
./cfst -tl 200 -dn 20
```

&gt; 如果平**均延迟非常低**（如 0.xx），则说明 CFST **测速时走了代理**，请先关闭代理软件后再测速。  
&gt; 如果在**路由器**上运行，建议先关闭路由器内的代理（或将其排除），否则测速结果可能会**不准确/无法使用**。

&lt;/details&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 注意！本软件仅适用于网站，**不支持给使用 UDP 协议的 Cloudflare WARP 优选 IP**，具体见：[#392](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/discussions/392)

### 结果示例

测速完毕后，默认会显示**最快的 10 个 IP**，示例（仅为输出内容示例）：

``` bash
IP 地址           已发送  已接收  丢包率  平均延迟  下载速度(MB/s)  地区码

# 如果平均延迟非常低（如 0.xx），则说明 CFST 测速时走了代理，请先关闭代理软件后再测速。
# 如果在路由器上运行，请先关闭路由器内的代理（或将其排除），否则测速结果可能会不准确/无法使用。

# 因为每次测速都是在每个 IP 段中随机 IP，所以每次的测速结果都不可能相同，这是正常的！

# 注意！我发现电脑开机后第一次测速延迟会明显偏高（手动 TCPing 也一样），后续测速都正常
# 因此建议大家开机后第一次正式测速前，先随便测几个 IP（无需等待延迟测速完成，只要进度条动了就可以直接关了）

# 软件在 默认参数 下的整个流程大概步骤：
# 1. 延迟测速（默认 TCPing 模式，HTTPing 模式需要手动加上参数）
# 2. 延迟排序（延迟 从低到高 排序并按条件过滤，不同丢包率会分开排序，因此可能会有一些延迟低但丢包的 IP 排到后面）
# 3. 下载测速（从延迟最低的 IP 开始依次下载测速，默认测够 10 个就会停止）
# 4. 速度排序（速度从高到低排序）
# 5. 输出结果（通过参数控制是否输出到命令行(-p 0)或输出到文件(-o &quot;&quot;)）

# 注意：输出的结果文件 result.csv 通过微软 Excel 表格打开会中文乱码，这是正常的，其他表格软件/记事本都显示正常
```

测速结果第一行就是**既下载速度最快、又平均延迟最低的最快 IP**！

完整结果保存在当前目录下的 `result.csv` 文件中，用**记事本/表格软件**打开，格式如下：

```

## \# 进阶使用

直接运行使用的是默认参数，如果想要测速结果更全面、更符合自己的要求，可以自定义参数。

```Dart
C:\&gt;cfst.exe -h

CloudflareSpeedTest vX.X.X

https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest

参数：
    -n 200
        延迟测速线程；越多延迟测速越快，性能弱的设备 (如路由器) 请勿太高；(默认 200 最多 1000)
    -t 4
        延迟测速次数；单个 IP 延迟测速的次数；(默认 4 次)
    -dn 10
        下载测速数量；延迟测速并排序后，从最低延迟起下载测速的数量；(默认 10 个)
    -dt 10
        下载测速时间；单个 IP 下载测速最长时间，不能太短；(默认 10 秒)
    -tp 443
        指定测速端口；延迟测速/下载测速时使用的端口；(默认 443 端口)
    -url https://cf.xiu2.xyz/url
        指定测速地址；延迟测速(HTTPing)/下载测速时使用的地址，默认地址不保证可用性，建议自建；
        当下载测速时，软件会从 HTTP 响应头中获取该 IP 当前地区码（支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN）并显示出来。

    -httping
        切换测速模式；延迟测速模式改为 HTTP 协议，所用测试地址为 [-url] 参数；(默认 TCPing)
        当使用 HTTP 测速模式时，软件会从 HTTP 响应头中获取该 IP 当前地区码（支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN）并显示出来。
        注意：HTTPing 本质上也算一种 网络扫描 行为，因此如果你在服务器上面运行，需要降低并发(-n)，否则可能会被一些严格的商家暂停服务。
        如果你遇到 HTTPing 首次测速可用 IP 数量正常，后续测速越来越少甚至直接为 0，但停一段时间后又恢复了的情况，那么也可能是被 运营商、Cloudflare CDN 认为你在网络扫描而 触发临时限制机制，因此才会过一会儿就恢复了，建议降低并发(-n)减少这种情况的发生。
    -httping-code 200
        有效状态代码；HTTPing 延迟测速时网页返回的有效 HTTP 状态码，仅限一个；(默认 200 301 302)
    -cfcolo HKG,KHH,NRT,LAX,SEA,SJC,FRA,MAD
        匹配指定地区；IATA 机场地区码或国家/城市码，英文逗号分隔，大小写均可，仅 HTTPing 模式可用；(默认 所有地区)
        支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN
        其中 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly 使用的是 IATA 三字机场地区码，如：HKG,LAX
        其中 CDN77、Bunny 使用的是 二字国家/区域码，如：US,CN
        其中 Gcore 使用的是 二字城市码，如：FR,AM
        因此大家使用 -cfcolo 指定地区码时要根据不同的 CDN 来指定不同类型的地区码。

    -tl 200
        平均延迟上限；只输出低于指定平均延迟的 IP，各上下限条件可搭配使用；(默认 9999 ms)
    -tll 40
        平均延迟下限；只输出高于指定平均延迟的 IP；(默认 0 ms)
    -tlr 0.2
        丢包几率上限；只输出低于/等于指定丢包率的 IP，范围 0.00~1.00，0 过滤掉任何丢包的 IP；(默认 1.00)
    -sl 5
        下载速度下限；只输出高于指定下载速度的 IP，凑够指定数量 [-dn] 才会停止测速；(默认 0.00 MB/s)

    -p 10
        显示结果数量；测速后直接显示指定数量的结果，为 0 时不显示结果直接退出；(默认 10 个)
    -f ip.txt
        IP段数据文件；如路径含有空格请加上引号；支持其他 CDN IP段；(默认 ip.txt)
    -ip 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2/24,2606:4700::/32
        指定IP段数据；直接通过参数指定要测速的 IP 段数据，英文逗号分隔；(默认 空)
    -o result.csv
        写入结果文件；如路径含有空格请加上引号；值为空时不写入文件 [-o &quot;&quot;]；(默认 result.csv)
        注意：在一些环境下使用 -o &quot;&quot; 可能会被忽略掉这个空参数导致报错，可加个空格 -o &quot; &quot; 解决

    -dd
        禁用下载测速；禁用后测速结果会按延迟排序 (默认按下载速度排序)；(默认 启用)
    -allip
        测速全部的IP；对 IP 段中的每个 IP (仅支持 IPv4) 进行测速；(默认 每个 /24 段随机测速一个 IP)

    -debug
        调试输出模式；会在一些非预期情况下输出更多日志以便判断原因；(默认 关闭)
        目前该功能仅针对 HTTPing 延迟测速过程 及 下载测速过程，当过程中因为各种原因导致当前 IP 测速中断都会输出错误原因
        例如：HTTPing 延迟测速过程中，因为 HTTP 状态码不符合或测速地址有问题或超时等原因而终止测速
        例如：下载测速过程中，因为下载测速地址有问题（被阻断、403状态码、超时）等原因而终止测速（导致显示 0.00）

&gt; 刚接触 CFST 的人，可能会迷惑**明明延迟测速可用 IP 有 30 个，怎么最后只剩下 3 个了呢？**  
&gt; 下载测速里的队列又是什么意思？难道我下载测速还要排队？

CFST 会先延迟测速，在这过程中进度条右侧会实时显示可用 IP 数量（`可用: 30`），但注意该可用数量指的是**测试通过没有超时的 IP 数量**，和延迟上下限、丢包条件无关。当延迟测速完成后，因为还指定了**延迟上下限、丢包**的条件，所以按照条件过滤后只剩下 `10` 个了（也就是等待下载测速的 `队列：10`）。

即以上示例中，`321` 个 IP 延迟测速完成后，只有 `30` 个 IP 测试通过没有超时，然后根据延迟上下限范围：`40 ~ 150 ms` 及丢包上限条件过滤后，只剩下 `10` 个满足要求的 IP 了。如果你 `-dd` 禁用了下载测速，那么就会直接输出这 `10` 个 IP 了。当然该示例并未禁用，因此接下来软件会继续对这 `10` 个 IP 进行下载测速（`队列：10`）。

&gt; 因为下载测速是单线程一个个 IP 挨着排队测速的，因此等待下载测速的 IP 数量才会叫做 `队列`。

****

&gt; 你可能注意到了，**明明指定了要找到 5 个满足下载速度条件的 IP，怎么才 3 个就 “中断” 了呢？**

下载测速进度条中的 `3 / 5`，前者指的是找到了 `3` 个满足下载速度下限条件的 IP（即下载速度高于 `1 MB/s` ），后者 `5` 指的是你要求找到 `5` 个满足下载速度下限条件的 IP（`-dn 5`）。

&gt; 另外，提醒一下，如果你指定的 `-dn` 大于下载测速队列，比如你延迟测速后只剩下 `4` 个 IP 了，那么下载测速进度条中后面的数字就会和下载测速队列一样都是 `4` 个，而非你 `-dn` 指定的 `5` 个了。

软件在测速完这 `10` 个 IP 后，只找到了 `3` 个下载速度高于 `1 MB/s` 的 IP，剩下的 `7` 个 IP 都是 “不及格” 的。

因此，这不是 `“每次测速都不到 5 就中断了”`，而是所有 IP 都下载测速完了，但却只找到了 `3` 个满足条件的。

****

还有一种情况，那就是当可用 IP 很多时（几百几千），你还设置了下载速度条件，那么可能就会遇到：**怎么下载测速进度条老是卡在 `X / 5` 了呢？**

这其实并不是卡住了，而是只有当找到一个满足条件的 IP 时，进度条才会 +1，因此如果一直找不到，那么 CFST 就会一直下载测速下去，因此在表现为进度条卡住不动，但这也是在提醒你：你设置的下载速度条件对你来说已经高于实际了，你需要适当调低预期。

****

如果不想遇到这种全部测速一遍都没几个满足条件的情况，那么就要**调低下载速度上限参数 `-sl`**，或者移除。

因为只要指定了 `-sl` 参数，那么只要没有凑够 `-dn` 的数量（默认 10 个），就会一直测速下去，直到凑够或全部测速完。移除 `-sl` 并添加 `-dn 20` 参数，这样就是只测速延迟最低的前 20 个 IP，测速完就停止，节省时间。

****

另外，如果全部队列 IP 都测速完了，但一个满足下载速度条件的 IP 都没有，你可能需要调低预期的下载测速下限条件，但你需要知道当前的大概测速速度都在什么范围，那么你就可以加上 `-debug` 参数开启调试模式，这样再遇到这种情况时，就会**忽略条件返回所有测速结果**，你就能看到这些 IP 的下载速度都有多少，心里也就有数了，然后**适当调低 `-sl` 再试试**。

&gt; 注意，如果你**没有指定**下载测速下限 `-sl` 条件，那么无论什么情况下 CFST 都会**输出所有测速结果**。

同样，延迟测速方面，`可用: 30`、`队列：10` 这两个数值也可以让你清楚，你设置的延迟条件对你来说是否过于苛刻。如果可用 IP 一大堆，但条件过滤后只剩下 2、3 个，那不用说就知道需要**调低预期的延迟/丢包条件**了。

这两个机制，一个是告诉你**延迟丢包条件**是否合适的，一个是告诉你**下载速度条件**是否合适的。

&lt;/details&gt;

### 使用示例

Windows 要指定参数需要在 CMD 中运行，或者把参数添加到快捷方式目标中。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; - 各参数均有**默认值**，当使用默认值时参数可以省略（**按需选择**），参数**不分前后顺序**。  
&gt; - Windows **PowerShell** 只需把下面命令中的 `cfst.exe` 改为 `.\cfst.exe` 即可。  
&gt; - Linux / macOS 系统只需要把下面命令中的 `cfst.exe` 改为 `./cfst` 即可。

****

#### \# CMD 带参数运行

对命令行程序不熟悉的人，可能不知道该如何带参数运行，我就简单说一下。

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击展开 查看内容 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

很多人打开 CMD 直接就以**绝对路径**运行 CFST 会报错，这是因为默认的 `-f ip.txt` 参数是相对路径，需要指定绝对路径的 ip.txt 才行，但这样毕竟太麻烦了，因此还是建议进入 CFST 程序目录下，以**相对路径**方式运行：

**方式 一**：
1. 打开 CFST 程序所在目录  
2. 空白处按下 &lt;kbd&gt;Shift + 鼠标右键&lt;/kbd&gt; 显示右键菜单  
3. 选择 **\[在此处打开命令窗口\]** 来打开 CMD 窗口，此时默认就位于当前目录下  
4. 输入带参数的命令，如：`cfst.exe -tl 200 -dn 20` 即可运行

**方式 二**：
1. 打开 CFST 程序所在目录  
2. 直接在文件夹地址栏中全选(或清空)并输入 `cmd` 回车就能打开 CMD 窗口，此时默认就位于当前目录下  
4. 输入带参数的命令，如：`cfst.exe -tl 200 -dn 20` 即可运行

&gt; 当然你也可以随便打开一个 CMD 窗口，然后输入如 `cd /d &quot;D:\Program Files\cfst&quot;` 来进入程序目录

&gt; **提示**：如果用的是 **PowerShell** 只需把命令中的 `cfst.exe` 改为 `.\cfst.exe` 即可。  
&gt; **注意**：在 **PowerShell** 下使用 `-o &quot;&quot;` 会被忽略掉空参数导致报错，可加个空格 `-o &quot; &quot;` 解决

&lt;/details&gt;

****

#### \# Windows 快捷方式带参数运行

如果不经常修改运行参数（比如平时都是直接双击运行）的人，建议使用快捷方式，更方便点。

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击展开 查看内容 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****

右键 `cfst.exe` 文件 - **\[创建快捷方式\]**，然后右键该快捷方式 - **\[属性\]**，修改其**目标**：

``` bash
# 如果要不输出结果文件，那么请加上 -o &quot; &quot;，引号里的是空格（不加空格会导致该空参数被忽略从而报错）。
D:\ABC\cfst\cfst.exe -tl 200 -dn 20 -o &quot; &quot;

# 如果文件路径包含引号，则需要把启动参数放在引号外面，记得引号和 - 之间有空格。
&quot;D:\Program Files\cfst\cfst.exe&quot; -tl 200 -dn 20 -o &quot; &quot;

# 注意！快捷方式 - 起始位置 不能是空的，否则就会因为绝对路径而找不到 ip.txt 文件
```

&lt;/details&gt;

****

#### \# IPv4/IPv6

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「 点击展开 查看内容 」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

****
``` bash
# 指定自带的 IPv4 数据文件可测速这些 IPv4 地址（-f 默认值就是 ip.txt，所以该参数可省略）
cfst.exe -f ip.txt

# 指定自带的 IPv6 数据文件可测速这些 IPv6 地址
# 另外，v2.1.0 版本后支持 IPv4+IPv6 混合测速并移除了 -ipv6 参数，因此一个文件内可以同时包含 IPv4+IPv6 地址
cfst.exe -f ipv6.txt

# 也可以直接通过参数指定要测速的 IP
cfst.exe -ip 1.1.1.1,2606:4700::/32
```

&gt; 测速 IPv6 时，可能会注意到每次测速数量都不一样，了解原因： [#120](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/issues/120)  
&gt; 因为 IPv6 太多（以亿为单位），且绝大部分 IP 段压根未启用，所以我只扫了一部分可用的 IPv6 段写到 `ipv6.txt` 文件中，有兴趣的可以自行扫描增删，ASN 数据源来自：[bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net/AS13335#_prefixes6)

#### \# HTTPing

****

目前有两种延迟测速模式，分别为 **TCP 协议、HTTP 协议**。  
TCP 协议耗时更短、消耗资源更少，超时时间为 1 秒，该协议为默认模式。  
HTTP 协议适用于快速测试某域名指向某 IP 时是否可以访问，超时时间为 2 秒。  
同一个 IP，各协议去 Ping 得到的延迟一般为：**ICMP &lt; TCP &lt; HTTP**，越靠右对丢包等网络波动越敏感。

&gt; 注意：HTTPing 本质上也算一种**网络扫描**行为，因此如果你在服务器上面运行，需要**降低并发**(`-n`)，否则可能会被一些严格的商家暂停服务。如果你遇到 HTTPing 首次测速可用 IP 数量正常，后续测速越来越少甚至直接为 0，但停一段时间后又恢复了的情况，那么也可能是被 运营商、Cloudflare CDN 认为你在网络扫描而**触发临时限制机制**，因此才会过一会儿就恢复了，建议**降低并发**(`-n`)减少这种情况的发生。

&gt; 另外，本软件 HTTPing 仅获取**响应头(response headers)**，并不获取正文内容（即 URL 文件大小不影响 HTTPing 测试，但如果你还要下载测速的话，那么还是需要一个大文件的），类似于 curl -i 功能。

&gt; 另外，HTTPing 过程中，软件会从 HTTP 响应头中获取该 IP 当前地区码（支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN）并显示出来，而 TCPing 过程中无法这样做（但 下载测速 时也会这样做来获取地区码，毕竟下载测速也是个 HTTP 链接）

``` bash
# 只需加上 -httping 参数即可切换到 HTTP 协议延迟测速模式
cfst.exe -httping

# 软件会根据访问时网页返回的有效 HTTP 状态码来判断可用性（当然超时也算），默认对返回 200 301 302 这三个 HTTP 状态码的视为有效，可以手动指定认为有效的 HTTP 状态码，但只能指定一个（你需要提前确定测试地址正常情况下会返回哪个状态码）
cfst.exe -httping -httping-code 200

# 通过 -url 参数来指定 HTTPing 测试地址（可以是任意网页 URL，不局限于具体文件地址）
cfst.exe -httping -url https://cf.xiu2.xyz/url
# 如果你要 HTTPing 测试其他网站/CDN，那么指定一个该网站/使用该 CDN 的地址（因为软件默认地址是 Cloudflare 的，只能用于测试 Cloudflare 的 IP）

# 注意：如果测速地址为 HTTP 协议，记得加上 -tp 80（这个参数会影响 延迟测速/下载测速 时使用的端口）
# 同理，如果要测速 80 端口，那么也需要加上 -url 参数来指定一个 http:// 协议的地址才行（且该地址不会强制重定向至 HTTPS），如果是非 80 443 端口，那么需要确定该下载测速地址是否支持通过该端口访问。
cfst.exe -httping -tp 80 -url http://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5952/movie_max.webm
```

****

Cloudflare CDN 的节点 IP 是 Anycast IP，即每个 IP 对应的服务器节点及地区不是固定的，而是动态变化的，**不同地区、不同运营商、不同时间段**访问**同一个 IP** 分配到的服务器节点地区和路线也都是不一样的（比如同一个 IP，美国人访问就是分配到就近的美国节点服务器，日本人访问则就又变成了就近的日本节点服务器了，国内内地就比较特殊了，只能给你分配到其他国家，当然不同的 IP 段路由变化/分配逻辑也是不同的，有的 IP 段会较为固定）。

&gt; **注意**！虽然 Cloudflare CDN 有很多亚洲节点，但**不代表你就能用上**，新加坡人测速可能随便一抓一大把的新加坡节点，但你全部扫一遍可能都遇不到一个，因为这是由 CDN 控制的。Anycast IP 的路由是经常变的，同一个 IP 今天可能是美国，明天你再访问可能就又分配到欧洲节点了（当然这只是个例子，一般没有那么频繁，这也和很多因素有关，比如线路拥塞程度，成本变动等），因此**不要对该功能有过高期待**~

或者你随便找个 Cloudflare CDN 的 IP（比如官网域名的解析 IP `104.16.123.96`），然后去那些有全球节点的[在线 Ping 测试](https://ping.sx/ping?t=104.16.123.96)网站，你就会发现这个 IP 在全球大部分地区的延迟都是个位数（而且很多都是 0.X ms），就算一些地方延迟高一些但也基本都控制在 几十ms，只有在国内才会发现突然变成了 上百ms 了。

这就是 Anycast 技术，也就只有国内大陆这种特殊的网络情况，才需要对 Anycast 的 CDN IP 进行优选。

因此，对于这种 Anycast IP 的实际服务器位置，就不能靠那些在线 IP 地址位置查询网站来判断了。

除了通过 **HTTP 响应头**获取地区码外（该功能的实现方式），还可以手动访问 `http://CloudflareIP/cdn-cgi/trace` 来获知 CDN 分配给你的实际节点地区码。

&gt; 该功能支持 **Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny** 等 CDN。  
&gt; 但注意，不是所有 CDN 都支持 Anycast 技术的，很多 CDN 会限制一个网站能使用的 IP 范围。

&gt; 其中 **Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly** 都使用的是 **`IATA 三字机场地区码`**，如：HKG,LAX  
&gt; 而 **CDN77、Bunny** 使用的是 **`二字国家/区域码`**，如：US,CN  
&gt; **Gcore** 则使用的是 **`二字城市码`**，如：FR,AM  
&gt; 因此大家使用 `-cfcolo` 指定地区码时要根据不同的 CDN 来指定不同类型的地区码。

&gt; **注意**：如果你要用于筛选 AWS CloudFront CDN 地区，那么要通过 `-url` 参数指定一个使用 AWS CloudFront CDN 的下载测速地址（因为软件默认下载测速地址是 Cloudflare CDN 的），另外有时候 HTTPing 模式测速一些 AWS CloudFront 地址会返回 403 错误，这种情况下需要加上 `-httping-code 403` 才能正确获取地区码。

``` bash
# 指定地区名后，延迟测速后得到的结果就都是指定地区的 IP 了（如果没有指定 -dd 的话则会继续进行下载测速）
# 如果延迟测速后结果为 0，则说明没有找到任何一个（未超时可用的）指定地区的 IP。
# 节点地区名为当地 IATA 机场地区码或国家/城市码，指定多个时用英文逗号分隔，v2.2.3 版本后支持小写

cfst.exe -httping -cfcolo HKG,KHH,NRT,LAX,SEA,SJC,FRA,MAD

# 注意，该参数只有在 HTTPing 延迟测速模式下才可用（因为软件是通过 HTTP 链接中的响应头来获得该 IP 的实际地区码）

# 另外，HTTPing 过程中，软件会从 HTTP 响应头中获取该 IP 当前地区码（支持 Cloudflare、AWS CloudFront、Fastly、Gcore、CDN77、Bunny 等 CDN）并显示出来，而 TCPing 过程中无法这样做（但 下载测速 时也会这样做来获取地区码，毕竟下载测速也是个 HTTP 链接）
```

  &quot;github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware&quot;
  &quot;log/slog&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;
)

func main() {
  // Echo instance
  e := echo.New()

  // Middleware
  e.Use(middleware.RequestLogger()) // use the default RequestLogger middleware with slog logger
  e.Use(middleware.Recover()) // recover panics as errors for proper error handling

  // Routes
  e.GET(&quot;/&quot;, hello)

  // Start server
  if err := e.Start(&quot;:8080&quot;); err != nil &amp;&amp; !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) {
    slog.Error(&quot;failed to start server&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, err)
  }
}

// Handler
func hello(c echo.Context) error {
  return c.String(http.StatusOK, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
}
```

## What is Ory Kratos?

Ory Kratos is an API first identity and user management system that follows [cloud architecture best practices](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/software-architecture-philosophy). It focuses on core identity workflows that almost every application needs:

- Self service login and registration
- Account verification and recovery
- Multi factor authentication
- Profile and account management
- Identity schemas and traits
- Admin APIs for lifecycle management

We recommend starting with the [Ory Kratos introduction docs](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/) to learn more about its architecture, feature set, and how it compares to other systems.

### Why Ory Kratos

Ory Kratos is designed to:

- Remove identity logic from your application code and expose it over HTTP APIs
- Work well with any UI framework through browser based and native app flows
- Scale to large numbers of identities and devices
- Integrate with the rest of the Ory stack for OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and access control
- Fit into modern cloud native environments such as Kubernetes and managed platforms
-
## Migrating from Auth0, Okta, and similar providers

If you are migrating from Auth0, Okta, or another identity provider that uses OAuth2 / OpenID Connect based login, consider using **Ory Hydra + Ory Kratos** together:

- **Ory Hydra** acts as the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect provider and can replace most authorization server and token issuing capabilities of your existing IdP.
- **Ory Kratos** provides identity, credentials, and user-facing flows (login, registration, recovery, verification, profile management).

This combination is often a drop-in replacement for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect capabilities at the protocol level. In practice, you update client configuration and endpoints to point to Hydra, migrate identities into Kratos, and keep your applications speaking the same OAuth2 / OIDC protocols they already use.

## Deployment options

You can run Ory Kratos in two main ways:

- As a managed service on the Ory Network
- As a self hosted service under your own control, with or without the Ory Enterprise License

### Use Ory Kratos on the Ory Network

The [Ory Network](https://www.ory.sh/cloud) is the fastest way to use Ory services in production. **Ory Identities** is powered by the open source Ory Kratos server and is API compatible.

The Ory Network provides:

- Identity and credential management that scales to billions of users and devices
- Registration, login, and account management flows for passkeys, biometrics, social login, SSO, and multi factor authentication
- Prebuilt login, registration, and account management pages and components
- OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for single sign on, API access, and machine to machine authorization
- Low latency permission checks based on the Zanzibar model with the Ory Permission Language
- GDPR friendly storage with data locality and compliance in mind
- Web based Ory Console and Ory CLI for administration and operations
- Cloud native APIs compatible with the open source servers
- Fair, usage based [pricing](https://www.ory.sh/pricing)

Sign up for a [free developer account](https://console.ory.sh/registration?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=kratos-readme) to get started.

### Self-host Ory Kratos

You can run Ory Kratos yourself for full control over infrastructure, deployment, and customization.

The [install guide](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/install) explains how to:

* Install Kratos on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Docker
* Configure databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and CockroachDB
* Deploy to Kubernetes and other orchestration systems
* Build Kratos from source

This guide uses the open source distribution to get you started without license requirements. It is a great fit for individuals, researchers, hackers, and companies that want to experiment, prototype, or run unimportant workloads without SLAs. You get the full core engine, and you are free to inspect, extend, and build it from source.

If you run Kratos as part of a business-critical system, for example login and account recovery for all your users, you should use a commercial agreement to reduce operational and security risk. The **Ory Enterprise License (OEL)** layers on top of self-hosted Kratos and provides:

* Additional enterprise features that are not available in the open source version such as SCIM, SAML, organization login (&quot;SSO&quot;), CAPTCHAs and more
* Regular security releases, including CVE patches, with service level agreements
* Support for advanced scaling, multi-tenancy, and complex deployments
* Premium support options with SLAs, direct access to engineers, and onboarding help
* Access to a private Docker registry with frequent and vetted, up-to-date enterprise builds

For guaranteed CVE fixes, current enterprise builds, advanced features, and support in production, you need a valid [Ory Enterprise License](https://www.ory.com/ory-enterprise-license) and access to the Ory Enterprise Docker registry. To learn more, [contact the Ory team](https://www.ory.sh/contact/).

## Quickstart

Install the [Ory CLI](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/installation) and create a new project to try Ory Identities.

```bash
# Install the Ory CLI if you do not have it yet:
bash &lt;(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) -b . ory
sudo mv ./ory /usr/local/bin/

# Sign in or sign up
ory auth

# Create a new project
ory create project --create-workspace &quot;Ory Open Source&quot; --name &quot;GitHub Quickstart&quot;  --use-project
ory open ax login
```

KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. KEDA serves
as a Kubernetes Metrics Server and allows users to define autoscaling rules using a dedicated Kubernetes custom
resource definition.

KEDA can run on both the cloud and the edge, integrates natively with Kubernetes components such as the Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler, and has no external dependencies.

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.

Gophish
=======

![Build Status](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gophish/gophish?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/gophish/gophish)

Gophish: Open-Source Phishing Toolkit

[Gophish](https://getgophish.com) is an open-source phishing toolkit designed for businesses and penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily setup and execute phishing engagements and security awareness training.

### Install

Installation of Gophish is dead-simple - just download and extract the zip containing the [release for your system](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/), and run the binary. Gophish has binary releases for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

### Building From Source
**If you are building from source, please note that Gophish requires Go v1.10 or above!**

To build Gophish from source, simply run ```git clone https://github.com/gophish/gophish.git``` and ```cd``` into the project source directory. Then, run ```go build```. After this, you should have a binary called ```gophish``` in the current directory.

### Docker
You can also use Gophish via the official Docker container [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/gophish/gophish/).

### Setup
After running the Gophish binary, open an Internet browser to https://localhost:3333 and login with the default username and password listed in the log output.
e.g.
```
time=&quot;2020-07-29T01:24:08Z&quot; level=info msg=&quot;Please login with the username admin and the password 4304d5255378177d&quot;
```

Releases of Gophish prior to v0.10.1 have a default username of `admin` and password of `gophish`.

Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by \*NIX kernels, written
in Go with pluggable metric collectors.

The [Windows exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter) is recommended for Windows users.
To expose NVIDIA GPU metrics, [prometheus-dcgm
](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter)
can be used.

## Installation and Usage

If you are new to Prometheus and `node_exporter` there is a [simple step-by-step guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/).

The `node_exporter` listens on HTTP port 9100 by default. See the `--help` output for more options.

### Ansible

For automated installs with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), there is the [Prometheus Community role](https://github.com/prometheus-community/ansible).

### Docker

The `node_exporter` is designed to monitor the host system. Deploying in containers requires
extra care in order to avoid monitoring the container itself.

For situations where containerized deployment is needed, some extra flags must be used to allow
the `node_exporter` access to the host namespaces.

Be aware that any non-root mount points you want to monitor will need to be bind-mounted
into the container.

If you start container for host monitoring, specify `path.rootfs` argument.
This argument must match path in bind-mount of host root. The node\_exporter will use
`path.rootfs` as prefix to access host filesystem.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --net=&quot;host&quot; \
  --pid=&quot;host&quot; \
  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot; \
  quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest \
  --path.rootfs=/host
```

For Docker compose, similar flag changes are needed.

```yaml
---
version: &#039;3.8&#039;

services:
  node_exporter:
    image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest
    container_name: node_exporter
    command:
      - &#039;--path.rootfs=/host&#039;
    network_mode: host
    pid: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - &#039;/:/host:ro,rslave&#039;
```

On some systems, the `timex` collector requires an additional Docker flag,
`--cap-add=SYS_TIME`, in order to access the required syscalls.

## Collectors

There is varying support for collectors on each operating system. The tables
below list all existing collectors and the supported systems.

Collectors are enabled by providing a `--collector.&lt;name&gt;` flag.
Collectors that are enabled by default can be disabled by providing a `--no-collector.&lt;name&gt;` flag.
To enable only some specific collector(s), use `--collector.disable-defaults --collector.&lt;name&gt; ...`.

### Include &amp; Exclude flags

A few collectors can be configured to include or exclude certain patterns using dedicated flags. The exclude flags are used to indicate &quot;all except&quot;, while the include flags are used to say &quot;none except&quot;. Note that these flags are mutually exclusive on collectors that support both.

Example:

```txt
--collector.filesystem.mount-points-exclude=^/(dev|proc|sys|var/lib/docker/.+|var/lib/kubelet/.+)($|/)
```

### Disabled by default

`node_exporter` also implements a number of collectors that are disabled by default.  Reasons for this vary by
collector, and may include:
* High cardinality
* Prolonged runtime that exceeds the Prometheus `scrape_interval` or `scrape_timeout`
* Significant resource demands on the host

You can enable additional collectors as desired by adding them to your
init system&#039;s or service supervisor&#039;s startup configuration for
`node_exporter` but caution is advised.  Enable at most one at a time,
testing first on a non-production system, then by hand on a single
production node.  When enabling additional collectors, you should
carefully monitor the change by observing the `
scrape_duration_seconds` metric to ensure that collection completes
and does not time out.  In addition, monitor the
`scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` metric to see the changes in
cardinality.

### Perf Collector

The `perf` collector may not work out of the box on some Linux systems due to kernel
configuration and security settings. To allow access, set the following `sysctl`
parameter:

```
sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=X
```

- 2 allow only user-space measurements (default since Linux 4.6).
- 1 allow both kernel and user measurements (default before Linux 4.6).
- 0 allow access to CPU-specific data but not raw tracepoint samples.
- -1 no restrictions.

Depending on the configured value different metrics will be available, for most
cases `0` will provide the most complete set. For more information see [`man 2
perf_event_open`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html).

By default, the `perf` collector will only collect metrics of the CPUs that
`node_exporter` is running on (ie
[`runtime.NumCPU`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#NumCPU). If this is
insufficient (e.g. if you run `node_exporter` with its CPU affinity set to
specific CPUs), you can specify a list of alternate CPUs by using the
`--collector.perf.cpus` flag. For example, to collect metrics on CPUs 2-6, you
would specify: `--collector.perf --collector.perf.cpus=2-6`. The CPU
configuration is zero indexed and can also take a stride value; e.g.
`--collector.perf --collector.perf.cpus=1-10:5` would collect on CPUs
1, 5, and 10.

The `perf` collector is also able to collect
[tracepoint](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/tracepoint.html)
counts when using the `--collector.perf.tracepoint` flag. Tracepoints can be
found using [`perf list`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/perf.1.html) or
from debugfs. And example usage of this would be
`--collector.perf.tracepoint=&quot;sched:sched_process_exec&quot;`.

### Sysctl Collector

The `sysctl` collector can be enabled with `--collector.sysctl`. It supports exposing numeric sysctl values
as metrics using the `--collector.sysctl.include` flag and string values as info metrics by using the
`--collector.sysctl.include-info` flag. The flags can be repeated. For sysctl with multiple numeric values,
an optional mapping can be given to expose each value as its own metric. Otherwise an `index` label is used
to identify the different fields.

#### Examples
##### Numeric values
###### Single values
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=vm.user_reserve_kbytes`:
`vm.user_reserve_kbytes = 131072` -&gt; `node_sysctl_vm_user_reserve_kbytes 131072`

###### Multiple values
A sysctl can contain multiple values, for example:
```
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096	131072	6291456
```
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=net.ipv4.tcp_rmem` the collector will expose:
```
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;0&quot;} 4096
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;1&quot;} 131072
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;2&quot;} 6291456
```
If the indexes have defined meaning like in this case, the values can be mapped to multiple metrics by appending the mapping to the --collector.sysctl.include flag:
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=net.ipv4.tcp_rmem:min,default,max` the collector will expose:
```
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_min 4096
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_default 131072
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_max 6291456
```

##### String values
String values need to be exposed as info metric. The user selects them by using the `--collector.sysctl.include-info` flag.

###### Single values
`kernel.core_pattern = core` -&gt; `node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.core_pattern_info&quot;, value=&quot;core&quot;} 1`

###### Multiple values
Given the following sysctl:
```
kernel.seccomp.actions_avail = kill_process kill_thread trap errno trace log allow
```
Setting `--collector.sysctl.include-info=kernel.seccomp.actions_avail` will yield:
```
node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.seccomp.actions_avail&quot;, index=&quot;0&quot;, value=&quot;kill_process&quot;} 1
node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.seccomp.actions_avail&quot;, index=&quot;1&quot;, value=&quot;kill_thread&quot;} 1
...
```

### Textfile Collector

The `textfile` collector is similar to the [Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway),
in that it allows exporting of statistics from batch jobs. It can also be used
to export static metrics, such as what role a machine has. The Pushgateway
should be used for service-level metrics. The `textfile` module is for metrics
that are tied to a machine.

To use it, set the `--collector.textfile.directory` flag on the `node_exporter` commandline. The
collector will parse all files in that directory matching the glob `*.prom`
using the [text
format](http://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). **Note:** Timestamps are not supported.

To atomically push completion time for a cron job:
```
echo my_batch_job_completion_time $(date +%s) &gt; /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom.$$
mv /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom.$$ /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom
```

To statically set roles for a machine using labels:
```
echo &#039;role{role=&quot;application_server&quot;} 1&#039; &gt; /path/to/directory/role.prom.$$
mv /path/to/directory/role.prom.$$ /path/to/directory/role.prom
```

### Filtering enabled collectors

The `node_exporter` will expose all metrics from enabled collectors by default.  This is the recommended way to collect metrics to avoid errors when comparing metrics of different families.

For advanced use the `node_exporter` can be passed an optional list of collectors to filter metrics. The parameters `collect[]` and `exclude[]` can be used multiple times (but cannot be combined).  In Prometheus configuration you can use this syntax under the [scrape config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#&lt;scrape_config&gt;).

Collect only `cpu` and `meminfo` collector metrics:
```
  params:
    collect[]:
      - cpu
      - meminfo
```

Collect all enabled collector metrics but exclude `netdev`:
```
  params:
    exclude[]:
      - netdev
```

This can be useful for having different Prometheus servers collect specific metrics from nodes.
