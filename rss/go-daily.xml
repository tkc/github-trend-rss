&lt;/div&gt;

Prometheus, a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics
from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,
displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

The features that distinguish Prometheus from other metrics and monitoring systems are:

* A **multi-dimensional** data model (time series defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)
* PromQL, a **powerful and flexible query language** to leverage this dimensionality
* No dependency on distributed storage; **single server nodes are autonomous**
* An HTTP **pull model** for time series collection
* **Pushing time series** is supported via an intermediary gateway for batch jobs
* Targets are discovered via **service discovery** or **static configuration**
* Multiple modes of **graphing and dashboarding support**
* Support for hierarchical and horizontal **federation**

## Architecture overview

![Architecture overview](documentation/images/architecture.svg)

## Install

There are various ways of installing Prometheus.

### Precompiled binaries

Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the
[*download* section](https://prometheus.io/download/)
on [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io). Using the latest production release binary
is the recommended way of installing Prometheus.
See the [Installing](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/install/)
chapter in the documentation for all the details.

### Docker images

Docker images are available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/).

You can launch a Prometheus container for trying it out with

```bash
docker run --name prometheus -d -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```

Prometheus will now be reachable at &lt;http://localhost:9090/&gt;.

### Building from source

To build Prometheus from source code, You need:

* Go: Version specified in [go.mod](./go.mod) or greater.
* NodeJS: Version specified in [.nvmrc](./web/ui/.nvmrc) or greater.
* npm: Version 10 or greater (check with `npm --version` and [here](https://www.npmjs.com/)).

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus.git
cd prometheus
```

You can use the `go` tool to build and install the `prometheus`
and `promtool` binaries into your `GOPATH`:

```bash
go install github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/...
prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml
```

*However*, when using `go install` to build Prometheus, Prometheus will expect to be able to
read its web assets from local filesystem directories under `web/ui/static`. In order for
these assets to be found, you will have to run Prometheus from the root of the cloned
repository. Note also that this directory does not include the React UI unless it has been
built explicitly using `make assets` or `make build`.

An example of the above configuration file can be found [here.](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml)

You can also build using `make build`, which will compile in the web assets so that
Prometheus can be run from anywhere:

```bash
make build
./prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml
```

The Makefile provides several targets:

* *build*: build the `prometheus` and `promtool` binaries (includes building and compiling in web assets)
* *test*: run the tests
* *test-short*: run the short tests
* *format*: format the source code
* *vet*: check the source code for common errors
* *assets*: build the React UI

### Service discovery plugins

Prometheus is bundled with many service discovery plugins.
When building Prometheus from source, you can edit the [plugins.yml](./plugins.yml)
file to disable some service discoveries. The file is a yaml-formatted list of go
import path that will be built into the Prometheus binary.

After you have changed the file, you
need to run `make build` again.

If you are using another method to compile Prometheus, `make plugins` will
generate the plugins file accordingly.

If you add out-of-tree plugins, which we do not endorse at the moment,
additional steps might be needed to adjust the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. As
always, be extra careful when loading third party code.

### Building the Docker image

You can build a docker image locally with the following commands:

```bash
make promu
promu crossbuild -p linux/amd64
make npm_licenses
make common-docker-amd64
```

The `make docker` target is intended only for use in our CI system and will not
produce a fully working image when run locally.

## Using Prometheus as a Go Library

### Remote Write

We are publishing our Remote Write protobuf independently at
[buf.build](https://buf.build/prometheus/prometheus/assets).

You can use that as a library:

```shell
go get buf.build/gen/go/prometheus/prometheus/protocolbuffers/go@latest
```

This is experimental.

### Prometheus code base

In order to comply with [go mod](https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions) rules,
Prometheus release number do not exactly match Go module releases.

For the
Prometheus v3.y.z releases, we are publishing equivalent v0.3y.z tags. The y in v0.3y.z is always padded to two digits, with a leading zero if needed.

Therefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v3.0.0 as a library could do:

```shell
go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.300.0
```

For the
Prometheus v2.y.z releases, we published the equivalent v0.y.z tags.

Therefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v2.35.0 as a library could do:

```shell
go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.35.0
```

This solution makes it clear that we might break our internal Go APIs between
minor user-facing releases, as [breaking changes are allowed in major version
zero](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

## React UI Development

For more information on building, running, and developing on the React-based UI, see the React app&#039;s [README.md](web/ui/README.md).

## More information

* Godoc documentation is available via [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/prometheus). Due to peculiarities of Go Modules, v3.y.z will be displayed as v0.3y.z (the y in v0.3y.z is always padded to two digits, with a leading zero if needed), while v2.y.z will be displayed as v0.y.z.
* See the [Community page](https://prometheus.io/community) for how to reach the Prometheus developers and users on various communication channels.

&lt;img alt=&quot;Harbor&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goharbor/website/master/docs/img/readme/harbor_logo.png&quot;&gt;

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.

Harbor is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of cloud native technologies, consider joining the CNCF. For details about whose involved and how Harbor plays a role, read the CNCF
[announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/).

## Features

* **Cloud native registry**: With support for both container images and [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts, Harbor serves as registry for cloud native environments like container runtimes and orchestration platforms.
* **Role based access control**: Users access different repositories through &#039;projects&#039; and a user can have different permission for images or Helm charts under a project.
* **Policy based replication**: Images and charts can be replicated (synchronized) between multiple registry instances based on policies with using filters (repository, tag and label). Harbor automatically retries a replication if it encounters any errors. This can be used to assist loadbalancing, achieve high availability, and facilitate multi-datacenter deployments in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Harbor scans images regularly for vulnerabilities and has policy checks to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed.
* **LDAP/AD support**: Harbor integrates with existing enterprise LDAP/AD for user authentication and management, and supports importing LDAP groups into Harbor that can then be given permissions to specific projects.
* **OIDC support**: Harbor leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) to verify the identity of users authenticated by an external authorization server or identity provider. Single sign-on can be enabled to log into the Harbor portal.
* **Image deletion &amp; garbage collection**: System admin can run garbage collection jobs so that images(dangling manifests and unreferenced blobs) can be deleted and their space can be freed up periodically.
* **Notary**: Support signing container images using Docker Content Trust (leveraging Notary) for guaranteeing authenticity and provenance.  In addition, policies that prevent unsigned images from being deployed can also be activated.
* **Graphical user portal**: User can easily browse, search repositories and manage projects.
* **Auditing**: All the operations to the repositories are tracked through logs.
* **RESTful API**: RESTful APIs are provided to facilitate administrative operations, and are easy to use for integration with external systems. An embedded Swagger UI is available for exploring and testing the API.
* **Easy deployment**: Harbor can be deployed via Docker compose as well Helm Chart, and a Harbor Operator was added recently as well.

## Architecture

For learning the architecture design of Harbor, check the document [Architecture Overview of Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Architecture-Overview-of-Harbor).

## API

* Harbor RESTful API: The APIs for most administrative operations of Harbor and can be used to perform integrations with Harbor programmatically.
  * Part 1: [New or changed APIs](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goharbor/harbor/main/api/v2.0/swagger.yaml)

# Loki: like Prometheus, but for logs.

Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate.
It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

Compared to other log aggregation systems, Loki:

- does not do full text indexing on logs. By storing compressed, unstructured logs and only indexing metadata, Loki is simpler to operate and cheaper to run.
- indexes and groups log streams using the same labels you’re already using with Prometheus, enabling you to seamlessly switch between metrics and logs using the same labels that you’re already using with Prometheus.
- is an especially good fit for storing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Pod logs. Metadata such as Pod labels is automatically scraped and indexed.
- has native support in Grafana (needs Grafana v6.0).

A Loki-based logging stack consists of 3 components:

- [Alloy](https://github.com/grafana/alloy) is agent, responsible for gathering logs and sending them to Loki.
- [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) is the main service, responsible for storing logs and processing queries.
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) for querying and displaying the logs.

**Note that Alloy replaced Promtail in the stack, because Promtail is considered to be feature complete, and future development for logs collection will be in [Grafana Alloy](https://github.com/grafana/alloy).**

Loki is like Prometheus, but for logs: we prefer a multidimensional label-based approach to indexing, and want a single-binary, easy to operate system with no dependencies.
Loki differs from Prometheus by focusing on logs instead of metrics, and delivering logs via push, instead of pull.

### Building from source

Loki can be run in a single host, no-dependencies mode using the following commands.

You need an up-to-date version of [Go](https://go.dev/), we recommend using the version found in our [Makefile](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/Makefile)

```bash
# Checkout source code
$ git clone https://github.com/grafana/loki
$ cd loki

# Build binary
$ go build ./cmd/loki

# Run executable
$ ./loki -config.file=./cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
```

Alternatively, on Unix systems you can use `make` to build the binary, which adds additional arguments to the `go build` command.

```bash
# Build binary
$ make loki

# Run executable
$ ./cmd/loki/loki -config.file=./cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
```

To build Promtail on non-Linux platforms, use the following command:

```bash
$ go build ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

On Linux, Promtail requires the systemd headers to be installed if
Journal support is enabled.
To enable Journal support the go build tag flag `promtail_journal_enabled` should be passed

With Journal support on Ubuntu, run with the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt install -y libsystemd-dev
$ go build --tags=promtail_journal_enabled ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

With Journal support on CentOS, run with the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo yum install -y systemd-devel
$ go build --tags=promtail_journal_enabled ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

Otherwise, to build Promtail without Journal support, run `go build`
with CGO disabled:

```bash
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

![Moby Project logo](docs/static_files/moby-project-logo.png &quot;The Moby Project&quot;)

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.

It provides a &quot;Lego set&quot; of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.

## Principles

Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set its direction.

- Modular: the project includes lots of components that have well-defined functions and APIs that work together.
- Batteries included but swappable: Moby includes enough components to build fully featured container systems, but its modular architecture ensures that most of the components can be swapped by different implementations.
- Usable security: Moby provides secure defaults without compromising usability.
- Developer focused: The APIs are intended to be functional and useful to build powerful tools.
They are not necessarily intended as end user tools but as components aimed at developers.
Documentation and UX is aimed at developers not end users.

## Audience

The Moby Project is intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent and build systems based on containers.
It is not for people looking for a commercially supported system, but for people who want to work and learn with open source code.

## Relationship with Docker

The components and tools in the Moby Project are initially the open source components that Docker and the community have built for the Docker Project.
New projects can be added if they fit with the community goals. Docker is committed to using Moby as the upstream for the Docker Product.
However, other projects are also encouraged to use Moby as an upstream, and to reuse the components in diverse ways, and all these uses will be treated in the same way. External maintainers and contributors are welcomed.

The Moby project is not intended as a location for support or feature requests for Docker products, but as a place for contributors to work on open source code, fix bugs, and make the code more useful.
The releases are supported by the maintainers, community and users, on a best efforts basis only. For customers who want enterprise or commercial support, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/) are the appropriate products for these use cases.

Istio is an open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. Istio’s powerful features provide a uniform and more efficient way to secure, connect, and monitor services. Istio is the path to load balancing, service-to-service authentication, and monitoring – with few or no service code changes.

## Introduction

[Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/) is an open platform for providing a uniform way to [integrate
microservices](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/microservices-istio/), manage [traffic flow](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/) across microservices, enforce policies
and aggregate telemetry data. Istio&#039;s control plane provides an abstraction
layer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes.

Istio is composed of these components:

- **Envoy** - Sidecar proxies per microservice to handle ingress/egress traffic
   between services in the cluster and from a service to external
   services. The proxies form a _secure microservice mesh_ providing a rich
   set of functions like discovery, rich layer-7 routing, circuit breakers,
   policy enforcement and telemetry recording/reporting
   functions.

  &gt; Note: The service mesh is not an overlay network. It
  &gt; simplifies and enhances how microservices in an application talk to each
  &gt; other over the network provided by the underlying platform.

* **Ztunnel** - A lightweight data plane proxy written in Rust,
    used in Ambient mesh mode to provide secure connectivity and observability for workloads without sidecar proxies.

- **Istiod** - The Istio control plane. It provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management.

## Repositories

The Istio project is divided across a few GitHub repositories:

- [istio/api](https://github.com/istio/api). This repository defines
component-level APIs and common configuration formats for the Istio platform.

- [istio/community](https://github.com/istio/community). This repository contains
information on the Istio community, including the various documents that govern
the Istio open source project.

- [istio/istio](README.md). This is the main code repository. It hosts Istio&#039;s
core components, install artifacts, and sample programs. It includes:

    - [istioctl](istioctl/). This directory contains code for the
[_istioctl_](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/) command line utility.

    - [pilot](pilot/). This directory
contains platform-specific code to populate the
[abstract service model](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#pilot), dynamically reconfigure the proxies
when the application topology changes, as well as translate
[routing rules](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/) into proxy specific configuration.

    - [security](security/). This directory contains [security](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/) related code.

- [istio/proxy](https://github.com/istio/proxy). The Istio proxy contains
extensions to the [Envoy proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) (in the form of
Envoy filters) that support authentication, authorization, and telemetry collection.

- [istio/ztunnel](https://github.com/istio/ztunnel). The repository contains the Rust implementation of the ztunnel
component of Ambient mesh.

- [istio/client-go](https://github.com/istio/client-go). This repository defines
  auto-generated Kubernetes clients for interacting with Istio resources programmatically.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Only the `istio/api` and `istio/client-go` repositories expose stable interfaces intended for direct usage as libraries.

## Issue management

We use GitHub to track all of our bugs and feature requests. Each issue we track has a variety of metadata:

- **Epic**. An epic represents a feature area for Istio as a whole. Epics are fairly broad in scope and are basically product-level things.
Each issue is ultimately part of an epic.

- **Milestone**. Each issue is assigned a milestone. This is 0.1, 0.2, ..., or &#039;Nebulous Future&#039;. The milestone indicates when we
think the issue should get addressed.

- **Priority**. Each issue has a priority which is represented by the column in the [Prioritization](https://github.com/orgs/istio/projects/6) project. Priority can be one of
P0, P1, P2, or &gt;P2. The priority indicates how important it is to address the issue within the milestone. P0 says that the
milestone cannot be considered achieved if the issue isn&#039;t resolved.

## Elevator Pitch

Minor rant incoming: Something&#039;s not working? Maybe a service is down. `docker-compose ps`. Yep, it&#039;s that microservice that&#039;s still buggy. No issue, I&#039;ll just restart it: `docker-compose restart`. Okay now let&#039;s try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. `docker-compose ps`. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with `docker compose logs --follow myservice` but that dies everytime the service dies so I&#039;d need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run `docker-compose up myservice` and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just `up` it again, but now I&#039;ve got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do `ctrl+P,Q`, but... wait, that&#039;s not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can&#039;t remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service.

What a headache!

Memorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible. What if you had all the information you needed in one terminal window with every common command living one keypress away (and the ability to add custom commands as well). Lazydocker&#039;s goal is to make that dream a reality.

- Docker-Compose &gt;= **1.23.2** (optional)

## Installation

### Homebrew

Normally `lazydocker` formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you to tap our formula to get frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too.

**Tap**:
```sh
brew install jesseduffield/lazydocker/lazydocker
```

**Core**:
```sh
brew install lazydocker
```

### Scoop (Windows)

You can install `lazydocker` using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```sh
scoop install lazydocker
```
### Chocolatey (Windows)

You can install `lazydocker` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```sh
choco install lazydocker
```
### asdf-vm

You can install [asdf-lazydocker plugin](https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker) using [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/):
#### Setup (Once)
```sh
asdf plugin add lazydocker https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker.git
```

#### For Install / Upgrade
```sh
asdf list all lazydocker
asdf install lazydocker latest
asdf global lazydocker latest
```

### Binary Release (Linux/OSX/Windows)

You can manually download a binary release from [the release page](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/releases).

Automated install/update, don&#039;t forget to always verify what you&#039;re piping into bash:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/master/scripts/install_update_linux.sh | bash
```
The script installs downloaded binary to `$HOME/.local/bin` directory by default, but it can be changed by setting `DIR` environment variable.

### Go

Required Go Version &gt;= **1.19**

```sh
go install github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker@latest
```

Required Go version &gt;= **1.8**, &lt;= **1.17**

```sh
go get github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker
```

### Arch Linux AUR

You can install lazydocker using the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazydocker) by running:

```sh
yay -S lazydocker
```

### Docker

1. &lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Click if you have an ARM device&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    - If you have a ARM 32 bit v6 architecture

        ```sh
        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm32v6/golang \
        --build-arg GOARCH=arm \
        --build-arg GOARM=6 \
        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
        ```

    - If you have a ARM 32 bit v7 architecture

        ```sh
        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm32v7/golang \
        --build-arg GOARCH=arm \
        --build-arg GOARM=7 \
        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
        ```

    - If you have a ARM 64 bit v8 architecture

        ```sh
        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm64v8/golang \
        --build-arg GOARCH=arm64 \
        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
        ```

    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

1. Run the container

    ```sh
    docker run --rm -it -v \
    /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /yourpath:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker \
    lazyteam/lazydocker
    ```

    - Don&#039;t forget to change `/yourpath` to an actual path you created to store lazydocker&#039;s config
    - You can also use this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
    - You might want to create an alias, for example:

        ```sh
        echo &quot;alias lzd=&#039;docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /yourpath/config:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker lazyteam/lazydocker&#039;&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
        ```



For development, you can build the image using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
cd lazydocker
docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
    --build-arg BUILD_DATE=`date -u +&quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ&quot;` \
    --build-arg VCS_REF=`git rev-parse --short HEAD` \
    --build-arg VERSION=`git describe --abbrev=0 --tag` \
    .
```

If you encounter a compatibility issue with Docker bundled binary, try rebuilding
the image with the build argument `--build-arg DOCKER_VERSION=&quot;v$(docker -v | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev)&quot;`
so that the bundled docker binary matches your host docker binary version.

### Manual

You&#039;ll need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

```
git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
cd lazydocker
go install
```

You can also use `go run main.go` to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)

## Usage

Call `lazydocker` in your terminal. I personally use this a lot so I&#039;ve made an alias for it like so:

```
echo &quot;alias lzd=&#039;lazydocker&#039;&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

(you can substitute .zshrc for whatever rc file you&#039;re using)

- Basic video tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/NICqQPxwJWw).
- List of keybindings
  [here](/docs/keybindings).

## Cool features

everything is one keypress away (or one click away! Mouse support FTW):

- viewing the state of your docker or docker-compose container environment at a glance
- viewing logs for a container/service
- viewing ascii graphs of your containers&#039; metrics so that you can not only feel but also look like a developer
- customising

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to
receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need
to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support
open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to
multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

Objectives:

- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.
- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.
- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.
- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.
- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.

## Community

The OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)
channel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via
video calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:

- meet the humans behind the project
- get an opinion about specific proposals
- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack
- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously

We rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to
allow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:

Tuesday:

- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)

Wednesday:

- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)
- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)

Contributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.
Post a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong
reasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to
identify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.

Remember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the
relevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull
request where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous
calls and don&#039;t want them to feel excluded.

## Supported OTLP version

This code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,
considered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability
definition
here.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)

## Stability levels

See [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.

## Compatibility

When used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.

Support for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:

1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.
2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.

Official OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.

## Verifying the images signatures

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.

We are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:

```console
$ cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt; \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  &lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;
```

where:

- `&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt;`: is the release that you want to validate
- `&lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;`: is the image that you want to check

Example:

```console
$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0

Verification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates

&lt;div markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/) (1.24 or higher)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (20 LTS or higher with npm)
- [Wails v3](https://v3alpha.wails.io/getting-started/installation/) CLI

**Platform-specific requirements:**

- **Linux**: GTK3, WebKit2GTK 4.1, libsoup 3.0, GCC, pkg-config
- **Windows**: MinGW-w64 (for CGO support), NSIS (for installers)
- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools

For detailed installation instructions, see [Build Requirements](docs/BUILD_REQUIREMENTS.md)

```bash
# Quick setup for Linux (Ubuntu 24.04+):
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libsoup-3.0-dev gcc pkg-config
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WCY-dt/MrRSS.git
   cd MrRSS
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Install Wails v3 CLI**

   ```bash
   go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest
   ```

4. **Build the application**

   ```bash
   # Using Task (recommended)
   task build

   # Or using Makefile
   make build

   # Or directly with wails3
   wails3 build
   ```

   The executable will be created in the `build/bin` directory.

5. **Run the application**

   - Windows: `build/bin/MrRSS.exe`
   - macOS: `build/bin/MrRSS.app`

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/MrRSS/`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/MrRSS/`

**Portable Mode** (when `portable.txt` exists):

- All data stored in `data/` folder

This ensures your data persists across application updates and reinstalls.

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Run full check (lint + test + build)
make check

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Setup development environment
make setup
```

#### Using Scripts

Cross-platform scripts are available in the `scripts/` directory:

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
# Run all checks
./scripts/check.sh

# Pre-release checks
./scripts/pre-release.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Run all checks
.\scripts\check.ps1

# Pre-release checks
.\scripts\pre-release.ps1
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

# Lima: Linux Machines

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/lima-vm/lima)
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/6505/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/6505)
[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/lima-vm/lima/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/lima-vm/lima)

[Lima](https://lima-vm.io/) launches Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing and port forwarding (similar to WSL2).

The original goal of Lima was to promote [containerd](https://containerd.io) including [nerdctl (contaiNERD ctl)](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)
to Mac users, but Lima can be used for non-container applications as well.

Lima also supports other container engines (Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, etc.) and non-macOS hosts (Linux, NetBSD, etc.).

## Getting started
Set up (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install lima
limactl start
```

To run Linux commands:
```bash
lima uname -a
```

To run containers with containerd:
```bash
lima nerdctl run --rm hello-world
```

To run containers with Docker:
```bash
limactl start template://docker
export DOCKER_HOST=$(limactl list docker --format &#039;unix://{{.Dir}}/sock/docker.sock&#039;)
docker run --rm hello-world
```

To run containers with Kubernetes:
```bash
limactl start template://k8s
export KUBECONFIG=$(limactl list k8s --format &#039;unix://{{.Dir}}/copied-from-guest/kubeconfig.yaml&#039;)
kubectl apply -f ...
```

## Installation

Use a package manager:

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install charmbracelet/tap/crush

# NPM
npm install -g @charmland/crush

# Arch Linux (btw)
yay -S crush-bin

# Nix
nix run github:numtide/nix-ai-tools#crush
```

Windows users:

```bash
# Winget
winget install charmbracelet.crush

# Scoop
scoop bucket add charm https://github.com/charmbracelet/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install crush
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nix (NUR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Crush is available via [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) in `nur.repos.charmbracelet.crush`.

You can also try out Crush via `nix-shell`:

```bash
# Add the NUR channel.
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/main.tar.gz nur
nix-channel --update

# Get Crush in a Nix shell.
nix-shell -p &#039;(import &lt;nur&gt; { pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}; }).repos.charmbracelet.crush&#039;
```

### NixOS &amp; Home Manager Module Usage via NUR

Crush provides NixOS and Home Manager modules via NUR.
You can use these modules directly in your flake by importing them from NUR. Since it auto detects whether its a home manager or nixos context you can use the import the exact same way :)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nur.url = &quot;github:nix-community/NUR&quot;;
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nur, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
      modules = [
        nur.modules.nixos.default
        nur.repos.charmbracelet.modules.crush
        {
          programs.crush = {
            enable = true;
            settings = {
              providers = {
                openai = {
                  id = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  name = &quot;OpenAI&quot;;
                  base_url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1&quot;;
                  type = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  api_key = &quot;sk-fake123456789abcdef...&quot;;
                  models = [
                    {
                      id = &quot;gpt-4&quot;;
                      name = &quot;GPT-4&quot;;
                    }
                  ];
                };
              };
              lsp = {
                go = { command = &quot;gopls&quot;; enabled = true; };
                nix = { command = &quot;nil&quot;; enabled = true; };
              };
              options = {
                context_paths = [ &quot;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&quot; ];
                tui = { compact_mode = true; };
                debug = false;
              };
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora/RHEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash

&gt; Productivity may increase when using Crush and you may find yourself nerd
&gt; sniped when first using the application. If the symptoms persist, join the
&gt; [Discord][discord] and nerd snipe the rest of us.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, or OpenRouter and just start
Crush. You&#039;ll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

| Environment Variable        | Provider                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`         | Anthropic                                          |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`            | OpenAI                                             |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`        | OpenRouter                                         |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`            | Google Gemini                                      |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`          | Cerebras                                           |
| `HF_TOKEN`                  | Huggingface Inference                              |
| `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`          | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `VERTEXAI_LOCATION`         | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`              | Groq                                               |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`         | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`     | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_REGION`                | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_PROFILE`               | Amazon Bedrock (Custom Profile)                       |
| `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`  | Amazon Bedrock                                        |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI models                                |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`      | Azure OpenAI models (optional when using Entra ID) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`  | Azure OpenAI models                                |

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Catwalk Badge&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  &quot;this-setting&quot;: { &quot;this&quot;: &quot;that&quot; },
  &quot;that-setting&quot;: [&quot;ceci&quot;, &quot;cela&quot;]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can override the user and data config locations by setting:
&gt; * `CRUSH_GLOBAL_CONFIG`
&gt; * `CRUSH_GLOBAL_DATA`

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;lsp&quot;: {
    &quot;go&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gopls&quot;,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GOTOOLCHAIN&quot;: &quot;go1.24.5&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;typescript&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;typescript-language-server&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;--stdio&quot;]
    },
    &quot;nix&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nil&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/mcp-server.js&quot;],
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [&quot;some-tool-name&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NODE_ENV&quot;: &quot;production&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [&quot;create_issue&quot;, &quot;create_pull_request&quot;],
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer $GH_PAT&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;streaming-service&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/sse&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;API-Key&quot;: &quot;$(echo $API_KEY)&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don&#039;t want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you&#039;d like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allowed_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;view&quot;,
      &quot;ls&quot;,
      &quot;grep&quot;,
      &quot;edit&quot;,
      &quot;mcp_context7_get-library-doc&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Disabling Built-In Tools

If you&#039;d like to prevent Crush from using certain built-in tools entirely, you
can disable them via the `options.disabled_tools` list. Disabled tools are
completely hidden from the agent.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disabled_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;bash&quot;,
      &quot;sourcegraph&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

To disable tools from MCP servers, see the [MCP config section](#mcps).

### Agent Skills

Crush supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard for
extending agent capabilities with reusable skill packages. Skills are folders
containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that Crush can discover and
activate on demand.

Skills are discovered from:

- `~/.config/crush/skills/` on Unix (default, can be overridden with `CRUSH_SKILLS_DIR`)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\skills\` on Windows (default, can be overridden with `CRUSH_SKILLS_DIR`)
- Additional paths configured via `options.skills_paths`

```jsonc
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;skills_paths&quot;: [
      &quot;~/.config/crush/skills&quot;, // Windows: &quot;%LOCALAPPDATA%\\crush\\skills&quot;,
      &quot;./project-skills&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

You can get started with example skills from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills):

```bash
# Unix
mkdir -p ~/.config/crush/skills
cd ~/.config/crush/skills
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git _temp
mv _temp/skills/* . &amp;&amp; rm -rf _temp
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
mkdir -Force &quot;$env:LOCALAPPDATA\crush\skills&quot;
cd &quot;$env:LOCALAPPDATA\crush\skills&quot;
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git _temp
mv _temp/skills/* . ; rm -r -force _temp
```

### Initialization

When you initialize a project, Crush analyzes your codebase and creates
a context file that helps it work more effectively in future sessions.
By default, this file is named `AGENTS.md`, but you can customize the
name and location with the `initialize_as` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;initialize_as&quot;: &quot;AGENTS.md&quot;
  }
}
```

This is useful if you prefer a different naming convention or want to
place the file in a specific directory (e.g., `CRUSH.md` or
`docs/LLMs.md`). Crush will fill the file with project-specific context
like build commands, code patterns, and conventions it discovered during
initialization.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;attribution&quot;: {
      &quot;trailer_style&quot;: &quot;co-authored-by&quot;,
      &quot;generated_with&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

- `trailer_style`: Controls the attribution trailer added to commit messages
  (default: `assisted-by`)
	- `assisted-by`: Adds `Assisted-by: [Model Name] via Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	  (includes the model name)
	- `co-authored-by`: Adds `Co-Authored-By: Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	- `none`: No attribution trailer
- `generated_with`: When true (default), adds `💘 Generated with Crush` line to
  commit messages and PR descriptions

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Note that we support two &quot;types&quot; for OpenAI. Make sure to choose the right one
&gt; to ensure the best experience!
&gt; * `openai` should be used when proxying or routing requests through OpenAI.
&gt; * `openai-compat` should be used when using non-OpenAI providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don&#039;t forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;deepseek&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deepseek V3&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 0.27,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 0.07,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 64000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;custom-anthropic&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anthropic&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.anthropic.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;extra_headers&quot;: {
        &quot;anthropic-version&quot;: &quot;2023-06-01&quot;
      },
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Claude Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`
- Alternatively to `aws configure`, you can also just set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;vertexai&quot;: {
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4@20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VertexAI Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;ollama&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ollama&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen3:30b&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;lmstudio&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;LM Studio&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:1234/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;debug&quot;: true,
    &quot;debug_lsp&quot;: true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_provider_auto_update&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom

## Ballad of asdf

&gt; Once upon a time there was a programming language&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; There were many versions of it&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; So people wrote a version manager for it&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; To switch between versions for projects&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Different, old, new.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there came more programming languages&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; So there came more version managers&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; And many commands for them
&gt; 
&gt; I installed a lot of them&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; I learnt a lot of commands
&gt; 
&gt; Then I said, just one more version manager&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Which I will write instead
&gt; 
&gt; So, there came another version manager&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; **asdf version manager** - &lt;https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; A version manager so extendable&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; for which anyone can create a plugin&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; To support their favourite language&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; No more installing more version managers&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Or learning more commands

![Crossplane](banner.png)

Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
needing to write code. It has a highly extensible backend that enables you to
build a control plane that can orchestrate applications and infrastructure no
matter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend that puts you in
control of the schema of the declarative API it offers.

Crossplane is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][cncf] project.

## Get Started

Crossplane&#039;s [Get Started Docs] covers install and resource quickstarts.

## Roadmap

The public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues
added to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the
community, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.

The maintainer team regularly triages requests from the community to identify
features and issues of suitable scope and impact to include in this roadmap. The
community is encouraged to show their support for potential roadmap issues by
adding a :+1: reaction, leaving descriptive comments, and attending the
[regular community meetings] to discuss their requirements and use cases.

The maintainer team updates the roadmap on an as needed basis, in response to
demand, priority, and available resources. The public roadmap can be updated at
any time.

Milestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of
overall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered
approximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific
delivery timeline.

* **NFS-based storages**: Supports storing data on NFS-based storages such as Amazon EFS, Google Filestore.
* And many other features such as metrics relabeling, cardinality limiter, etc.

## Enterprise version

In addition, the Enterprise version includes extra features:

- **Anomaly detection**: Automation and simplification of your alerting rules, covering complex anomalies found in metrics data.
- **Backup automation**: Automates regular backup procedures.
- **Multiple retentions**: Reducing storage costs by specifying different retentions for different datasets.
- **Downsampling**: Reducing storage costs and increasing performance for queries over historical data.
- **Stable releases** with long-term support lines ([LTS](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/lts-releases/)).
- **Comprehensive support**: First-class consulting, feature requests and technical support provided by the core VictoriaMetrics dev team.

## Benchmarks 

Some good benchmarks VictoriaMetrics achieved:

* **Minimal memory footprint**: handling millions of unique timeseries with [10x less RAM](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) than InfluxDB, up to [7x less RAM](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Highly scalable and performance** for [data ingestion](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and [querying](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4), [20x outperforms](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.
* **High data compression**: [70x more data points](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4) may be stored into limited storage than TimescaleDB, [7x less storage](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) space is required than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Reducing storage costs**: [10x more effective](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/casestudies/#grammarly) than Graphite according to the Grammarly case study.
* **A single-node VictoriaMetrics** can replace medium-sized clusters built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. See [VictoriaMetrics vs Thanos](https://medium.com/@valyala/comparing-thanos-to-victoriametrics-cluster-b193bea1683), [Measuring vertical scalability](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae), [Remote write storage wars - PromCon 2019](https://promcon.io/2019-munich/talks/remote-write-storage-wars/).
* **Optimized for storage**: [Works well with high-latency IO](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and low IOPS (HDD and network storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.).
