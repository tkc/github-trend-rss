## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

## What is gVisor?

**gVisor** provides a strong layer of isolation between running applications and
the host operating system. It is an application kernel that implements a
[Linux-like interface][linux]. Unlike Linux, it is written in a memory-safe
language (Go) and runs in userspace.

gVisor includes an [Open Container Initiative (OCI)][oci] runtime called `runsc`
that makes it easy to work with existing container tooling. The `runsc` runtime
integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, making it simple to run sandboxed
containers.

## What **isn&#039;t** gVisor?

*   gVisor is **not a syscall filter** (e.g. `seccomp-bpf`), nor a wrapper over
    Linux isolation primitives (e.g. `firejail`, AppArmor, etc.).
*   gVisor is also **not a VM** in the everyday sense of the term (e.g.
    VirtualBox, QEMU).

**gVisor takes a distinct third approach**, providing many security benefits of
VMs while maintaining the lower resource footprint, fast startup, and
flexibility of regular userspace applications.

## Why does gVisor exist?

Containers are not a [**sandbox**][sandbox]. While containers have
revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications, using them to
run untrusted or potentially malicious code without additional isolation is not
a good idea. While using a single, shared kernel allows for efficiency and
performance gains, it also means that container escape is possible with a single
vulnerability.

gVisor is an application kernel for containers. It limits the host kernel
surface accessible to the application while still giving the application access
to all the features it expects. Unlike most kernels, gVisor does not assume or
require a fixed set of physical resources; instead, it leverages existing host
kernel functionality and runs as a normal process. In other words, gVisor
implements Linux by way of Linux.

gVisor should not be confused with technologies and tools to harden containers
against external threats, provide additional integrity checks, or limit the
scope of access for a service. One should always be careful about what data is
made available to a container.

## Documentation

User documentation and technical architecture, including quick start guides, can
be found at [gvisor.dev][gvisor-dev].

## Installing from source

gVisor builds on x86_64 and ARM64. Other architectures may become available in
the future.

For the purposes of these instructions, [bazel][bazel] and other build
dependencies are wrapped in a build container. It is possible to use
[bazel][bazel] directly, or type `make help` for standard targets.

### Requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

*   Linux 4.14.77+ ([older linux][old-linux])
*   [Docker version 17.09.0 or greater][docker]

### Building

Build and install the `runsc` binary:

```sh
mkdir -p bin
make copy TARGETS=runsc DESTINATION=bin/
sudo cp ./bin/runsc /usr/local/bin
```

To build specific libraries or binaries, you can specify the target:

```sh
make build TARGETS=&quot;//pkg/tcpip:tcpip&quot;
```

### Testing

To run standard test suites, you can use:

```sh
make unit-tests
make tests
```

To run specific tests, you can specify the target:

```sh
make test TARGETS=&quot;//runsc:version_test&quot;
```

### Using `go get`

This project uses [bazel][bazel] to build and manage dependencies. A synthetic
`go` branch is maintained that is compatible with standard `go` tooling for
convenience.

For example, to build and install `runsc` directly from this branch:

```sh
echo &quot;module runsc&quot; &gt; go.mod
GO111MODULE=on go get gvisor.dev/gvisor/runsc@go
CGO_ENABLED=0 GO111MODULE=on sudo -E go build -o /usr/local/bin/runsc gvisor.dev/gvisor/runsc
```

Subsequently, you can build and install the shim binary for `containerd`:

```sh
GO111MODULE=on sudo -E go build -o /usr/local/bin/containerd-shim-runsc-v1 gvisor.dev/gvisor/shim
```

Note that this branch is supported in a best effort capacity, and direct
development on this branch is not supported. Development should occur on the
`master` branch, which is then reflected into the `go` branch.

## Community &amp; Governance

See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for project governance information.

The [gvisor-users mailing list][gvisor-users-list] and
[gvisor-dev mailing list][gvisor-dev-list] are good starting points for
questions and discussion.

## Quick Start

Higress can be started with just Docker, making it convenient for individual developers to set up locally for learning or for building simple sites:

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir higress; cd higress
# Start higress, configuration files will be written to the working directory
docker run -d --rm --name higress-ai -v ${PWD}:/data \
        -p 8001:8001 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443  \
        higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/higress/all-in-one:latest
```

Port descriptions:

- Port 8001: Higress UI console entry
- Port 8080: Gateway HTTP protocol entry
- Port 8443: Gateway HTTPS protocol entry

&gt; All Higress Docker images use Higress&#039;s own image repository and are not affected by Docker Hub rate limits.
&gt; In addition, the submission and updates of the images are protected by a security scanning mechanism (powered by Alibaba Cloud ACR), making them very secure for use in production environments.

For other installation methods such as Helm deployment under K8s, please refer to the official [Quick Start documentation](https://higress.io/en-us/docs/user/quickstart).

## Introduction

Temporal is a durable execution platform that enables developers to build scalable applications without sacrificing productivity or reliability.
The Temporal server executes units of application logic called Workflows in a resilient manner that automatically handles intermittent failures, and retries failed operations.

Temporal is a mature technology that originated as a fork of Uber&#039;s Cadence.
It is developed by [Temporal Technologies](https://temporal.io/), a startup by the creators of Cadence.

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

kube-bench is a tool that checks whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the checks documented in the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/).

Tests are configured with YAML files, making this tool easy to update as test specifications evolve.

![Kubernetes Bench for Security](/docs/images/output.png &quot;Kubernetes Bench for Security&quot;)

## CIS Scanning as part of Trivy and the Trivy Operator

[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), the all in one cloud native security scanner, can be deployed as a [Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) inside a cluster.
Both, the [Trivy CLI](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), and the [Trivy Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) support CIS Kubernetes Benchmark scanning among several other features.

## Quick start

There are multiple ways to run kube-bench.
You can run kube-bench inside a pod, but it will need access to the host&#039;s PID namespace in order to check the running processes, as well as access to some directories on the host where config files and other files are stored.

The supplied `job.yaml` [file](job.yaml) can be applied to run the tests as a job. For example:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f job.yaml
job.batch/kube-bench created

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
kube-bench-j76s9   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          3s

# Wait for a few seconds for the job to complete
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kube-bench-j76s9   0/1     Completed   0          11s

# The results are held in the pod&#039;s logs
kubectl logs kube-bench-j76s9
[INFO] 1 Master Node Security Configuration
[INFO] 1.1 API Server
...
```
For more information and different ways to run kube-bench see [documentation](docs/running.md)
### Please Note

1. kube-bench implements the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/) as closely as possible. Please raise issues here if kube-bench is not correctly implementing the test as described in the Benchmark. To report issues in the Benchmark itself (for example, tests that you believe are inappropriate), please join the [CIS community](https://cisecurity.org).

1. There is not a one-to-one mapping between releases of Kubernetes and releases of the CIS benchmark. See [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark support](docs/platforms.md#cis-kubernetes-benchmark-support) to see which releases of Kubernetes are covered by different releases of the benchmark.


By default, kube-bench will determine the test set to run based on the Kubernetes version running on the machine.
- see the following documentation on [Running kube-bench](docs/running.md#running-kube-bench) for more details.


## Contributing
Kindly read [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing. 
We welcome PRs and issue reports.

## Roadmap

Going forward we plan to release updates to kube-bench to add support for new releases of the CIS Benchmark. Note that these are not released as frequently as Kubernetes releases.

Kargo is a next-generation continuous delivery and application lifecycle
orchestration platform for Kubernetes. It builds upon
[GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) principles and integrates with existing
technologies, like [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/), to streamline and
automate the progressive rollout of changes across the many stages of an
application&#039;s lifecycle.

# Q&amp;A

## Q: There are so many streaming server projects in the world，why need to create Monibuca?

A: Monibuca is different from other streaming servers,that it was created for facilitate secondary development.

## Q: Why use golang?

A: Golang is a greate programming language. It is very suited to build streaming server since streaming server is a kind of IO intensive system. Goroutine is good at doing these jobs. Another important reason of using Golang is that people read the source code or doing secondary development easier.

## Q: What does &quot;Monibuca&quot; mean?

A: No special meaning. Just from monica —— a girl name.

## Introduction

Syft is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for container images and filesystems. It provides detailed visibility into the packages and dependencies in your software, helping you manage vulnerabilities, license compliance, and software supply chain security.

Syft development is sponsored by [Anchore](https://anchore.com/), and is released under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file). For commercial support options with Syft or Grype, please [contact Anchore](https://get.anchore.com/contact/).

## Features
- Generates SBOMs for container images, filesystems, archives, and more to discover packages and libraries
- Supports OCI, Docker and [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) image formats
- Linux distribution identification
- Works seamlessly with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) (a fast, modern vulnerability scanner)
- Able to create signed SBOM attestations using the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md)
- Convert between SBOM formats, such as CycloneDX, SPDX, and Syft&#039;s own format.

## Installation

Syft binaries are provided for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Recommended
&gt; ```bash 
&gt; curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
&gt; ```

Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Homebrew
```bash
brew install syft
```

### Scoop

```powershell
scoop install syft
```

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of Syft is community-maintained and not distributed by the Anchore team

```powershell
choco install syft -y
```

### Nix

**Note**: Nix packaging of Syft is [community maintained](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/sy/syft/package.nix). Syft is available in the [stable channel](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_channels#The_official_channels) since NixOS `22.05`.

```bash
nix-env -i syft
```

... or, just try it out in an ephemeral nix shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p syft
```

## Getting started

### SBOM

To generate an SBOM for a container image:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt;
```

The above output includes only software that is visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the SBOM, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

### Output formats

The output format for Syft is configurable as well using the `-o` (or `--output`) option:

```
syft &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the `formats` available are:
- `syft-json`: Use this to get as much information out of Syft as possible!
- `syft-text`: A row-oriented, human-and-machine-friendly output.
- `cyclonedx-xml`: A XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-xml@1.5`: A XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).

## Demo GCP
[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/243961.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/243961)

## Capabilities

1.  Generate `tf`/`json` + `tfstate` files from existing infrastructure for all
    supported objects by resource.
2.  Remote state can be uploaded to a GCS bucket.
3.  Connect between resources with `terraform_remote_state` (local and bucket).
4.  Save `tf`/`json` files using a custom folder tree pattern.
5.  Import by resource name and type.
6.  Support terraform 0.13 (for terraform 0.11 use v0.7.9).

Terraformer uses Terraform providers and is designed to easily support newly added resources.
To upgrade resources with new fields, all you need to do is upgrade the relevant Terraform providers.
```
Import current state to Terraform configuration from a provider

Usage:
   import [provider] [flags]
   import [provider] [command]

Available Commands:
  list        List supported resources for a provider

Flags:
  -b, --bucket string         gs://terraform-state
  -c, --connect                (default true)
  -С, --compact                (default false)
  -x, --excludes strings      firewalls,networks
  -f, --filter strings        compute_firewall=id1:id2:id4
  -h, --help                  help for google
  -O, --output string         output format hcl or json (default &quot;hcl&quot;)
  -o, --path-output string     (default &quot;generated&quot;)
  -p, --path-pattern string   {output}/{provider}/ (default &quot;{output}/{provider}/{service}/&quot;)
      --projects strings
  -z, --regions strings       europe-west1, (default [global])
  -r, --resources strings     firewall,networks or * for all services
  -s, --state string          local or bucket (default &quot;local&quot;)
  -v, --verbose               verbose mode
  -n, --retry-number          number of retries to perform if refresh fails
  -m, --retry-sleep-ms        time in ms to sleep between retries

Use &quot; import [provider] [command] --help&quot; for more information about a command.
```
#### Permissions

The tool requires read-only permissions to list service resources.

#### Resources

You can use `--resources` parameter to tell resources from what service you want to import.

To import resources from all services, use `--resources=&quot;*&quot;` . If you want to exclude certain services, you can combine the parameter with `--excludes` to exclude resources from services you don&#039;t want to import e.g. `--resources=&quot;*&quot; --excludes=&quot;iam&quot;`.

#### Filtering

Filters are a way to choose which resources `terraformer` imports. It&#039;s possible to filter resources by its identifiers or attributes. Multiple filtering values are separated by `:`. If an identifier contains this symbol, value should be wrapped in `&#039;` e.g. `--filter=resource=id1:&#039;project:dataset_id&#039;`. Identifier based filters will be executed before Terraformer will try to refresh remote state.

Use `Type` when you need to filter only one of several types of resources. Multiple filters can be combined when importing different resource types. An example would be importing all AWS security groups from a specific AWS VPC:
```
terraformer import aws -r sg,vpc --filter Type=sg;Name=vpc_id;Value=VPC_ID --filter Type=vpc;Name=id;Value=VPC_ID
```
Notice how the `Name` is different for `sg` than it is for `vpc`.

##### Migration state version
For terraform &gt;= 0.13, you can use `replace-provider` to migrate state from previous versions.

Example usage:
```
terraform state replace-provider -auto-approve &quot;registry.terraform.io/-/aws&quot; &quot;hashicorp/aws&quot;
```

##### Resource ID

Filtering is based on Terraform resource ID patterns. To find valid ID patterns for your resource, check the import part of the [Terraform documentation][terraform-providers].

[terraform-providers]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/

Example usage:

```
terraformer import aws --resources=vpc,subnet --filter=vpc=myvpcid --regions=eu-west-1
```
Will only import the vpc with id `myvpcid`. This form of filters can help when it&#039;s necessary to select resources by its identifiers.

##### Field name only

It is possible to filter by specific field name only. It can be used e.g. when you want to retrieve resources only with a specific tag key.

Example usage:

```
terraformer import aws --resources=s3 --filter=&quot;Name=tags.Abc&quot; --regions=eu-west-1
```
Will only import the s3 resources that have tag `Abc`. This form of filters can help when the field values are not important from filtering perspective.

##### Field with dots

It is possible to filter by a field that contains a dot.

Example usage:

```
terraformer import aws --resources=s3 --filter=&quot;Name=tags.Abc.def&quot; --regions=eu-west-1
```
Will only import the s3 resources that have tag `Abc.def`.

#### Planning

The `plan` command generates a planfile that contains all the resources set to be imported. By modifying the planfile before running the `import` command, you can rename or filter the resources you&#039;d like to import.

The rest of subcommands and parameters are identical to the `import` command.

```
$ terraformer plan google --resources=networks,firewall --projects=my-project --regions=europe-west1-d
(snip)

Saving planfile to generated/google/my-project/terraformer/plan.json
```

After reviewing/customizing the planfile, begin the import by running `import plan`.

```
$ terraformer import plan generated/google/my-project/terraformer/plan.json
```

### Resource structure

Terraformer by default separates each resource into a file, which is put into a given service directory.

The default path for resource files is `{output}/{provider}/{service}/{resource}.tf` and can vary for each provider.

It&#039;s possible to adjust the generated structure by:
1. Using `--compact` parameter to group resource files within a single service into one `resources.tf` file
2. Adjusting the `--path-pattern` parameter and passing e.g. `--path-pattern {output}/{provider}/` to generate resources for all services in one directory

It&#039;s possible to combine `--compact` `--path-pattern` parameters together.

### Installation

Both Terraformer and a Terraform provider plugin need to be installed.

#### Terraformer

**From a package manager**
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install terraformer`.
- [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) users can use `sudo port install terraformer`.
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) users can use `choco install terraformer`.

**From releases**
This installs all providers, set `PROVIDER` to one of `google`, `aws` or `kubernetes` if you only need one.

```
* Windows
1. Install Terraform - https://www.terraform.io/downloads
2. Download exe file for required provider from here - https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer/releases
3. Add the exe file path to path variable

**From source**
1.  Run `git clone &lt;terraformer repo&gt; &amp;&amp; cd terraformer/`
2.  Run `go mod download`
3.  Run `go build -v` for all providers OR build with one provider
`go run build/main.go {google,aws,azure,kubernetes,etc}`

#### Terraform Providers

Create a working folder and initialize the Terraform provider plugin.  This folder will be where you run Terraformer commands.

Run ```terraform init``` against a ```versions.tf``` file to install the plugins required for your platform. For example, if you need plugins for the google provider, ```versions.tf``` should contain:
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source = &quot;hashicorp/google&quot;
    }
  }
  required_version = &quot;&gt;= 0.13&quot;
}
```

Or, copy your Terraform provider&#039;s plugin(s) from the list below to folder `~/.terraform.d/plugins/`, as appropriate.

## High-Level steps to add new provider
 * Initialize provider details in cmd/root.go and create a provider initialization file in the terraformer/cmd folder
 * Create a folder under terraformer/providers/ for your provider
 * Create two files under this folder
   * &lt;provide_name&gt;_provider.go
   * &lt;provide_name&gt;_service.go
* Initialize all provider&#039;s supported services in &lt;provide_name&gt;_provider.go file
* Create script for each supported service in same folder

## Contributing

If you have improvements or fixes, we would love to have your contributions.
Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on the process we would like
contributors to follow.

## Developing

Terraformer was built so you can easily add new providers of any kind.

Process for generating `tf`/`json` + `tfstate` files:

1.  Call GCP/AWS/other api and get list of resources.
2.  Iterate over resources and take only the ID (we don&#039;t need mapping fields!).
3.  Call to provider for readonly fields.
4.  Call to infrastructure and take tf + tfstate.

## Infrastructure

1.  Call to provider using the refresh method and get all data.
2.  Convert refresh data to go struct.
3.  Generate HCL file - `tf`/`json` files.
4.  Generate `tfstate` files.

All mapping of resource is made by providers and Terraform. Upgrades are needed only
for providers.

##### GCP compute resources

For GCP compute resources, use generated code from
`providers/gcp/gcp_compute_code_generator`.

To regenerate code:

```
go run providers/gcp/gcp_compute_code_generator/*.go
```

### Similar projects

#### [terraforming](https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming)

##### Terraformer Benefits

* Simpler to add new providers and resources - already supports AWS, GCP, GitHub, Kubernetes, and Openstack. Terraforming supports only AWS.
* Better support for HCL + tfstate, including updates for Terraform 0.12.
* If a provider adds new attributes to a resource, there is no need change Terraformer code - just update the Terraform provider on your laptop.
* Automatically supports connections between resources in HCL files.

##### Comparison

Terraforming gets all attributes from cloud APIs and creates HCL and tfstate files with templating. Each attribute in the API needs to map to attribute in Terraform. Generated files from templating can be broken with illegal syntax. When a provider adds new attributes the terraforming code needs to be updated.

Terraformer instead uses Terraform provider files for mapping attributes, HCL library from Hashicorp, and Terraform code.

Look for S3 support in terraforming here and official S3 support
Terraforming lacks full coverage for resources - as an example you can see that 70% of S3 options are not supported:

* terraforming - https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming/blob/master/lib/terraforming/template/tf/s3.erb
* official S3 support - https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket

## About

The gRPC-Gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler
[protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).
It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which
translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the
[`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotations in your service definitions.

This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/assets/images/architecture_introduction_diagram.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Docs

You can read our docs at:

- https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/

## Testimonials

&gt; We use the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of API requests per day,
&gt; and have been since 2018 and through all of that,
&gt; we have never had any issues with it.
&gt;
&gt; _- William Mill, [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/)_

## Background

gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming
languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is
combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional
RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining
backward-compatibility, supporting languages or clients that are not well supported by
gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful
JSON architecture.

This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.
A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all
that&#039;s needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.

## Installation

### Compile from source

The following instructions assume you are using
[Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) for dependency
management. Use a
[tool dependency](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
to track the versions of the following executable packages:

```go
// +build tools

package tools

import (
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot;
)
```

Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running

```sh
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### **Using the `tool` Directive in Go 1.24**

Starting from Go 1.24, the `tool` directive in `go.mod` provides a structured way to track and manage executable dependencies. This replaces the previous workaround of using a separate `tools.go` file with blank imports.

#### **Tracking Tools in `go.mod`**

Instead of manually importing tool dependencies in a Go source file, you can now use the `tool` directive in `go.mod` to declare the tools your project depends on. For example:

```go
module tools

go 1.24

tool (
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
	google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
	google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
)
```

#### **Managing Tool Dependencies**

To add tools to your module, use the `-tool` flag with `go get`:

```sh
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
go get -tool google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
go get -tool google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This automatically updates `go.mod`, adding the tools under the `tool` directive along with `require` statements to ensure version tracking.

### Install Tools

Once the tool dependencies are properly recorded in the `go.mod` file, simply execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
go install tool
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### Download the binaries

You may alternatively download the binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
We generate [SLSA3 signatures](slsa.dev) using the OpenSSF&#039;s [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) during the release process. To verify a release binary:

1. Install the verification tool from [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation).
2. Download the provenance file `attestation.intoto.jsonl` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
3. Run the verifier:

```shell
slsa-verifier -artifact-path &lt;the-binary&gt; -provenance attestation.intoto.jsonl -source github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway -tag &lt;the-tag&gt;
```

Alternatively, see the section on remotely managed plugin versions below.

## Usage

### 1.Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers

`your_service.proto`:

```protobuf
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;

 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
   rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
 }
```

### 2. Generate gRPC stubs

This step generates the gRPC stubs that you can use to implement the service and consume from clients:

Here&#039;s an example `buf.gen.yaml` you can use to generate the stubs with [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf):

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

With this file in place, you can generate your files using `buf generate`.

&gt; For a complete example of using `buf generate` to generate protobuf stubs, see
&gt; [the boilerplate repo](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).
&gt; For more information on generating the stubs with buf, see
&gt; [the official documentation](https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage).

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, here&#039;s an example of what a command
might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . \
    --go_out ./gen/go/ --go_opt paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out ./gen/go/ --go-grpc_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 3. Implement your service in gRPC as usual.

### 4. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

At this point, you have 3 options:

- no further modifications, use the default mapping to HTTP semantics (method, path, etc.)
  - this will work on any `.proto` file, but will not allow setting HTTP paths, request parameters or similar
- additional `.proto` modifications to use a custom mapping
  - relies on parameters in the `.proto` file to set custom HTTP mappings
- no `.proto` modifications, but use an external configuration file
  - relies on an external configuration file to set custom HTTP mappings
  - mostly useful when the source proto file isn&#039;t under your control

#### 1. Using the default mapping

This requires no additional modification to the `.proto` file but does require enabling a specific option when executing the plugin.
The `generate_unbound_methods` should be enabled.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt generate_unbound_methods=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 2. With custom annotations

Add a [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotation to your .proto file

`your_service.proto`:

```diff
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;
+
+import &quot;google/api/annotations.proto&quot;;
+
 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
-  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
+  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
+    option (google.api.http) = {
+      post: &quot;/v1/example/echo&quot;
+      body: &quot;*&quot;
+    };
+  }
 }
```

&gt; You will need to provide the required third party protobuf files to the protobuf compiler.
&gt; If you are using [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf), this dependency can
&gt; be added to the `deps` array in your `buf.yaml` under the name
&gt; `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis`:
&gt;
&gt; ```yaml
&gt; version: v2
&gt; name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
&gt; deps:
&gt;   - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; Always run `buf dep update` after adding a dependency to your `buf.yaml`.

See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
and generated OpenAPI output.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you need to ensure the required
dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found
by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from the
[googleapis repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), and providing
them to `protoc` when running. The files you will need are:

```
google/api/annotations.proto
google/api/field_behavior.proto
google/api/http.proto
google/api/httpbody.proto
```

Here&#039;s what a `protoc` execution might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 3. External configuration

If you do not want to (or cannot) modify the proto file for use with gRPC-Gateway you can
alternatively use an external
[gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
[Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/)
for more information. This is best combined with the `standalone=true` option
to generate a file that can live in its own package, separate from the files
generated by the source protobuf file.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml \
    --grpc-gateway_opt standalone=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 5. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;flag&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog&quot;

  gw &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/proto/gen/go/your/service/v1/your_service&quot;  // Update
)

var (
  // command-line options:
  // gRPC server endpoint
  grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String(&quot;grpc-server-endpoint&quot;,  &quot;localhost:9090&quot;, &quot;gRPC server endpoint&quot;)
)

func run() error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()

  // Register gRPC server endpoint
  // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
  mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
  opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
  err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
  return http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8081&quot;, mux)
}

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  if err := run(); err != nil {
    grpclog.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

### 6. (Optional) Generate OpenAPI definitions using `protoc-gen-openapiv2`

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
  - local: protoc-gen-openapiv2
    out: gen/go
```

To use the custom protobuf annotations supported by `protoc-gen-openapiv2`, we need
another dependency added to our protobuf generation step. If you are using
`buf`, you can add the `buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway` dependency
to your `deps` array:

```yaml
version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
  - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
```

With `protoc` (just the swagger file):

```sh
protoc -I . --openapiv2_out ./gen/openapiv2 \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you will need to copy the protobuf
files from the `protoc-gen-openapiv2/options` directory of this repository,
and providing them to `protoc` when running.

Note that this plugin also supports generating OpenAPI definitions for unannotated methods;
use the `generate_unbound_methods` option to enable this.

It is possible with the HTTP mapping for a gRPC service method to create duplicate mappings
with the only difference being constraints on the path parameter.

`/v1/{name=projects/*}` and `/v1/{name=organizations/*}` both become `/v1/{name}`. When
this occurs the plugin will rename the path parameter with a &quot;\_1&quot; (or &quot;\_2&quot; etc) suffix
to differentiate the different operations. So in the above example, the 2nd path would become
`/v1/{name_1=organizations/*}`. This can also cause OpenAPI clients to URL encode the &quot;/&quot; that is
part of the path parameter as that is what OpenAPI defines in the specification. To allow gRPC gateway to
accept the URL encoded slash and still route the request, use the UnescapingModeAllCharacters or
UnescapingModeLegacy (which is the default currently though may change in future versions). See
[Customizing Your Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/)
for more information.

## Usage with remote plugins

As an alternative to all of the above, you can use `buf` with
[remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage)
to manage plugin versions and generation. An example `buf.gen.yaml` using remote
plugin generation looks like this:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.31.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.3.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/openapiv2:v2.16.2
    out: gen/openapiv2
```

This requires no local installation of any plugins. Be careful to use the same
version of the generator as the runtime library, i.e. if using `v2.16.2`, run

```shell
$ go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2@v2.16.2
```

To get the same version of the runtime in your `go.mod`.

Note that usage of remote plugins is incompatible with usage of external configuration files like [grpc_api_configuration](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/#using-an-external-configuration-file).

## Video intro

This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro to using the gRPC-Gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base: https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Parameters and flags

When using `buf` to generate stubs, flags and parameters are passed through
the `opt` field in your `buf.gen.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

During code generation with `protoc`, flags to gRPC-Gateway tools must be passed
through `protoc` using one of 2 patterns:

- as part of the `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out` `protoc` parameter: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out=&lt;flags&gt;:&lt;path&gt;`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
--openapiv2_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
```

- using additional `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt` parameters: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt=&lt;flag&gt;[,&lt;flag&gt;]*`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
--openapiv2_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
```

Use OSV-Scanner to find existing vulnerabilities affecting your project&#039;s dependencies.
OSV-Scanner provides an officially supported frontend to the [OSV database](https://osv.dev/) and CLI interface to [OSV-Scalibr](https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr) that connects a project’s list of dependencies with the vulnerabilities that affect them.

OSV-Scanner supports a wide range of project types, package managers and features, including but not limited to:

- **Languages:** C/C++, Dart, Elixir, Go, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Rust.
- **Package Managers:** npm, pip, yarn, maven, go modules, cargo, gem, composer, nuget and others.
- **Operating Systems:** Detects vulnerabilities in OS packages on Linux systems.
- **Containers:** Scans container images for vulnerabilities in their base images and included packages.
- **Guided Remediation:** Provides recommendations for package version upgrades based on criteria such as dependency depth, minimum severity, fix strategy, and return on investment.

OSV-Scanner uses the extensible [OSV-Scalibr](https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr) library under the hood to provide this functionality. If a language or package manager is not supported currently, please file a [feature request.](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/issues)

#### Underlying database

The underlying database, [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) has several benefits in comparison with closed source advisory databases and scanners:

- Covering most open source language and OS ecosystems (including [Git](https://osv.dev/list?q=&amp;ecosystem=GIT)), it’s comprehensive.
- Each advisory comes from an open and authoritative source (e.g. [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/github/advisory-database), [RustSec Advisory Database](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db), [Ubuntu security notices](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/tree/main/osv))
- Anyone can suggest improvements to advisories, resulting in a very high quality database.
- The OSV format unambiguously stores information about affected versions in a machine-readable format that precisely maps onto a developer’s list of packages

The above all results in accurate and actionable vulnerability notifications, which reduces the time needed to resolve them. Check out [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) for more details!

## Basic installation

To install OSV-Scanner, please refer to the [installation section](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/installation) of our documentation. OSV-Scanner releases can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/releases) of the GitHub repository. The recommended method is to download a prebuilt binary for your platform. Alternatively, you can use
`go install github.com/google/osv-scanner/v2/cmd/osv-scanner@latest` to build it from source.

## Key Features

For more information, please read our [detailed documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner) to learn how to use OSV-Scanner. For detailed information about each feature, click their titles in this README.

Please note: These are the instructions for the latest OSV-Scanner V2 beta. If you are using V1, checkout the V1 [README](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner-v1) and [documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner-v1/) instead.

### [Scanning a source directory](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage)

```bash
$ osv-scanner scan source -r /path/to/your/dir
```

This command will recursively scan the specified directory for any supported package files, such as `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, etc. and output any discovered vulnerabilities.

OSV-Scanner has the option of using call analysis to determine if a vulnerable function is actually being used in the project, resulting in fewer false positives, and actionable alerts.

OSV-Scanner can also detect vendored C/C++ code for vulnerability scanning. See [here](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/#cc-scanning) for details.

#### Supported Lockfiles

OSV-Scanner supports 11+ language ecosystems and 19+ lockfile types. To check if your ecosystem is covered, please check out our [detailed documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/supported-languages-and-lockfiles/#supported-lockfiles).

### [Container Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/scan-image)

OSV-Scanner also supports comprehensive, layer-aware scanning for container images to detect vulnerabilities the following operating system packages and language-specific dependencies.

| Distro Support | Language Artifacts Support |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Alpine OS      | Go                         |
| Debian         | Java                       |
| Ubuntu         | Node                       |
|                | Python                     |

See the [full documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/supported-languages-and-lockfiles/#supported-artifacts) for details on support.

**Usage**:

```bash
$ osv-scanner scan image my-image-name:tag
```

![screencast of html output of container scanning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bb95366-27ec-45d1-86ed-e42890f2fb46)

### [License Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/license-scanning/)

Check your dependencies&#039; licenses using deps.dev data. For a summary:

```bash
osv-scanner --licenses path/to/repository
```

To check against an allowed license list (SPDX format):

```bash
osv-scanner --licenses=&quot;MIT,Apache-2.0&quot; path/to/directory
```

### [Offline Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/offline-mode/)

Scan your project against a local OSV database. No network connection is required after the initial database download. The database can also be manually downloaded.

```bash
osv-scanner --offline --download-offline-databases ./path/to/your/dir
```

### [Guided Remediation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/) (Experimental)

OSV-Scanner provides guided remediation, a feature that suggests package version upgrades based on criteria such as dependency depth, minimum severity, fix strategy, and return on investment.
We currently support remediating vulnerabilities in the following files:

| Ecosystem | File Format (Type)             | Supported Remediation Strategies                                                                                  |
| :-------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm       | `package-lock.json` (lockfile) | [`in-place`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#in-place-lockfile-remediation) |
| npm       | `package.json` (manifest)      | [`relock`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#in-place-lockfile-remediation)   |
| Maven     | `pom.xml` (manifest)           | [`override`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#override-dependency-versions)  |

This is available as a headless CLI command, as well as an interactive mode.

#### Example (for npm)

```bash
$ osv-scanner fix \
    --max-depth=3 \
    --min-severity=5 \
    --ignore-dev  \
    --strategy=in-place \
    -L path/to/package-lock.json
```

#### Interactive mode (for npm)

```bash
$ osv-scanner fix \
    -M path/to/package.json \
    -L path/to/package-lock.json
```

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

# migrate

__Database migrations written in Go. Use as [CLI](#cli-usage) or import as [library](#use-in-your-go-project).__

* Migrate reads migrations from [sources](#migration-sources)
   and applies them in correct order to a [database](#databases).
* Drivers are &quot;dumb&quot;, migrate glues everything together and makes sure the logic is bulletproof.
   (Keeps the drivers lightweight, too.)
* Database drivers don&#039;t assume things or try to correct user input. When in doubt, fail.

Forked from [mattes/migrate](https://github.com/mattes/migrate)

## Databases

Database drivers run migrations. [Add a new database?](database/driver.go)

* [PostgreSQL](database/postgres)
* [PGX v4](database/pgx)
* [PGX v5](database/pgx/v5)
* [Redshift](database/redshift)
* [Ql](database/ql)
* [Cassandra / ScyllaDB](database/cassandra)
* [SQLite](database/sqlite)
* [SQLite3](database/sqlite3) ([todo #165](https://github.com/mattes/migrate/issues/165))
* [SQLCipher](database/sqlcipher)
* [MySQL / MariaDB](database/mysql)
* [Neo4j](database/neo4j)
* [MongoDB](database/mongodb)
* [CrateDB](database/crate) ([todo #170](https://github.com/mattes/migrate/issues/170))
* [Shell](database/shell) ([todo #171](https://github.com/mattes/migrate/issues/171))
* [Google Cloud Spanner](database/spanner)
* [CockroachDB](database/cockroachdb)
* [YugabyteDB](database/yugabytedb)
* [ClickHouse](database/clickhouse)
* [Firebird](database/firebird)
* [MS SQL Server](database/sqlserver)
* [rqlite](database/rqlite)

### Database URLs

Database connection strings are specified via URLs. The URL format is driver dependent but generally has the form: `dbdriver://username:password@host:port/dbname?param1=true&amp;param2=false`

Any [reserved URL characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters) need to be escaped. Note, the `%` character also [needs to be escaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_the_percent_character)

Explicitly, the following characters need to be escaped:
`!`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&amp;`, `&#039;`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `/`, `:`, `;`, `=`, `?`, `@`, `[`, `]`

It&#039;s easiest to always run the URL parts of your DB connection URL (e.g. username, password, etc) through an URL encoder. See the example Python snippets below:

```bash
$ python3 -c &#039;import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote(input(&quot;String to encode: &quot;), &quot;&quot;))&#039;
String to encode: FAKEpassword!#$%&amp;&#039;()*+,/:;=?@[]
FAKEpassword%21%23%24%25%26%27%28%29%2A%2B%2C%2F%3A%3B%3D%3F%40%5B%5D
$ python2 -c &#039;import urllib; print urllib.quote(raw_input(&quot;String to encode: &quot;), &quot;&quot;)&#039;
String to encode: FAKEpassword!#$%&amp;&#039;()*+,/:;=?@[]
FAKEpassword%21%23%24%25%26%27%28%29%2A%2B%2C%2F%3A%3B%3D%3F%40%5B%5D
$
```

## Migration Sources

Source drivers read migrations from local or remote sources. [Add a new source?](source/driver.go)

* [Filesystem](source/file) - read from filesystem
* [io/fs](source/iofs) - read from a Go [io/fs](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS)
* [Go-Bindata](source/go_bindata) - read from embedded binary data ([jteeuwen/go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata))
* [pkger](source/pkger) - read from embedded binary data ([markbates/pkger](https://github.com/markbates/pkger))
* [GitHub](source/github) - read from remote GitHub repositories
* [GitHub Enterprise](source/github_ee) - read from remote GitHub Enterprise repositories
* [Bitbucket](source/bitbucket) - read from remote Bitbucket repositories
* [Gitlab](source/gitlab) - read from remote Gitlab repositories
* [AWS S3](source/aws_s3) - read from Amazon Web Services S3
* [Google Cloud Storage](source/google_cloud_storage) - read from Google Cloud Platform Storage

## CLI usage

* Simple wrapper around this library.
* Handles ctrl+c (SIGINT) gracefully.
* No config search paths, no config files, no magic ENV var injections.

[CLI Documentation](cmd/migrate) (includes CLI install instructions)

### Basic usage

```bash
$ migrate -source file://path/to/migrations -database postgres://localhost:5432/database up 2
```

### Docker usage

```bash
$ docker run -v {{ migration dir }}:/migrations --network host migrate/migrate
    -path=/migrations/ -database postgres://localhost:5432/database up 2
```

## Use in your Go project

* API is stable and frozen for this release (v3 &amp; v4).
* Uses [Go modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) to manage dependencies.
* To help prevent database corruptions, it supports graceful stops via `GracefulStop chan bool`.
* Bring your own logger.
* Uses `io.Reader` streams internally for low memory overhead.
* Thread-safe and no goroutine leaks.

__[Go Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4)__

```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/postgres&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/github&quot;
)

func main() {
    m, err := migrate.New(
        &quot;github://mattes:personal-access-token@mattes/migrate_test&quot;,
        &quot;postgres://localhost:5432/database?sslmode=enable&quot;)
    m.Steps(2)
}
```

)

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open(&quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;postgres://localhost:5432/database?sslmode=enable&quot;)
    driver, err := postgres.WithInstance(db, &amp;postgres.Config{})
    m, err := migrate.NewWithDatabaseInstance(
        &quot;file:///migrations&quot;,
        &quot;postgres&quot;, driver)
    m.Up() // or m.Steps(2) if you want to explicitly set the number of migrations to run
}
```

# &lt;img src=&quot;https://opentelemetry.io/img/logos/opentelemetry-logo-nav.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenTelemetry Icon&quot; width=&quot;45&quot; height=&quot;&quot;&gt; OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to
receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need
to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support
open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to
multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

Objectives:

- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.
- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.
- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.
- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.
- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.

## Community

The OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)
channel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via
video calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:

- meet the humans behind the project
- get an opinion about specific proposals
- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack
- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously

We rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to
allow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:

Tuesday:

- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)

Wednesday:

- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)
- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)

Contributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.
Post a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong
reasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to
identify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.

Remember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the
relevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull
request where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous
calls and don&#039;t want them to feel excluded.

## Supported OTLP version

This code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,
considered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability
definition
here.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)

## Stability levels

See [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.

## Compatibility

When used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.

Support for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:

1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.
2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.

Official OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.

## Verifying the images signatures

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.

We are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:

```console
$ cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt; \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  &lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;
```

where:

- `&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt;`: is the release that you want to validate
- `&lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;`: is the image that you want to check

Example:

```console
$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0

Verification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates

[{&quot;critical&quot;:{&quot;identity&quot;:{&quot;docker-reference&quot;:&quot;ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;docker-manifest-digest&quot;:&quot;sha256:5cea85bcbc734a3c0a641368e5a4ea9d31b472997e9f2feca57eeb4a147fcf1a&quot;},&quot;type&quot;:&quot;cosign

[Gophish](https://getgophish.com) is an open-source phishing toolkit designed for businesses and penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily setup and execute phishing engagements and security awareness training.

### Install

Installation of Gophish is dead-simple - just download and extract the zip containing the [release for your system](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/), and run the binary. Gophish has binary releases for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

### Building From Source
**If you are building from source, please note that Gophish requires Go v1.10 or above!**

To build Gophish from source, simply run ```git clone https://github.com/gophish/gophish.git``` and ```cd``` into the project source directory. Then, run ```go build```. After this, you should have a binary called ```gophish``` in the current directory.

### Docker
You can also use Gophish via the official Docker container [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/gophish/gophish/).

### Setup
After running the Gophish binary, open an Internet browser to https://localhost:3333 and login with the default username and password listed in the log output.
