## Overview

Manage multiple installations of node.js on a Windows computer.

**tl;dr** Similar (not identical) to [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), but for Windows. Has an installer. [Download Now](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)!

This has always been a node version manager, not an io.js manager, so there is no back-support for io.js. Node 4+ is supported. Remember when running `nvm install` or `nvm use`, Windows usually requires administrative rights (to create symlinks). To install the latest version of Node.js, run `nvm install latest`. To install the latest stable version, run `nvm install lts`.

![NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/staticassets/raw/master/images/nvm-1.1.8-screenshot.jpg)

There are situations where the ability to switch between different versions of Node.js can be very useful. For example, if you want to test a module you&#039;re developing with the latest bleeding edge version without uninstalling the stable version of node, this utility can help.

### Installation &amp; Upgrades

#### :star: :star: Uninstall any pre-existing Node installations!! :star: :star:

The simplest (recommended) way to get NVM for Windows running properly is to uninstall any prior Node installation _before_ installing NVM for Windows. It avoids all of the pitfalls listed below. However; you may not wish to nuke your Node installation if you&#039;ve highly customized it. NVM for Windows _can_ assume management of an existing installation, but there are nuances to this (dependent entirely on the permissions of the user running the installation). If you have an administrative account, it&#039;s relatively safe to install NVM for Windows before uninstalling the original Node version. If you are working in a closed environment, such as a corporate Active Directory environment where installations/uninstallations are controlled by group policy, you should really consider removing the original version of Node before installing NVM4W.

_Permission Problems_
For security reasons, Windows will not allow an application from one vendor to &quot;uninstall&quot; an application from a different vendor. The official NVM4W installer will attempt assume management of an existing installation of Node., but it cannot actually uninstall the original Node.js version. To work around this, NVM for Windows installer attempts to copy the original Node.js installation files to the NVM root. This includes global npm modules and configurations. Once this process is complete, the original Node.js installation can be uninstalled without losing data.

_PATH Installation Problems_
If you attempt to configure the `NVM_SYMLINK` to use an existing directory (like `C:\Program Files\nodejs`), it will fail because a symlink cannot overwrite a physical directory. This is not a problem if you choose a different symlink path (such as `C:\nvm\node`).

_PATH Conflicts_
If you do not uninstall the original version, running `nvm use` may appear to do nothing at all. Running `node -v` will always show the original installation version. This is due to a [`PATH` conflict](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki/Common-Issues#why-do-i-need-to-uninstall-nodejs-before-installing-nvm-for-windows) that presents when the same application is installed multiple times. In NVM4W 1.1.11+, run `nvm debug` to determine if you have a `PATH` conflict.

For simpliciy, we recommend uninstalling any existing versions of Node.js before using NVM for Windows. Delete any existing Node.js installation directories (e.g., `%ProgramFiles%\nodejs`) that might remain. NVM&#039;s generated symlink will not overwrite an existing (even empty) installation directory.

:eyes: **Backup any global `npmrc` config** :eyes:
(e.g. `%AppData%\npm\etc\npmrc`)

Alternatively, copy the settings to the user config `%UserProfile%\.npmrc`. Delete the existing npm install location (e.g. `%AppData%\npm`) to prevent global module conflicts.

#### Install nvm-windows

Use the [latest installer](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm/releases) (comes with an uninstaller). Alternatively, follow the  [manual installation](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki#manual-installation) guide.

_If NVM4W doesn&#039;t appear to work immediately after installation, restart the terminal/powershell (not the whole computer)._

![NVM for Windows Installer](https://github.com/coreybutler/staticassets/raw/master/images/nvm-installer.jpg)

#### Reinstall any global utilities

After install, reinstalling global utilities (e.g. yarn) will have to be done for each installed version of node:

```
nvm use 14.0.0
npm install -g yarn
nvm use 12.0.1
npm install -g yarn
```

### Upgrading nvm-windows

:bulb: _As of v1.1.8, there is an upgrade utility that will automate the upgrade process._

**To upgrade nvm-windows**, run the new installer. It will safely overwrite the files it needs to update without touching your node.js installations. Make sure you use the same installation and symlink folder. If you originally installed to the default locations, you just need to click &quot;next&quot; on each window until it finishes.

### Usage

**nvm-windows runs in an Admin shell**. You&#039;ll need to start `powershell` or Command Prompt as Administrator to use nvm-windows

NVM for Windows is a command line tool. Simply type `nvm` in the console for help. The basic commands are:

- **`nvm arch [32|64]`**: Show if node is running in 32 or 64 bit mode. Specify 32 or 64 to override the default architecture.
- **`nvm debug`**: Check the NVM4W process for known problems.
- **`nvm current`**: Display active version.
- **`nvm install &lt;version&gt; [arch]`**:  The version can be a specific version, &quot;latest&quot; for the latest current version, or &quot;lts&quot; for the most recent LTS version. Optionally specify whether to install the 32 or 64 bit version (defaults to system arch). Set [arch] to &quot;all&quot; to install 32 AND 64 bit versions. Add `--insecure` to the end of this command to bypass SSL validation of the remote download server.
- **`nvm list [available]`**: List the node.js installations. Type `available` at the end to show a list of versions available for download.
- **`nvm on`**: Enable node.js version management.
- **`nvm off`**: Disable node.js version management (does not uninstall anything).
- **`nvm proxy [url]`**: Set a proxy to use for downloads. Leave `[url]` blank to see the current proxy. Set `[url]` to &quot;none&quot; to remove the proxy.
- **`nvm uninstall &lt;version&gt;`**: Uninstall a specific version.
- **`nvm use &lt;version&gt; [arch]`**: Switch to use the specified version. Optionally use `latest`, `lts`, or `newest`. `newest` is the latest _installed_ version. Optionally specify 32/64bit architecture. `nvm use &lt;arch&gt;` will continue using the selected version, but switch to 32/64 bit mode. For information about using `use` in a specific directory (or using `.nvmrc`), please refer to [issue #16](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/issues/16).
- **`nvm root &lt;path&gt;`**: Set the directory where nvm should store different versions of node.js. If `&lt;path&gt;` is not set, the current root will be displayed.
- **`nvm version`**: Displays the current running version of NVM for Windows.
- **`nvm node_mirror &lt;node_mirror_url&gt;`**: Set the node mirror.People in China can use *https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/node/*
- **`nvm npm_mirror &lt;npm_mirror_url&gt;`**: Set the npm mirror.People in China can use *https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/npm/*

### :warning: Gotcha!

Please note that any global npm modules you may have installed are **not** shared between the various versions of node.js you have installed. Additionally, some npm modules may not be supported in the version of node you&#039;re using, so be aware of your environment as you work.

### :name_badge: Antivirus

Users have reported some problems using antivirus, specifically McAfee. It appears the antivirus software is manipulating access to the VBScript engine. See [issue #133](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/issues/133) for details and resolution.

**v1.1.8 is not code signed**, but all other versions are signed by [Ecor Ventures LLC](https://ecorventures.com)/[Author.io](https://author.io). This should help prevent false positives with most antivirus software.

&gt; v1.1.8+ was not code signed due to an expired certificate (see the [release notes](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/tag/1.1.8) for reasons). **v1.1.9 _is_ code signed** thanks to [ajyong](https://github.com/ajyong), who sponsored the new certificate.

### Using Yarn

**tldr;** `npm i -g yarn`

See the [wiki](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki/Common-Issues#how-do-i-use-yarn-with-nvm-windows) for details.

### Build from source

- Install go from http://golang.org
- Download source / Git Clone the repo
- Change GOARCH to amd64 in build.bat if you feel like building a 64-bit executable
- Fire up a Windows command prompt and change directory to project dir
- Execute `go get github.com/blang/semver`
- Execute `go get github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter`
- Execute `build.bat`
- Check the `dist`directory for generated setup program.

## :bulb: Why another version manager?

There are several version managers for node.js. Tools like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and [n](https://github.com/tj/n)
only run on Mac OSX and Linux. Windows users are left in the cold? No. [nvmw](https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw) and [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist)
are both designed for Windows. So, why another version manager for Windows?

The architecture of most node version managers for Windows rely on `.bat` files, which do some clever tricks to set or mimic environment variables. Some of them use node itself (once it&#039;s downloaded), which is admirable, but prone to problems. Right around node 0.10.30, the installation structure changed a little, causing some of these to just stop working with anything new.

Additionally, some users struggle to install these modules since it requires a little more knowledge of node&#039;s installation structure. I believe if it were easier for people to switch between versions, people might take the time to test their code on back and future versions... which is just good practice.

## :bulb: What&#039;s the big difference?

First and foremost, this version of nvm has no dependency on node. It&#039;s written in [Go](https://golang.org/), which is a much more structured approach than hacking around a limited `.bat` file. It does not rely on having an existing node installation. Go offers the ability to create a Mac/Linux version on the same code base. In fact, this is already underway.

The control mechanism is also quite different. There are two general ways to support multiple node installations with hot switching capabilities. The first is to modify the system `PATH` any time you switch versions, or bypass it by using a `.bat` file to mimic the node executable and redirect accordingly. This always seemed a little hackish to me, and there are some quirks as a result of this implementation.

The second option is to use a symlink. This concept requires putting the symlink in the system `PATH`, then updating its target to the node installation directory you want to use. This is a straightforward approach, and seems to be what people recommend.... until they realize just how much of a pain symlinks are on Windows. This is why it hasn&#039;t happened before.

In order to create/modify a symlink, you must be running as an admin, and you must get around Windows UAC (that annoying prompt). Luckily, this is a challenge I already solved with some helper scripts in [node-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/node-windows). As a result, NVM for Windows maintains a single symlink that is put in the system `PATH` during installation only. Switching to different versions of node is a matter of switching the symlink target. As a result, this utility does **not** require you to run `nvm use x.x.x` every time you open a console window. When you _do_ run `nvm use x.x.x`, the active version of node is automatically updated across all open console windows. It also persists between system reboots, so you only need to use nvm when you want to make a change.

NVM for Windows comes with an installer, courtesy of a byproduct of my work on [Fenix Web Server](https://preview.fenixwebserver.com).

Overall, this project brings together some ideas, a few battle-hardened pieces of other modules, and support for newer versions of node.

NVM for Windows recognizes the &quot;latest&quot; versions using a [list](https://nodejs.org/download/release/index.json) provided by the Node project. Version 1.1.1+ use this list. Before this list existed, I was scraping releases and serving it as a standalone [data feed](https://github.com/coreybutler/nodedistro). This list was used in versions 1.1.0 and prior, but is now deprecated.

## Motivation

I needed it, plain and simple. Additionally, it&#039;s apparent that [support for multiple versions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/8075) is not coming to node core. It was also an excuse to play with Go.

## Why Go? Why not Node?

I chose Go because it is cross-platform, felt like less overhead than Java, has been around longer than most people think. Plus, I wanted to experiment with it. I&#039;ve been asked why I didn&#039;t write it with Node. Trying to write a tool with the tool you&#039;re trying to install doesn&#039;t make sense to me. As a result, my project requirements for this were simple... something that&#039;s not Node. Node will continue to evolve and change. If you need a reminder of that, remember io.js, Ayo, all the breaking changes between 4.x.x and 6.x.x, and the shift to ES Modules in 12+. Change is inevitable in the world of software. JavaScript is extremely dynamic.

## Intro

In the past I&#039;ve had some problems sharing my screen with coworkers using
corporate chatting solutions like Microsoft Teams. I wanted to show them some
of my code, but either the stream lagged several seconds behind or the quality
was so poor that my colleagues couldn&#039;t read the code. Or both.

That&#039;s why I created screego. It allows you to share your screen with good
quality and low latency. Screego is an addition to existing software and 
only helps to share your screen. Nothing else (:.

## Features

* Multi User Screenshare
* Secure transfer via WebRTC
* Low latency / High resolution
* Simple Install via Docker / single binary
* Integrated TURN Server see [NAT Traversal](https://screego.net/#/nat-traversal)

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

etcd is used [in production by many companies](./ADOPTERS.md), and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as [Kubernetes][k8s], [locksmith][], [vulcand][], [Doorman][], and many others. Reliability is further ensured by rigorous [**robustness testing**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness).

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.

## Maintainers

[Maintainers](OWNERS) strive to shape an inclusive open source project culture where users are heard and contributors feel respected and empowered. Maintainers aim to build productive relationships across different companies and disciplines. Read more about [Maintainers role and responsibilities](Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md#maintainers).

## Getting started

### Getting etcd

The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker on the [release page][github-release].

For more installation guides, please check out [play.etcd.io](http://play.etcd.io) and [operating etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide).

[github-release]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases

### Running etcd

First start a single-member cluster of etcd.

If etcd is installed using the [pre-built release binaries][github-release], run it from the installation location as below:

```bash
/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd
```

The etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:

```bash
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/
etcd
```

This will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.

Next, let&#039;s set a single key, and then retrieve it:

```bash
etcdctl put mykey &quot;this is awesome&quot;
etcdctl get mykey
```

etcd is now running and serving client requests. For more, please check out:

* [Interactive etcd playground](http://play.etcd.io)
* [Animated quick demo](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/demo)

### etcd TCP ports

The [official etcd ports][iana-ports] are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.

[iana-ports]: http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

### Running a local etcd cluster

First install [goreman](https://github.com/mattn/goreman), which manages Procfile-based applications.

Our [Procfile script](./Procfile) will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:

```bash
goreman start
```

This will bring up 3 etcd members `infra1`, `infra2` and `infra3` and optionally etcd `grpc-proxy`, which runs locally and composes a cluster.

Every cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.

Follow the comments in [Procfile script](./Procfile) to add a learner node to the cluster.

### Install etcd client v3

```bash
go get go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3
```

### Next steps

Now it&#039;s time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.

* Read the full [documentation].
* Review etcd [frequently asked questions].
* Explore the full gRPC [API].
* Set up a [multi-machine cluster][clustering].
* Learn the [config format, env variables and flags][configuration].
* Find [language bindings and tools][integrations].
* Use TLS to [secure an etcd cluster][security].
* [Tune etcd][tuning].

### Community meetings

etcd contributors and maintainers meet every week at `11:00` AM (USA Pacific) on Thursday and meetings alternate between community meetings and issue triage meetings. Meeting agendas are recorded in a [shared Google doc][shared-meeting-notes] and everyone is welcome to suggest additional topics or other agendas.

Issue triage meetings are aimed at getting through our backlog of PRs and Issues. Triage meetings are open to any contributor; you don&#039;t have to be a reviewer or approver to help out! They can also be a good way to get started contributing.

The meeting lead role is rotated for each meeting between etcd maintainers or sig-etcd leads and is recorded in a [shared Google sheet][shared-rotation-sheet].

Meeting recordings are uploaded to the official etcd [YouTube channel].

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

Nomad is a simple and flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage containers ([docker](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/drivers/docker), [podman](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/plugins/drivers/podman)), non-containerized applications ([executable](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/drivers/exec), [Java](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/drivers/java)), and virtual machines ([qemu](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/drivers/qemu)) across on-prem and clouds at scale.

Nomad is supported on Linux, Windows, and macOS. A commercial version of Nomad, [Nomad Enterprise](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/enterprise), is also available.

* Tutorials: [HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials)
* Forum: [Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/nomad)

Nomad provides several key features:

* **Deploy Containers and Legacy Applications**: Nomad’s flexibility as an orchestrator enables an organization to run containers, legacy, and batch applications together on the same infrastructure.  Nomad brings core orchestration benefits to legacy applications without needing to containerize via pluggable task drivers.

* **Simple &amp; Reliable**:  Nomad runs as a single binary and is entirely self contained - combining resource management and scheduling into a single system.  Nomad does not require any external services for storage or coordination.  Nomad automatically handles application, node, and driver failures.  Nomad is distributed and resilient, using leader election and state replication to provide high availability in the event of failures.

* **Device Plugins &amp; GPU Support**: Nomad offers built-in support for GPU workloads such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).  Nomad uses device plugins to automatically detect and utilize resources from hardware devices such as GPU, FPGAs, and TPUs.

* **Federation for Multi-Region, Multi-Cloud**: Nomad was designed to support infrastructure at a global scale.  Nomad supports federation out-of-the-box and can deploy applications across multiple regions and clouds.

* **Proven Scalability**: Nomad is optimistically concurrent, which increases throughput and reduces latency for workloads.  Nomad has been proven to scale to clusters of 10K+ nodes in real-world production environments.

* **HashiCorp Ecosystem**: Nomad integrates seamlessly with Terraform, Consul, Vault for provisioning, service discovery, and secrets management.

&gt; go-redis is the official Redis client library for the Go programming language. It offers a straightforward interface for interacting with Redis servers. 

## Supported versions

In `go-redis` we are aiming to support the last three releases of Redis. Currently, this means we do support:
- [Redis 7.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.2/00-RELEASENOTES) - using Redis Stack 7.2 for modules support
- [Redis 7.4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.4/00-RELEASENOTES) - using Redis Stack 7.4 for modules support
- [Redis 8.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.0/00-RELEASENOTES) - using Redis CE 8.0 where modules are included

Although the `go.mod` states it requires at minimum `go 1.18`, our CI is configured to run the tests against all three
versions of Redis and latest two versions of Go ([1.23](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.23.0),
[1.24](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.24.0)). We observe that some modules related test may not pass with
Redis Stack 7.2 and some commands are changed with Redis CE 8.0.
Please do refer to the documentation and the tests if you experience any issues. We do plan to update the go version
in the `go.mod` to `go 1.24` in one of the next releases.

## Installation

go-redis supports 2 last Go versions and requires a Go version with
[modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support. So make sure to initialize a Go
module:

```shell
go mod init github.com/my/repo
```

Then install go-redis/**v9**:

```shell
go get github.com/redis/go-redis/v9
```

## Quickstart

```go
import (
    &quot;context&quot;
    &quot;fmt&quot;

    &quot;github.com/redis/go-redis/v9&quot;
)

var ctx = context.Background()

func ExampleClient() {
    rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
        Addr:     &quot;localhost:6379&quot;,
        Password: &quot;&quot;, // no password set
        DB:       0,  // use default DB
    })

    err := rdb.Set(ctx, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, 0).Err()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    val, err := rdb.Get(ctx, &quot;key&quot;).Result()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(&quot;key&quot;, val)

    val2, err := rdb.Get(ctx, &quot;key2&quot;).Result()
    if err == redis.Nil {
        fmt.Println(&quot;key2 does not exist&quot;)
    } else if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(&quot;key2&quot;, val2)
    }
    // Output: key value
    // key2 does not exist
}
```

### Authentication

The Redis client supports multiple ways to provide authentication credentials, with a clear priority order. Here are the available options:

#### 1. Streaming Credentials Provider (Highest Priority) - Experimental feature

The streaming credentials provider allows for dynamic credential updates during the connection lifetime. This is particularly useful for managed identity services and token-based authentication.

```go
type StreamingCredentialsProvider interface {
    Subscribe(listener CredentialsListener) (Credentials, UnsubscribeFunc, error)
}

type CredentialsListener interface {
    OnNext(credentials Credentials)  // Called when credentials are updated
    OnError(err error)              // Called when an error occurs
}

type Credentials interface {
    BasicAuth() (username string, password string)
    RawCredentials() string
}
```

Example usage:
```go
rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
    Addr: &quot;localhost:6379&quot;,
    StreamingCredentialsProvider: &amp;MyCredentialsProvider{},
})
```

**Note:** The streaming credentials provider can be used with [go-redis-entraid](https://github.com/redis/go-redis-entraid) to enable Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) authentication. This allows for seamless integration with Azure&#039;s managed identity services and token-based authentication.

Example with Entra ID:
```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/redis/go-redis/v9&quot;
    &quot;github.com/redis/go-redis-entraid&quot;
)

// Create an Entra ID credentials provider
provider := entraid.NewDefaultAzureIdentityProvider()

// Configure Redis client with Entra ID authentication
rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
    Addr: &quot;your-redis-server.redis.cache.windows.net:6380&quot;,
    StreamingCredentialsProvider: provider,
    TLSConfig: &amp;tls.Config{
        MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,
    },
})
```

#### 2. Context-based Credentials Provider

The context-based provider allows credentials to be determined at the time of each operation, using the context.

```go
rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
    Addr: &quot;localhost:6379&quot;,
    CredentialsProviderContext: func(ctx context.Context) (string, string, error) {
        // Return username, password, and any error
        return &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;, nil
    },
})
```

#### 3. Regular Credentials Provider

A simple function-based provider that returns static credentials.

```go
rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
    Addr: &quot;localhost:6379&quot;,
    CredentialsProvider: func() (string, string) {
        // Return username and password
        return &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;
    },
})
```

#### 4. Username/Password Fields (Lowest Priority)

The most basic way to provide credentials is through the `Username` and `Password` fields in the options.

```go
rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
    Addr:     &quot;localhost:6379&quot;,
    Username: &quot;user&quot;,
    Password: &quot;pass&quot;,
})
```

#### Priority Order

The client will use credentials in the following priority order:
1. Streaming Credentials Provider (if set)
2. Context-based Credentials Provider (if set)
3. Regular Credentials Provider (if set)
4. Username/Password fields (if set)

If none of these are set, the client will attempt to connect without authentication.

### Protocol Version

The client supports both RESP2 and RESP3 protocols. You can specify the protocol version in the options:

```go
rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
    Addr:     &quot;localhost:6379&quot;,
    Password: &quot;&quot;, // no password set
    DB:       0,  // use default DB
    Protocol: 3,  // specify 2 for RESP 2 or 3 for RESP 3
})
```

### Connecting via a redis url

go-redis also supports connecting via the
[redis uri specification](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/tree/master/uri/redis.txt).
The example below demonstrates how the connection can easily be configured using a string, adhering
to this specification.

```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/redis/go-redis/v9&quot;
)

func ExampleClient() *redis.Client {
    url := &quot;redis://user:password@localhost:6379/0?protocol=3&quot;
    opts, err := redis.ParseURL(url)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    return redis.NewClient(opts)
}

```

### Instrument with OpenTelemetry

```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/redis/go-redis/v9&quot;
    &quot;github.com/redis/go-redis/extra/redisotel/v9&quot;
    &quot;errors&quot;
)

func main() {
    ...
    rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{...})

    if err := errors.Join(redisotel.InstrumentTracing(rdb), redisotel.InstrumentMetrics(rdb)); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
```


### Buffer Size Configuration

go-redis uses 0.5MiB read and write buffers by default for optimal performance. For high-throughput applications or large pipelines, you can customize buffer sizes:

```go
rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
    Addr:            &quot;localhost:6379&quot;,
    ReadBufferSize:  1024 * 1024, // 1MiB read buffer
    WriteBufferSize: 1024 * 1024, // 1MiB write buffer
})
```

### Advanced Configuration

go-redis supports extending the client identification phase to allow projects to send their own custom client identification.

#### Default Client Identification

By default, go-redis automatically sends the client library name and version during the connection process. This feature is available in redis-server as of version 7.2. As a result, the command is &quot;fire and forget&quot;, meaning it should fail silently, in the case that the redis server does not support this feature.

#### Disabling Identity Verification

When connection identity verification is not required or needs to be explicitly disabled, a `DisableIdentity` configuration option exists.
Initially there was a typo and the option was named `DisableIndentity` instead of `DisableIdentity`. The misspelled option is marked as Deprecated and will be removed in V10 of this library.
Although both options will work at the moment, the correct option is `DisableIdentity`. The deprecated option will be removed in V10 of this library, so please use the correct option name to avoid any issues.

To disable verification, set the `DisableIdentity` option to `true` in the Redis client options:

```go
rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
    Addr:            &quot;localhost:6379&quot;,
    Password:        &quot;&quot;,
    DB:              0,
    DisableIdentity: true, // Disable set-info on connect
})
```

#### Unstable RESP3 Structures for RediSearch Commands
When integrating Redis with application functionalities using RESP3, it&#039;s important to note that some response structures aren&#039;t final yet. This is especially true for more complex structures like search and query results. We recommend using RESP2 when using the search and query capabilities, but we plan to stabilize the RESP3-based API-s in the coming versions. You can find more guidance in the upcoming release notes.

To enable unstable RESP3, set the option in your client configuration:

```go
redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{
			UnstableResp3: true,
		})
```
**Note:** When UnstableResp3 mode is enabled, it&#039;s necessary to use RawResult() and RawVal() to retrieve a raw data.
          Since, raw response is the only option for unstable search commands Val() and Result() calls wouldn&#039;t have any affect on them:

```go
res1, err := client.FTSearchWithArgs(ctx, &quot;txt&quot;, &quot;foo bar&quot;, &amp;redis.FTSearchOptions{}).RawResult()
val1 := client.FTSearchWithArgs(ctx, &quot;txt&quot;, &quot;foo bar&quot;, &amp;redis.FTSearchOptions{}).RawVal()
```

#### Redis-Search Default Dialect

In the Redis-Search module, **the default dialect is 2**. If needed, you can explicitly specify a different dialect using the appropriate configuration in your queries.

**Important**: Be aware that the query dialect may impact the results returned. If needed, you can revert to a different dialect version by passing the desired dialect in the arguments of the command you want to execute.
For example:
```
	res2, err := rdb.FTSearchWithArgs(ctx,
		&quot;idx:bicycle&quot;,
		&quot;@pickup_zone:[CONTAINS $bike]&quot;,
		&amp;redis.FTSearchOptions{
			Params: map[string]interface{}{
				&quot;bike&quot;: &quot;POINT(-0.1278 51.5074)&quot;,
			},
			DialectVersion: 3,
		},
	).Result()
```
You can find further details in the [query dialect documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/dialects/).

## Look and feel

Some corner cases:

```go
// SET key value EX 10 NX
set, err := rdb.SetNX(ctx, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, 10*time.Second).Result()

// SET key value keepttl NX
set, err := rdb.SetNX(ctx, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, redis.KeepTTL).Result()

// SORT list LIMIT 0 2 ASC
vals, err := rdb.Sort(ctx, &quot;list&quot;, &amp;redis.Sort{Offset: 0, Count: 2, Order: &quot;ASC&quot;}).Result()

// ZRANGEBYSCORE zset -inf +inf WITHSCORES LIMIT 0 2
vals, err := rdb.ZRangeByScoreWithScores(ctx, &quot;zset&quot;, &amp;redis.ZRangeBy{
    Min: &quot;-inf&quot;,
    Max: &quot;+inf&quot;,
    Offset: 0,
    Count: 2,
}).Result()

// ZINTERSTORE out 2 zset1 zset2 WEIGHTS 2 3 AGGREGATE SUM
vals, err := rdb.ZInterStore(ctx, &quot;out&quot;, &amp;redis.ZStore{
    Keys: []string{&quot;zset1&quot;, &quot;zset2&quot;},
    Weights: []int64{2, 3}
}).Result()

// EVAL &quot;return {KEYS[1],ARGV[1]}&quot; 1 &quot;key&quot; &quot;hello&quot;
vals, err := rdb.Eval(ctx, &quot;return {KEYS[1],ARGV[1]}&quot;, []string{&quot;key&quot;}, &quot;hello&quot;).Result()

// custom command
res, err := rdb.Do(ctx, &quot;set&quot;, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;).Result()
```

## Run the test

go-redis will start a redis-server and run the test cases.

The paths of redis-server bin file and redis config file are defined in `main_test.go`:

```go
var (
	redisServerBin, _  = filepath.Abs(filepath.Join(&quot;testdata&quot;, &quot;redis&quot;, &quot;src&quot;, &quot;redis-server&quot;))
	redisServerConf, _ = filepath.Abs(filepath.Join(&quot;testdata&quot;, &quot;redis&quot;, &quot;redis.conf&quot;))
)
```

For local testing, you can change the variables to refer to your local files, or create a soft link
to the corresponding folder for redis-server and copy the config file to `testdata/redis/`:

```shell
ln -s /usr/bin/redis-server ./go-redis/testdata/redis/src
cp ./go-redis/testdata/redis.conf ./go-redis/testdata/redis/
```

Lastly, run:

```shell
go test
```

Another option is to run your specific tests with an already running redis. The example below, tests
against a redis running on port 9999.:

```shell
REDIS_PORT=9999 go test &lt;your options&gt;
```

## Elevator Pitch

Rant time: You&#039;ve heard it before, git is _powerful_, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? _Are you kidding me?_ To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can&#039;t be split down any further but contains code you don&#039;t want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file _by hand_? _Are you KIDDING me?!_ Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren&#039;t even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? _YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!_

If you&#039;re a mere mortal like me and you&#039;re tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it&#039;s a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.

## Features

### Stage individual lines

Press space on the selected line to stage it, or press `v` to start selecting a range of lines. You can also press `a` to select the entirety of the current hunk.

![stage_lines](../assets/demo/stage_lines-compressed.gif)

### Interactive Rebase

Press `i` to start an interactive rebase. Then squash (`s`), fixup (`f`), drop (`d`), edit (`e`), move up (`ctrl+k`) or move down (`ctrl+j`) any of TODO commits, before continuing the rebase by bringing up the rebase options menu with `m` and then selecting `continue`.

You can also perform any these actions as a once-off (e.g. pressing `s` on a commit to squash it) without explicitly starting a rebase.

This demo also uses shift+down to select a range of commits to move and fixup.

![interactive_rebase](../assets/demo/interactive_rebase-compressed.gif)

### Cherry-pick

Press `shift+c` on a commit to copy it and press `shift+v` to paste (cherry-pick) it.

![cherry_pick](../assets/demo/cherry_pick-compressed.gif)

### Bisect

Press `b` in the commits view to mark a commit as good/bad in order to begin a git bisect.

![bisect](../assets/demo/bisect-compressed.gif)

### Nuke the working tree

For when you really want to just get rid of anything that shows up when you run `git status` (and yes that includes dirty submodules) [kidpix style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4E2B_k2Bss), press `shift+d` to bring up the reset options menu and then select the &#039;nuke&#039; option.

![Nuke working tree](../assets/demo/nuke_working_tree-compressed.gif)

### Amend an old commit

Pressing `shift+a` on any commit will amend that commit with the currently staged changes (running an interactive rebase in the background).

![amend_old_commit](../assets/demo/amend_old_commit-compressed.gif)

### Filter

You can filter a view with `/`. Here we filter down our branches view and then hit `enter` to view its commits.

![filter](../assets/demo/filter-compressed.gif)

### Invoke a custom command

Lazygit has a very flexible [custom command system](docs/Custom_Command_Keybindings.md). In this example a custom command is defined which emulates the built-in branch checkout action.

![custom_command](../assets/demo/custom_command-compressed.gif)

### Worktrees

You can create worktrees to have multiple branches going at once without the need for

![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true &quot;Docker Compose Logo&quot;)

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.

&gt; **Note**: About Docker Swarm
&gt; Docker Swarm used to rely on the legacy compose file format but did not adopted the compose specification
&gt; so is missing some of the recent enhancements in the compose syntax. After 
&gt; [acquisition by Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/software/swarm/) swarm isn&#039;t maintained by Docker Inc, and
&gt; as such some Docker Compose features aren&#039;t accessible to swarm users.

# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app&#039;s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `compose.yaml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - &quot;5000:5000&quot;
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```

Contributing
------------

Want to help develop Docker Compose? Check out our
[contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you find an issue, please report it on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).

Legacy
-------------

The Python version of Compose is available under the `v1` [branch](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1).

# migrate

__Database migrations written in Go. Use as [CLI](#cli-usage) or import as [library](#use-in-your-go-project).__

* Migrate reads migrations from [sources](#migration-sources)
   and applies them in correct order to a [database](#databases).
* Drivers are &quot;dumb&quot;, migrate glues everything together and makes sure the logic is bulletproof.
   (Keeps the drivers lightweight, too.)
* Database drivers don&#039;t assume things or try to correct user input. When in doubt, fail.

Forked from [mattes/migrate](https://github.com/mattes/migrate)

## Databases

Database drivers run migrations. [Add a new database?](database/driver.go)

* [PostgreSQL](database/postgres)
* [PGX v4](database/pgx)
* [PGX v5](database/pgx/v5)
* [Redshift](database/redshift)
* [Ql](database/ql)
* [Cassandra / ScyllaDB](database/cassandra)
* [SQLite](database/sqlite)
* [SQLite3](database/sqlite3) ([todo #165](https://github.com/mattes/migrate/issues/165))
* [SQLCipher](database/sqlcipher)
* [MySQL / MariaDB](database/mysql)
* [Neo4j](database/neo4j)
* [MongoDB](database/mongodb)
* [CrateDB](database/crate) ([todo #170](https://github.com/mattes/migrate/issues/170))
* [Shell](database/shell) ([todo #171](https://github.com/mattes/migrate/issues/171))
* [Google Cloud Spanner](database/spanner)
* [CockroachDB](database/cockroachdb)
* [YugabyteDB](database/yugabytedb)
* [ClickHouse](database/clickhouse)
* [Firebird](database/firebird)
* [MS SQL Server](database/sqlserver)
* [rqlite](database/rqlite)

### Database URLs

Database connection strings are specified via URLs. The URL format is driver dependent but generally has the form: `dbdriver://username:password@host:port/dbname?param1=true&amp;param2=false`

Any [reserved URL characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters) need to be escaped. Note, the `%` character also [needs to be escaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_the_percent_character)

Explicitly, the following characters need to be escaped:
`!`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&amp;`, `&#039;`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `/`, `:`, `;`, `=`, `?`, `@`, `[`, `]`

It&#039;s easiest to always run the URL parts of your DB connection URL (e.g. username, password, etc) through an URL encoder. See the example Python snippets below:

```bash
$ python3 -c &#039;import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote(input(&quot;String to encode: &quot;), &quot;&quot;))&#039;
String to encode: FAKEpassword!#$%&amp;&#039;()*+,/:;=?@[]
FAKEpassword%21%23%24%25%26%27%28%29%2A%2B%2C%2F%3A%3B%3D%3F%40%5B%5D
$ python2 -c &#039;import urllib; print urllib.quote(raw_input(&quot;String to encode: &quot;), &quot;&quot;)&#039;
String to encode: FAKEpassword!#$%&amp;&#039;()*+,/:;=?@[]
FAKEpassword%21%23%24%25%26%27%28%29%2A%2B%2C%2F%3A%3B%3D%3F%40%5B%5D
$
```

## Migration Sources

Source drivers read migrations from local or remote sources. [Add a new source?](source/driver.go)

* [Filesystem](source/file) - read from filesystem
* [io/fs](source/iofs) - read from a Go [io/fs](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS)
* [Go-Bindata](source/go_bindata) - read from embedded binary data ([jteeuwen/go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata))
* [pkger](source/pkger) - read from embedded binary data ([markbates/pkger](https://github.com/markbates/pkger))
* [GitHub](source/github) - read from remote GitHub repositories
* [GitHub Enterprise](source/github_ee) - read from remote GitHub Enterprise repositories
* [Bitbucket](source/bitbucket) - read from remote Bitbucket repositories
* [Gitlab](source/gitlab) - read from remote Gitlab repositories
* [AWS S3](source/aws_s3) - read from Amazon Web Services S3
* [Google Cloud Storage](source/google_cloud_storage) - read from Google Cloud Platform Storage

## CLI usage

* Simple wrapper around this library.
* Handles ctrl+c (SIGINT) gracefully.
* No config search paths, no config files, no magic ENV var injections.

[CLI Documentation](cmd/migrate) (includes CLI install instructions)

### Basic usage

```bash
$ migrate -source file://path/to/migrations -database postgres://localhost:5432/database up 2
```

### Docker usage

```bash
$ docker run -v {{ migration dir }}:/migrations --network host migrate/migrate
    -path=/migrations/ -database postgres://localhost:5432/database up 2
```

## Use in your Go project

* API is stable and frozen for this release (v3 &amp; v4).
* Uses [Go modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) to manage dependencies.
* To help prevent database corruptions, it supports graceful stops via `GracefulStop chan bool`.
* Bring your own logger.
* Uses `io.Reader` streams internally for low memory overhead.
* Thread-safe and no goroutine leaks.

__[Go Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4)__

```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/postgres&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/github&quot;
)

func main() {
    m, err := migrate.New(
        &quot;github://mattes:personal-access-token@mattes/migrate_test&quot;,
        &quot;postgres://localhost:5432/database?sslmode=enable&quot;)
    m.Steps(2)
}
```

Want to use an existing database client?

```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/lib/pq&quot;
    &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4&quot;
    &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/postgres&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/file&quot;
)

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open(&quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;postgres://localhost:5432/database?sslmode=enable&quot;)
    driver, err := postgres.WithInstance(db, &amp;postgres.Config{})
    m, err := migrate.NewWithDatabaseInstance(
        &quot;file:///migrations&quot;,
        &quot;postgres&quot;, driver)
    m.Up() // or m.Steps(2) if you want to explicitly set the number of migrations to run
}
```

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.

OPA is proud to be a graduated project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) landscape. For details read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2021/02/04/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-open-policy-agent-graduation/).

  reference to integrate OPA with services written in other languages.
- See the [integration docs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/) for more options.

## Want to contribute to OPA?

- Read the [Contributing Guide](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/contributing/) to learn how to make your first contribution.
- Use [#contributors](https://openpolicyagent.slack.com/archives/C02L1TLPN59) in Slack to talk to other contributors and OPA maintainers.
- File a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues) to request features or report bugs.

## How does OPA work?

OPA gives you a high-level declarative language to author and enforce policies
across your stack.

With OPA, you define _rules_ that govern how your system should behave. These
rules exist to answer questions like:

- Can user X call operation Y on resource Z?
- What clusters should workload W be deployed to?
- What tags must be set on resource R before it&#039;s created?

You integrate services with OPA so that these kinds of policy decisions do not
have to be _hardcoded_ in your service. Services integrate with OPA by
executing _queries_ when policy decisions are needed.

When you query OPA for a policy decision, OPA evaluates the rules and data
(which you give it) to produce an answer. The policy decision is sent back as
the result of the query.

For example, in a simple API authorization use case:

- You write rules that allow (or deny) access to your service APIs.
- Your service queries OPA when it receives API requests.
- OPA returns allow (or deny) decisions to your service.
- Your service _enforces_ the decisions by accepting or rejecting requests accordingly.

For concrete examples of how to integrate OPA with systems like
[Kubernetes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes),
[Terraform](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/terraform),
[Docker](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/docker-authorization),
[SSH](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/ssh-and-sudo-authorization),

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TypeScript 7

[Not sure what this is? Read the announcement post!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)

## Preview

A preview build is available on npm as [`@typescript/native-preview`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/native-preview).

```sh
npm install @typescript/native-preview
npx tsgo # Use this as you would tsc.
```

A preview VS Code extension is [available on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.native-preview).

To use this, set this in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    &quot;typescript.experimental.useTsgo&quot;: true
}
```

## How to Build and Run

This repo uses [Go 1.24 or higher](https://go.dev/dl/), [Rust 1.85 or higher](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/), and [`hereby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hereby).

For tests and code generation, this repo contains a git submodule to the main TypeScript repo pointing to the commit being ported.
When cloning, you&#039;ll want to clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go.git
```

If you have already cloned the repo, you can initialize the submodule with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

With the submodule in place and `npm ci`, you can run tasks via `hereby`, similar to the TypeScript repo:

```sh
hereby build          # Verify that the project builds
hereby test           # Run all tests
hereby install-tools  # Install additional tools such as linters
hereby lint           # Run all linters
hereby format         # Format all code
hereby generate       # Generate all Go code (e.g. diagnostics, committed to repo)
```

Additional tasks are a work in progress.

`hereby` is not required to work on the repo; the regular `go` tooling (e.g., `go build`, `go test ./...`) will work as expected.
`hereby` tasks are provided as a convenience for those familiar with the TypeScript repo.

### Running `tsgo`

After running `hereby build`, you can run `built/local/tsgo`, which behaves mostly the same as `tsc`.

### Running LSP Prototype

To debug and run the VS Code extension without installing it globally:

* Run VS Code in the repo workspace (`code .`)
* Copy `.vscode/launch.template.json` to `.vscode/launch.json`
* &lt;kbd&gt;F5&lt;/kbd&gt; (or `Debug: Start Debugging` from the command palette)

This will launch a new VS Code instance which uses the Corsa LS as the backend. If correctly set up, you should see &quot;tsgo&quot; in the status bar when a TypeScript or JavaScript file is open:

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Entry point slightly different for now |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS5.8 |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently (in progress) |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JS Doc | not ready | - |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking |
| Build mode / project references | not ready | - |
| Incremental build | not ready | - |
| Language service (LSP) | prototype | Minimal functionality (errors, hover, go to def). More features coming soon |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.

![Badger mascot](images/diggy-shadow.png)

BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent and fast key-value (KV) database written in pure Go. It is the
underlying database for [Dgraph](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph), a fast, distributed graph database. It&#039;s meant
to be a performant alternative to non-Go-based key-value stores like RocksDB.

## Project Status

Badger is stable and is being used to serve data sets worth hundreds of terabytes. Badger supports
concurrent ACID transactions with serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) guarantees. A Jepsen-style
bank test runs nightly for 8h, with `--race` flag and ensures the maintenance of transactional
guarantees. Badger has also been tested to work with filesystem level anomalies, to ensure
persistence and consistency. Badger is being used by a number of projects which includes Dgraph,
Jaeger Tracing, UsenetExpress, and many more.

The list of projects using Badger can be found [here](#projects-using-badger).

Please consult the [Changelog] for more detailed information on releases.

## Design

Badger was written with these design goals in mind:

- Write a key-value database in pure Go.
- Use latest research to build the fastest KV database for data sets spanning terabytes.
- Optimize for SSDs.

Badger’s design is based on a paper titled _[WiscKey: Separating Keys from Values in SSD-conscious
Storage][wisckey]_.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The [WISCKEY paper][wisckey] (on which Badger is based) saw big wins with separating
values from keys, significantly reducing the write amplification compared to a typical LSM tree.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; RocksDB is an SSD optimized version of LevelDB, which was designed specifically for
rotating disks. As such RocksDB&#039;s design isn&#039;t aimed at SSDs.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; SSI: Serializable Snapshot Isolation. For more details, see the blog post
[Concurrent ACID Transactions in Badger](https://hypermode.com/blog/badger-txn/)

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Badger provides direct access to value versions via its Iterator API. Users can also
specify how many versions to keep per key via Options.

### Benchmarks

We have run comprehensive benchmarks against RocksDB, Bolt and LMDB. The benchmarking code, and the
detailed logs for the benchmarks can be found in the [badger-bench] repo. More explanation,
including graphs can be found the blog posts (linked above).

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MCP Toolbox for Databases is currently in beta, and may see breaking
&gt; changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

MCP Toolbox for Databases is an open source MCP server for databases. It enables
you to develop tools easier, faster, and more securely by handling the complexities
such as connection pooling, authentication, and more.

This README provides a brief overview. For comprehensive details, see the [full
documentation](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/).

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This solution was originally named “Gen AI Toolbox for Databases” as
&gt; its initial development predated MCP, but was renamed to align with recently
&gt; added MCP compatibility.

## Why Toolbox?

Toolbox helps you build Gen AI tools that let your agents access data in your
database. Toolbox provides:

- **Simplified development**: Integrate tools to your agent in less than 10
  lines of code, reuse tools between multiple agents or frameworks, and deploy
  new versions of tools more easily.
- **Better performance**: Best practices such as connection pooling,
  authentication, and more.
- **Enhanced security**: Integrated auth for more secure access to your data
- **End-to-end observability**: Out of the box metrics and tracing with built-in
  support for OpenTelemetry.

**⚡ Supercharge Your Workflow with an AI Database Assistant ⚡**

Stop context-switching and let your AI assistant become a true co-developer. By
[connecting your IDE to your databases with MCP Toolbox][connect-ide], you can
delegate complex and time-consuming database tasks, allowing you to build faster
and focus on what matters. This isn&#039;t just about code completion; it&#039;s about
giving your AI the context it needs to handle the entire development lifecycle.

Here’s how it will save you time:

- **Query in Plain English**: Interact with your data using natural language
  right from your IDE. Ask complex questions like, *&quot;How many orders were
  delivered in 2024, and what items were in them?&quot;* without writing any SQL.
- **Automate Database Management**: Simply describe your data needs, and let the
  AI assistant manage your database for you. It can handle generating queries,
  creating tables, adding indexes, and more.
- **Generate Context-Aware Code**: Empower your AI assistant to generate
  application code and tests with a deep understanding of your real-time
  database schema.  This accelerates the development cycle by ensuring the
  generated code is directly usable.
- **Slash Development Overhead**: Radically reduce the time spent on manual
  setup and boilerplate. MCP Toolbox helps streamline lengthy database
  configurations, repetitive code, and error-prone schema migrations.

## General Architecture

Toolbox sits between your application&#039;s orchestration framework and your
database, providing a control plane that is used to modify, distribute, or
invoke tools. It simplifies the management of your tools by providing you with a
centralized location to store and update tools, allowing you to share tools
between agents and applications and update those tools without necessarily
redeploying your application.

## Getting Started

### Installing the server

For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases] and use the
following instructions for your OS and CPU architecture.

[releases]: https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox/releases

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Binary&lt;/summary&gt;

To install Toolbox as a binary:

&lt;!-- {x-release-please-start-version} --&gt;
```sh
# see releases page for other versions
export VERSION=0.11.0
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/linux/amd64/toolbox
chmod +x toolbox
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Container image&lt;/summary&gt;
You can also install Toolbox as a container:

```sh
# see releases page for other versions
export VERSION=0.11.0
docker pull us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:$VERSION
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Homebrew&lt;/summary&gt;

To install Toolbox using Homebrew on macOS or Linux:

```sh
brew install mcp-toolbox
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Compile from source&lt;/summary&gt;

To install from source, ensure you have the latest version of
[Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), and then run the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox@v0.11.0
```
&lt;!-- {x-release-please-end} --&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

### Running the server

[Configure](#configuration) a `tools.yaml` to define your tools, and then
execute `toolbox` to start the server:

```sh
./toolbox --tools-file &quot;tools.yaml&quot;
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Toolbox enables dynamic reloading by default. To disable, use the
&gt; `--disable-reload` flag.

#### Homebrew Users

If you installed Toolbox using Homebrew, the `toolbox` binary is available in your system path. You can start the server with the same command:

```sh
toolbox --tools-file &quot;tools.yaml&quot;
```

You can use `toolbox help` for a full list of flags! To stop the server, send a
terminate signal (`ctrl+c` on most platforms).

          Name:        tool.Name(),
          Description: openai.String(tool.Description()),
          Parameters:  paramsSchema,
        },
      }

    }
    ```

  &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

## Configuration

The primary way to configure Toolbox is through the `tools.yaml` file. If you
have multiple files, you can tell toolbox which to load with the `--tools-file
tools.yaml` flag.

You can find more detailed reference documentation to all resource types in the
[Resources](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/resources/).

### Sources

The `sources` section of your `tools.yaml` defines what data sources your
Toolbox should have access to. Most tools will have at least one source to
execute against.

```yaml
sources:
  my-pg-source:
    kind: postgres
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
    database: toolbox_db
    user: toolbox_user
    password: my-password
```

For more details on configuring different types of sources, see the
[Sources](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/resources/sources).

### Tools

The `tools` section of a `tools.yaml` define the actions an agent can take: what
kind of tool it is, which source(s) it affects, what parameters it uses, etc.

```yaml
tools:
  search-hotels-by-name:
    kind: postgres-sql
    source: my-pg-source
    description: Search for hotels based on name.
    parameters:
      - name: name
        type: string
        description: The name of the hotel.
    statement: SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name ILIKE &#039;%&#039; || $1 || &#039;%&#039;;
```

For more details on configuring different types of tools, see the
[Tools](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/resources/tools).

### Toolsets

The `toolsets` section of your `tools.yaml` allows you to define groups of tools
that you want to be able to load together. This can be useful for defining
different groups based on agent or application.

```yaml
toolsets:
    my_first_toolset:
        - my_first_tool
        - my_second_tool
    my_second_toolset:
        - my_second_tool
        - my_third_tool
```

You can load toolsets by name:

```python
# This will load all tools
all_tools = client.load_toolset

Lightweight Kubernetes.  Production ready, easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary less than 100 MB.

Great for:

* Edge
* IoT
* CI
* Development
* ARM
* Embedding k8s
* Situations where a PhD in k8s clusterology is infeasible

What is this?
---

K3s is a [fully conformant](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pulls?q=is%3Apr+k3s) production-ready Kubernetes distribution with the following changes:

1. It is packaged as a single binary.
1. It adds support for sqlite3 as the default storage backend. Etcd3, MariaDB, MySQL, and Postgres are also supported.
1. It wraps Kubernetes and other components in a single, simple launcher.
1. It is secure by default with reasonable defaults for lightweight environments.
1. It has minimal to no OS dependencies (just a sane kernel and cgroup mounts needed).
1. It eliminates the need to expose a port on Kubernetes worker nodes for the kubelet API by exposing this API to the Kubernetes control plane nodes over a websocket tunnel.

K3s bundles the following technologies together into a single cohesive distribution:

* [Containerd](https://containerd.io/) &amp; [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)
* [Flannel](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel) for CNI
* [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/)
* [Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)
* [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) for ingress
* [Klipper-lb](https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb) as an embedded service load balancer provider
* [Kube-router](https://www.kube-router.io/) netpol controller for network policy
* [Helm-controller](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller) to allow for CRD-driven deployment of helm manifests
* [Kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine) as a datastore shim that allows etcd to be replaced with other databases
* [Local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) for provisioning volumes using local storage
* [Host utilities](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-root) such as iptables/nftables, ebtables, ethtool, &amp; socat

These technologies can be disabled or swapped out for technologies of your choice.

Additionally, K3s simplifies Kubernetes operations by maintaining functionality for:

* Managing the TLS certificates of Kubernetes components
* Managing the connection between worker and server nodes
* Auto-deploying Kubernetes resources from local manifests in realtime as they are changed.
* Managing an embedded etcd cluster

What&#039;s with the name?
--------------------

We wanted an installation of Kubernetes that was half the size in terms of memory footprint. Kubernetes is a
10 letter word stylized as k8s. So something half as big as Kubernetes would be a 5 letter word stylized as
K3s. A &#039;3&#039; is also an &#039;8&#039; cut in half vertically. There is neither a long-form of K3s nor official pronunciation.

Is this a fork?
---------------

No, it&#039;s a distribution. A fork implies continued divergence from the original. This is not K3s&#039;s goal or practice. K3s explicitly intends not to change any core Kubernetes functionality. We seek to remain as close to upstream Kubernetes as possible. However, we maintain a small set of patches (well under 1000 lines) important to K3s&#039;s use case and deployment model. We maintain patches for other components as well. When possible, we contribute these changes back to the upstream projects, for example, with [SELinux support in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/cri/pull/1487/commits/24209b91bf361e131478d15cfea1ab05694dc3eb). This is a common practice amongst software distributions.

K3s is a distribution because it packages additional components and services necessary for a fully functional cluster that go beyond vanilla Kubernetes. These are opinionated choices on technologies for components like ingress, storage class, network policy, service load balancer, and even container runtime. These choices and technologies are touched on in more detail in the [What is this?](#what-is-this) section.

How is this lightweight or smaller than upstream Kubernetes?
---

There are two major ways that K3s is lighter weight than upstream Kubernetes:
1. The memory footprint to run it is smaller
2. The binary, which contains all the non-containerized components needed to run a cluster, is smaller

The memory footprint is reduced primarily by running many components inside of a single process. This eliminates significant overhead that would otherwise be duplicated for each component.

The binary is smaller by removing third-party storage drivers and cloud providers, explained in more detail below.

What have you removed from upstream Kubernetes?
---

This is a common point of confusion because it has changed over time. Early versions of K3s had much more removed than the current version. K3s currently removes two things:

1. In-tree storage drivers
1. In-tree cloud provider

Both of these have out-of-tree alternatives in the form of [CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) and [CCM](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/), which work in K3s and which upstream is moving towards.

We remove these to achieve a smaller binary size. They can be removed while remaining conformant because neither affects core Kubernetes functionality. They are also dependent on third-party cloud or data center technologies/services, which may not be available in many K3s&#039; use cases.

What&#039;s next?
---

Check out our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see what we have planned moving forward.

Release cadence
---

K3s maintains pace with upstream Kubernetes releases. Our goal is to release patch releases within one week, and new minors within 30 days.

Our release versioning reflects the version of upstream Kubernetes that is being released. For example, the K3s release [v1.27.4+k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/tag/v1.27.4%2Bk3s1) maps to the `v1.27.4` Kubernetes release. We add a postfix in the form of `+k3s&lt;number&gt;` to allow us to make additional releases using the same version of upstream Kubernetes while remaining [semver](https://semver.org/) compliant. For example, if we discovered a high severity bug in `v1.27.4+k3s1` and needed to release an immediate fix for it, we would release `v1.27.4+k3s2`.

Documentation
-------------

Please see [the official docs site](https://docs.k3s.io) for complete documentation.

Quick-Start - Install Script
--------------

The `install.sh` script provides a convenient way to download K3s and add a service to systemd or openrc.

To install k3s as a service, run:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

A kubeconfig file is written to `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` and the service is automatically started or restarted.
The install script will install K3s and additional utilities, such as `kubectl`, `crictl`, `k3s-killall.sh`, and `k3s-uninstall.sh`, for example:

```bash
sudo kubectl get nodes
```

`K3S_TOKEN` is created at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` on your server.
To install on worker nodes, pass `K3S_URL` along with
`K3S_TOKEN` environment variables, for example:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=XXX sh -
```

Manual Download
---------------

1. Download `k3s` from latest [release](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/latest), x86_64, armhf, arm64 and s390x are supported.
1. Run the server.

```bash
sudo k3s server &amp;
# Kubeconfig is written to /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
sudo k3s kubectl get nodes

# On a different node run the below. NODE_TOKEN comes from
# /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token on your server
sudo k3s agent --server https://myserver:6443 --token ${NODE_TOKEN}
```
