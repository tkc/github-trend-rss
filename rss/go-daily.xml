evcc believes in open source software. We&#039;re committed to provide best in class EV charging experience.
Maintaining evcc consumes time and effort. With the vast amount of different devices to support, we depend on community and vendor support to keep evcc alive.

While evcc is open source, we would also like to encourage vendors to provide open source hardware devices, public documentation and support open source projects like ours that provide additional value to otherwise closed hardware. Where this is not the case, evcc requires &quot;sponsor token&quot; to finance ongoing development and support of evcc.

## About

PhoneInfoga is one of the most advanced tools to scan international phone numbers. It allows you to first gather basic information such as country, area, carrier and line type, then use various techniques to try to find the VoIP provider or identify the owner. It works with a collection of scanners that must be configured in order for the tool to be effective. PhoneInfoga doesn&#039;t automate everything, it&#039;s just there to help investigating on phone numbers.

## Current status

This project is stable and production-ready.

#### Demo instance termination

The demo instance has been terminated on December 21th, 2023. It&#039;s been expensive to maintain this instance throughout the years given the number of requests it received (~20K/month), without bringing much value to users compared to using it locally. Use it locally with your own API keys for a better experience.

## Features

- Check if phone number exists
- Gather basic information such as country, line type and carrier
- OSINT footprinting using external APIs, phone books &amp; search engines
- Check for reputation reports, social media, disposable numbers and more
- Use the graphical user interface to run scans from the browser
- Programmatic usage with the [REST API](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sundowndev/phoneinfoga/master/web/docs/swagger.yaml) and [Go modules](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sundowndev/phoneinfoga/v2)

## Anti-features

- Does not claim to provide relevant or verified data, it&#039;s just a tool !
- Does not allow to &quot;track&quot; a phone or its owner in real time
- Does not allow to get the precise phone location
- Does not allow to hack a phone

            <h2>README</h2><pre># GitHub CLI

`gh` is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code.

![screenshot of gh pr status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98482/84171218-327e7a80-aa40-11ea-8cd1-5177fc2d0e72.png)

GitHub CLI is supported for users on GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+ with support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Documentation

For [installation options see below](#installation), for usage instructions [see the manual][manual].

## Contributing

If anything feels off, or if you feel that some functionality is missing, please check out the [contributing page][contributing]. There you will find instructions for sharing your feedback, building the tool locally, and submitting pull requests to the project.

If you are a hubber and are interested in shipping new commands for the CLI, check out our [doc on internal contributions][intake-doc].

&lt;!-- this anchor is linked to from elsewhere, so avoid renaming it --&gt;
## Installation

### Linux &amp; BSD

`gh` is available via:
- [our Debian and RPM repositories](./docs/install_linux.md);
- community-maintained repositories in various Linux distros;
- OS-agnostic package managers such as [Homebrew](#homebrew), [Conda](#conda), [Spack](#spack), [Webi](#webi); and
- our [releases page][] as precompiled binaries.

For more information, see [Linux &amp; BSD installation](./docs/install_linux.md).

### Codespaces

To add GitHub CLI to your codespace, add the following to your [devcontainer file](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-features-to-a-devcontainer-file):

```json
&quot;features&quot;: {
  &quot;ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1&quot;: {}
}
```

### GitHub Actions

GitHub CLI comes pre-installed in all [GitHub-Hosted Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

### Other platforms

Download packaged binaries from the [releases page][].

#### Verification of binaries

Since version 2.50.0 `gh` has been producing [Build Provenance Attestation](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-06-25-artifact-attestations-is-generally-available/) enabling a cryptographically verifiable paper-trail back to the origin GitHub repository, git revision and build instructions used. The build provenance attestations are signed and relies on Public Good [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) for PKI.

There are two common ways to verify a downloaded release, depending if `gh` is already installed or not. If `gh` is installed, it&#039;s trivial to verify a new release:

- **Option 1: Using `gh` if already installed:**

  ```shell
  $ gh at verify -R cli/cli gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded digest sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc for file://gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
  ‚úì Verification succeeded!

  sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc was attested by:
  REPO     PREDICATE_TYPE                  WORKFLOW
  cli/cli  https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1  .github/workflows/deployment.yml@refs/heads/trunk
  ```

- **Option 2: Using Sigstore [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign):**

  To perform this, download the [attestation](https://github.com/cli/cli/attestations) for the downloaded release and use cosign to verify the authenticity of the downloaded release:

  ```shell
  $ cosign verify-blob-attestation --bundle cli-cli-attestation-3120304.sigstore.json \
        --new-bundle-format \
        --certificate-oidc-issuer=&quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot; \
        --certificate-identity-regexp=&quot;^https://github.com/cli/cli/.github/workflows/deployment.yml@refs/heads/trunk$&quot; \
        gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Verified OK
  ```

### Build from source

See here on how to [build GitHub CLI from source][build from source].

## Comparison with hub

For many years, [hub][] was the unofficial GitHub CLI tool. `gh` is a new project that helps us explore
what an official GitHub CLI tool can look like with a fundamentally different design. While both
tools bring GitHub to the terminal, `hub` behaves as a proxy to `git`, and `gh` is a standalone
tool. Check out our [more detailed explanation][gh-vs-hub] to learn more.

**_dae_**, means goose, is a high-performance transparent proxy solution.

To enhance traffic split performance as much as possible, dae employs the transparent proxy and traffic split suite within the Linux kernel using eBPF. As a result, dae can enable direct traffic to bypass the proxy application&#039;s forwarding, facilitating genuine direct traffic passage. Through this remarkable feat, there is minimal performance loss and negligible additional resource consumption for direct traffic.

As a successor of [v2rayA](https://github.com/v2rayA/v2rayA), dae abandoned v2ray-core to meet the needs of users more freely.

## Features

- [x] Implement `Real Direct` traffic split (need ipforward on) to achieve [high performance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UaWU6nNho7edBNjNqC8dfGXLlW0-cm84MM7sH6Gp7UE/edit?usp=sharing).
- [x] Support to split traffic by process name in local host.
- [x] Support to split traffic by MAC address in LAN.
- [x] Support to split traffic with invert match rules.
- [x] Support to automatically switch nodes according to policy. That is to say, support to automatically test independent TCP/UDP/IPv4/IPv6 latencies, and then use the best nodes for corresponding traffic according to user-defined policy.
- [x] Support advanced DNS resolution process.
- [x] Support full-cone NAT for shadowsocks, trojan(-go) and socks5 (no test).
- [x] Support various trending proxy protocols, seen in [proxy-protocols.md](./docs/en/proxy-protocols.md).

## Getting Started

Please refer to [Quick Start Guide](./docs/en/README.md) to start using `dae` right away!

## Notes

1. If you setup dae and also a shadowsocks server (or any UDP servers) on the same machine in public network, such as a VPS, don&#039;t forget to add `l4proto(udp) &amp;&amp; sport(your server ports) -&gt; must_direct` rule for your UDP server port. Because states of UDP are hard to maintain, all outgoing UDP packets will potentially be proxied (depends on your routing), including traffic to your client. This behaviour is not what we want to see. `must_direct` makes all traffic from this port including DNS traffic direct.
1. If users in mainland China find that the first screen time is very long when they visit some domestic websites for the first time, please check whether you use foreign DNS to handle some domestic domain in DNS routing. Sometimes this is hard to spot. For example, `ocsp.digicert.cn` is included in `geosite:geolocation-!cn` unexpectedly, which will cause some tls handshakes to take a long time. Be careful to use such domain sets in DNS routing.

## How it works

See [How it works](./docs/en/how-it-works.md).

## TODO

- [ ] Automatically check dns upstream and source loop (whether upstream is also a client of us) and remind the user to add sip rule.
- [ ] MACv2 extension extraction.
- [ ] Log to userspace.
- [ ] Protocol-oriented node features detecting (or filter), such as full-cone (especially VMess and VLESS).
- [ ] Add quick-start guide
- [ ] ...

### Build an application

Now that you have hopefully digested the _Go Fundamentals_ section you have a solid grounding of a majority of Go&#039;s language features and how to do TDD.

This next section will involve building an application.

Each chapter will iterate on the previous one, expanding the application&#039;s functionality as our product owner dictates.

New concepts will be introduced to help facilitate writing great code but most of the new material will be learning what can be accomplished from Go&#039;s standard library.

By the end of this, you should have a strong grasp as to how to iteratively write an application in Go, backed by tests.

* [HTTP server](http-server.md) - We will create an application which listens to HTTP requests and responds to them.
* [JSON, routing and embedding](json.md) - We will make our endpoints return JSON and explore how to do routing.
* [IO and sorting](io.md) - We will persist and read our data from disk and we&#039;ll cover sorting data.
* [Command line &amp; project structure](command-line.md) - Support multiple applications from one code base and read input from command line.
* [Time](time.md) - using the `time` package to schedule activities.
* [WebSockets](websockets.md) - learn how to write and test a server that uses WebSockets.

### Testing fundamentals

Covering other subjects around testing.

* [Introduction to acceptance tests](intro-to-acceptance-tests.md) - Learn how to write acceptance tests for your code, with a real-world example for gracefully shutting down a HTTP server
* [Scaling acceptance tests](scaling-acceptance-tests.md) - Learn techniques to manage the complexity of writing acceptance tests for non-trivial systems.
* [Working without mocks, stubs and spies](working-without-mocks.md) - Learn about how to use fakes and contracts to create more realistic and maintainable tests.
* [Refactoring Checklist](refactoring-checklist.md) - Some discussion on what refactoring is, and some basic tips on how to do it.

### Questions and answers

I often run in to questions on the internets like

&gt; How do I test my amazing function that does x, y and z

If you have such a question raise it as an issue on github and I&#039;ll try and find time to write a short chapter to tackle the issue. I feel like content like this is valuable as it is tackling people&#039;s _real_ questions around testing.

* [OS exec](os-exec.md) - An example of how we can reach out to the OS to execute commands to fetch data and keep our business logic testable/
* [Error types](error-types.md) - Example of creating your own error types to improve your tests and make your code easier to work with.
* [Context-aware Reader](context-aware-reader.md) - Learn how to TDD augmenting `io.Reader` with cancellation. Based on [Context-aware io.Reader for Go](https://pace.dev/blog/2020/02/03/context-aware-ioreader-for-golang-by-mat-ryer)
* [Revisiting HTTP Handlers](http-handlers-revisited.md) - Testing HTTP handlers seems to be the bane of many a developer&#039;s existence. This chapter explores the issues around designing handlers correctly.

### Meta / Discussion

* [Why unit tests and how to make them work for you](why.md) - Watch a video, or read about why unit testing and TDD is important
* [Anti-patterns](anti-patterns.md) - A short chapter on TDD and unit testing anti-patterns

## Background

I have some experience introducing Go to development teams and have tried different approaches as to how to grow a team from some people curious about Go into highly effective writers of Go systems.

### What didn&#039;t work

#### Read _the_ book

An approach we tried was to take [the blue book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440) and every week discuss the next chapter along with the exercises.

I love this book but it requires a high level of commitment. The book is very detailed in explaining concepts, which is obviously great but it means that the progress is slow and steady - this is not for everyone.

I found that whilst a small number of people would read chapter X and do the exercises, many people didn&#039;t.

#### Solve some problems

Katas are fun but they are usually limited in their scope for learning a language; you&#039;re unlikely to use goroutines to solve a kata.

Another problem is when you have varying levels of enthusiasm. Some people just learn way more of the language than others and when demonstrating what they have done end up confusing people with features the others are not familiar with.

This ends up making the learning feel quite _unstructured_ and _ad hoc_.

### What did work

By far the most effective way was by slowly introducing the fundamentals of the language by reading through [go by example](https://gobyexample.com/), exploring them with examples and discussing them as a group. This was a more interactive approach than &quot;read chapter x for homework&quot;.

Over time the team gained a solid foundation of the _grammar_ of the language so we could then start to build systems.

This to me seems analogous to practicing scales when trying to learn guitar.

It doesn&#039;t matter how artistic you think you are, you are unlikely to write good music without understanding the fundamentals and practicing the mechanics.

### What works for me

When _I_ learn a new programming language I usually start by messing around in a REPL but eventually, I need more structure.

What I like to do is explore concepts and then solidify the ideas with tests. Tests verify the code I write is correct and documents the feature I have learned.

Taking my experience of learning with a group and my own personal way I am going to try and create something that hopefully proves useful to other teams. Learning the fundamentals by writing small tests so that you can then take your existing software design skills and ship some great systems.

## Who this is for

* People who are interested in picking up Go.
* People who already know some Go, but want to explore testing with TDD.

## What you&#039;ll need

* A computer!
* [Installed Go](https://golang.org/)
* A text editor
* Some experience with programming. Understanding of concepts like `if`, variables, functions etc.
* Comfortable using the terminal

A simple, powerful library for building interactive forms and prompts in the terminal.

&lt;img alt=&quot;Running a burger form&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-3J4i6HE3yBmz6SUO3HqILr.gif&quot;&gt;

`huh?` is easy to use in a standalone fashion, can be
[integrated into a Bubble Tea application](#what-about-bubble-tea), and contains
a first-class [accessible mode](#accessibility) for screen readers.

The above example is running from a single Go program ([source](./examples/burger/main.go)).

## Tutorial

Let‚Äôs build a form for ordering burgers. To start, we‚Äôll import the library and
define a few variables where we&#039;ll store answers.

```go
package main

import &quot;github.com/charmbracelet/huh&quot;

var (
    burger       string
    toppings     []string
    sauceLevel   int
    name         string
    instructions string
    discount     bool
)
```

`huh?` separates forms into groups (you can think of groups as pages). Groups
are made of fields (e.g. `Select`, `Input`, `Text`). We will set up three
groups for the customer to fill out.

```go
form := huh.NewForm(
    huh.NewGroup(
        // Ask the user for a base burger and toppings.
        huh.NewSelect[string]().
            Title(&quot;Choose your burger&quot;).
            Options(
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Charmburger Classic&quot;, &quot;classic&quot;),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Chickwich&quot;, &quot;chickwich&quot;),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Fishburger&quot;, &quot;fishburger&quot;),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Charmpossible‚Ñ¢ Burger&quot;, &quot;charmpossible&quot;),
            ).
            Value(&amp;burger), // store the chosen option in the &quot;burger&quot; variable

        // Let the user select multiple toppings.
        huh.NewMultiSelect[string]().
            Title(&quot;Toppings&quot;).
            Options(
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Lettuce&quot;, &quot;lettuce&quot;).Selected(true),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Tomatoes&quot;, &quot;tomatoes&quot;).Selected(true),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Jalape√±os&quot;, &quot;jalape√±os&quot;),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Cheese&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot;),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Vegan Cheese&quot;, &quot;vegan cheese&quot;),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;Nutella&quot;, &quot;nutella&quot;),
            ).
            Limit(4). // there‚Äôs a 4 topping limit!
            Value(&amp;toppings),

        // Option values in selects and multi selects can be any type you
        // want. We‚Äôve been recording strings above, but here we‚Äôll store
        // answers as integers. Note the generic &quot;[int]&quot; directive below.
        huh.NewSelect[int]().
            Title(&quot;How much Charm Sauce do you want?&quot;).
            Options(
                huh.NewOption(&quot;None&quot;, 0),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;A little&quot;, 1),
                huh.NewOption(&quot;A lot&quot;, 2),
            ).
            Value(&amp;sauceLevel),
    ),

    // Gather some final details about the order.
    huh.NewGroup(
        huh.NewInput().
            Title(&quot;What‚Äôs your name?&quot;).
            Value(&amp;name).
            // Validating fields is easy. The form will mark erroneous fields
            // and display error messages accordingly.
            Validate(func(str string) error {
                if str == &quot;Frank&quot; {
                    return errors.New(&quot;Sorry, we don‚Äôt serve customers named Frank.&quot;)
                }
                return nil
            }),

        huh.NewText().
            Title(&quot;Special Instructions&quot;).
            CharLimit(400).
            Value(&amp;instructions),

        huh.NewConfirm().
            Title(&quot;Would you like 15% off?&quot;).
            Value(&amp;discount),
    ),
)
```

Finally, run the form:

```go
err := form.Run()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

if !discount {
    fmt.Println(&quot;What? You didn‚Äôt take the discount?!&quot;)
}
```

And that‚Äôs it! For more info see [the full source][burgersource] for this
example as well as [the docs][docs].

## Field Reference

- [`Input`](#input): single line text input
- [`Text`](#text): multi-line text input
- [`Select`](#select): select an option from a list
- [`MultiSelect`](#multiple-select): select multiple options from a list
- [`Confirm`](#confirm): confirm an action (yes or no)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Just want to prompt the user with a single field? Each field has a `Run`
&gt; method that can be used as a shorthand for gathering quick and easy input.

```go
var name string

huh.NewInput().
    Title(&quot;What‚Äôs your name?&quot;).
    Value(&amp;name).
    Run() // this is blocking...

fmt.Printf(&quot;Hey, %s!\n&quot;, name)
```

### Input

```go
huh.NewMultiSelect[string]().
    Options(
        huh.NewOption(&quot;Lettuce&quot;, &quot;Lettuce&quot;).Selected(true),
        huh.NewOption(&quot;Tomatoes&quot;, &quot;Tomatoes&quot;).Selected(true),
        huh.NewOption(&quot;Charm Sauce&quot;, &quot;Charm Sauce&quot;),
        huh.NewOption(&quot;Jalape√±os&quot;, &quot;Jalape√±os&quot;),

        huh.NewOption(&quot;Vegan Cheese&quot;, &quot;Vegan Cheese&quot;),
        huh.NewOption(&quot;Nutella&quot;, &quot;Nutella&quot;),
    ).
    Title(&quot;Toppings&quot;).
    Limit(4).
    Value(&amp;toppings)
```

### Confirm

Prompt the user to confirm (Yes or No).

&lt;img alt=&quot;Confirm field&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-2HeX5MdOxLsrWwsa0TNMIL.gif&quot;&gt;

```go
huh.NewConfirm().
    Title(&quot;Are you sure?&quot;).
    Affirmative(&quot;Yes!&quot;).
    Negative(&quot;No.&quot;).
    Value(&amp;confirm)
```

## Accessibility

`huh?` has a special rendering option designed specifically for screen readers.
You can enable it with `form.WithAccessible(true)`.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend setting this through an environment variable or configuration
&gt; option to allow the user to control accessibility.

```go
accessibleMode := os.Getenv(&quot;ACCESSIBLE&quot;) != &quot;&quot;
form.WithAccessible(accessibleMode)
```

Accessible forms will drop TUIs in favor of standard prompts, providing better
dictation and feedback of the information on screen for the visually impaired.

&lt;img alt=&quot;Accessible cuisine form&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-19xEBn4LgzPZDtgzXRRJYS.gif&quot;&gt;

## Themes

`huh?` contains a powerful theme abstraction. Supply your own custom theme or
choose from one of the five predefined themes:

- `Charm`
- `Dracula`
- `Catppuccin`
- `Base 16`
- `Default`

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Charm-themed form&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://stuff.charm.sh/huh/themes/charm-theme.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Dracula-themed form&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://stuff.charm.sh/huh/themes/dracula-theme.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Catppuccin-themed form&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://stuff.charm.sh/huh/themes/catppuccin-theme.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Base 16-themed form&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://stuff.charm.sh/huh/themes/basesixteen-theme.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Default-themed form&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://stuff.charm.sh/huh/themes/default-theme.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Themes can take advantage of the full range of
[Lip Gloss][lipgloss] style options. For a high level theme reference see
[the docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/huh#Theme).

## Dynamic Forms

`huh?` forms can be as dynamic as your heart desires. Simply replace properties
with their equivalent `Func` to recompute the properties value every time a
different part of your form changes.

Here‚Äôs how you would build a simple country + state / province picker.

First, define some variables that we‚Äôll use to store the user selection.

```go
var country string
var state string
```

Define your country select as you normally would:

```go
huh.NewSelect[string]().
    Options(huh.NewOptions(&quot;United States&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;)...).
    Value(&amp;country).
    Title(&quot;Country&quot;).
```

Define your state select with `TitleFunc` and `OptionsFunc` instead of `Title`
and `Options`. This will allow you to change the title and options based on the
selection of the previous field, i.e. `country`.

To do this, we provide a `func() string` and a `binding any` to `TitleFunc`. The
function defines what to show for the title and the binding specifies what value
needs to change for the function to recompute. So if `country` changes (e.g. the
user changes the selection) we will recompute the function.

For `OptionsFunc`, we provide a `func() []Option[string]` and a `binding any`.
We‚Äôll fetch the country‚Äôs states, provinces, or territories from an API. `huh`
will automatically handle caching for you.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; We have to pass `&amp;country` as the binding to recompute the function only when
&gt; `country` changes, otherwise we will hit the API too often.

```go
huh.NewSelect[string]().
    Value(&amp;state).
    Height(8).
    TitleFunc(func() string {
        switch country {
        case &quot;United States&quot;:
            return &quot;State&quot;
        case &quot;Canada&quot;:
            return &quot;Province&quot;
        default:
            return &quot;Territory&quot;
        }
    }, &amp;country).
    OptionsFunc(func() []huh.Option[string] {
        opts := fetchStatesForCountry(country)
        return huh.NewOptions(opts...)
    }, &amp;country),
```

Lastly, run the `form` with these inputs.

```go
err := form.Run()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-6FRmBjNi2aiRb4INPXwIjo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Country / State form with dynamic inputs running.&quot;&gt;

## Bonus: Spinner

`huh?` ships with a standalone spinner package. It‚Äôs useful for indicating
background activity after a form is submitted.

&lt;img alt=&quot;Spinner while making a burger&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-6HvYomAFP6H8mngOYWXvwJ.gif&quot;&gt;

Create a new spinner, set a title, set the action (or provide a `Context`), and run the spinner:

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Action Style&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Context Style&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```go
err := spinner.New().
    Title(&quot;Making your burger...&quot;).
    Action(makeBurger).
    Run()

fmt.Println(&quot;Order up!&quot;)
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```go
go makeBurger()

err := spinner.New().
    Type(spinner.Line).
    Title(&quot;Making your burger...&quot;).
    Context(ctx).
    Run()

fmt.Println(&quot;Order up!&quot;)
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

For more on Spinners see the [spinner examples](./spinner/examples) and
[the spinner docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/huh/spinner).

## What about Bubble Tea?

&lt;img alt=&quot;Bubbletea + Huh?&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; src=&quot;https://stuff.charm.sh/huh/bubbletea-huh.png&quot;&gt;

In addition to its standalone mode, `huh?` has first-class support for
[Bubble Tea][tea] and can be easily integrated into Bubble Tea applications.
It‚Äôs incredibly useful in portions of your Bubble Tea application that need
form-like input.

&lt;img alt=&quot;Bubble Tea embedded form example&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-3wGaB7EUKWmojeaHpARMUv.gif&quot;&gt;

A `huh.Form` is merely a `tea.Model`, so you can use it just as
you would any other [Bubble](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles).

```go
type Model struct {
    form *huh.Form // huh.Form is just a tea.Model
}

func NewModel() Model {
    return Model{
        form: huh.NewForm(
            huh.NewGroup(
                huh.NewSelect[string]().
                    Key(&quot;class&quot;).
                    Options(huh.NewOptions(&quot;Warrior&quot;, &quot;Mage&quot;, &quot;Rogue&quot;)...).
                    Title(&quot;Choose your class&quot;),

            huh.NewSelect[int]().
                Key(&quot;level&quot;).
                Options(huh.NewOptions(1, 20, 9999)...).
                Title(&quot;Choose your level&quot;),
            ),
        )
    }
}

func (m Model) Init() tea.Cmd {
    return m.form.Init()
}

func (m Model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    // ...

    form, cmd := m.form.Update(msg)
    if f, ok := form.(*huh.Form); ok {
        m.form = f
    }

    return m, cmd
}

func (m Model) View() string {
    if m.form.State == huh.StateCompleted {
        class := m.form.GetString(&quot;class&quot;)
        level := m.form.GetInt(&quot;level&quot;)
        return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;You selected: %s, Lvl. %d&quot;, class, level)
    }
    return m.form.View()
}

```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Trust Wallet Assets Info

![Check](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## Overview

Trust Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://trustwallet.com/assets/images/media/assets/horizontal_blue.png&#039; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

## How to add token

Please note that __brand new tokens are not accepted__,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and __non-minimal circulation__
(for limit details see &lt;https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/requirements&gt;).

### Assets App

The [Assets web app](https://assets.trustwallet.com) can be used for most new token additions (Github account is needed).

### Quick starter

Details of the repository structure and contribution guidelines are listed on the
[Developers site](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/new-asset).
Here is a quick starter summary for the most common use case.


## Documentation

For details, see the [Developers site](https://developer.trustwallet.com):

- [Contribution guidelines](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/repository_details)

- [FAQ](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/faq)

## Scripts

There are several scripts available for maintainers:

- `make check` -- Execute validation checks; also used in continuous integration.
- `make fix` -- Perform automatic fixes where possible
- `make update-auto` -- Run automatic updates from external sources, executed regularly (GitHub action)
- `make add-token asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Create `info.json` file as asset template.
- `make add-tokenlist asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Adds a token to tokenlist.json.
- `make add-tokenlist-extended asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Adds a token to tokenlist-extended.json.

## On Checks

This repo contains a set of scripts for verification of all the information. Implemented as Golang scripts, available through `make check`, and executed in CI build; checks the whole repo.
There are similar check logic implemented:

- in assets-management app; for checking changed token files in PRs, or when creating a PR.  Checks diffs, can be run from browser environment.
- in merge-fee-bot, which runs as a GitHub app shows result in PR comment. Executes in a non-browser environment.

## Trading pair maintenance

Info on supported trading pairs are stored in `tokenlist.json` files.
Trading pairs can be updated --
from Uniswap/Ethereum and PancakeSwap/Smartchain -- using update script (and checking in changes).
Minimal limit values for trading pair inclusion are set in the [config file](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/blob/master/.github/assets.config.yaml).
There are also options for force-include and force-exclude in the config.

## Disclaimer

Trust Wallet team allows anyone to submit new assets to this repository. However, this does not mean that we are in direct partnership with all of the projects.

Trust Wallet team will reject projects that are deemed as scam or fraudulent after careful review.
Trust Wallet team reserves the right to change the terms of asset submissions at any time due to changing market conditions, risk of fraud, or any other factors we deem relevant.

Additionally, spam-like behavior, including but not limited to mass distribution of tokens to random addresses will result in the asset being flagged as spam and possible removal from the repository.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Domain list community

This project manages a list of domains, to be used as geosites for routing purpose in Project V.

## Purpose of this project

This project is not opinionated. In other words, it does NOT endorse, claim or imply that a domain should be blocked or proxied. It can be used to generate routing rules on demand.

## Download links

- **dlc.dat**Ôºö[https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat)
- **dlc.dat.sha256sum**Ôºö[https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat.sha256sum](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat.sha256sum)

## Usage example

Each file in the `data` directory can be used as a rule in this format: `geosite:filename`.

```json
&quot;routing&quot;: {
  &quot;domainStrategy&quot;: &quot;IPIfNonMatch&quot;,
  &quot;rules&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Reject&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-ads-all&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-porn&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Direct&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;domain:icloud.com&quot;,
        &quot;domain:icloud-content.com&quot;,
        &quot;domain:cdn-apple.com&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:cn&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:private&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-1&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-anticensorship&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-media&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-vpnservices&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-2&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-dev&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-3&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:geolocation-!cn&quot;
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Generate `dlc.dat` manually

- Install `golang` and `git`
- Clone project code: `git clone https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community.git`
- Navigate to project root directory: `cd domain-list-community`
- Install project dependencies: `go mod download`
- Generate `dlc.dat` (without `datapath` option means to use domain lists in `data` directory of current working directory):
  - `go run ./`
  - `go run ./ --datapath=/path/to/your/custom/data/directory`

Run `go run ./ --help` for more usage information.

## Structure of data

All data are under `data` directory. Each file in the directory represents a sub-list of domains, named by the file name. File content is in the following format.

```
# comments
include:another-file
domain:google.com @attr1 @attr2
keyword:google
regexp:www\.google\.com$
full:www.google.com
```

**Syntax:**

&gt; The following types of rules are **NOT** fully compatible with the ones that defined by user in V2Ray config file. Do **Not** copy and paste directly.

* Comment begins with `#`. It may begin anywhere in the file. The content in the line after `#` is treated as comment and ignored in production.
* Inclusion begins with `include:`, followed by the file name of an existing file in the same directory.
* Subdomain begins with `domain:`, followed by a valid domain name. The prefix `domain:` may be omitted.
* Keyword begins with `keyword:`, followed by a string.
* Regular expression begins with `regexp:`, followed by a valid regular expression (per Golang&#039;s standard).
* Full domain begins with `full:`, followed by a complete and valid domain name.
* Domains (including `domain`, `keyword`, `regexp` and `full`) may have one or more attributes. Each attribute begins with `@` and followed by the name of the attribute.

&gt; **Note:** Adding new `regexp` and `keyword` rules is discouraged because it is easy to use them incorrectly, and proxy software cannot efficiently match these types of rules.

## How it works

The entire `data` directory will be built into an external `geosite` file for Project V. Each file in the directory represents a section in the generated file.

To generate a section:

1. Remove all the comments in the file.
2. Replace `include:` lines with the actual content of the file.
3. Omit all empty lines.
4. Generate each `domain:` line into a [sub-domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L21).
5. Generate each `keyword:` line into a [plain domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L17).
6. Generate each `regexp:` line into a [regex domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L19).
7. Generate each `full:` line into a [full domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L23).

## How to organize domains

### File name

Theoretically any string can be used as the name, as long as it is a valid file name. In practice, we prefer names for determinic group of domains, such as the owner (usually a company name) of the domains, e.g., &quot;google&quot;, &quot;netflix&quot;. Names with unclear scope are generally unrecommended, such as &quot;evil&quot;, or &quot;local&quot;.

### Attributes

Attribute is useful for sub-group of domains, especially for filtering purpose. For example, the list of `google` domains may contains its main domains, as well as domains that serve ads. The ads domains may be marked by attribute `@ads`, and can be used as `geosite:google@ads` in V2Ray routing.

# Introduction

restic is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure. It supports the three major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and a few smaller ones (FreeBSD, OpenBSD).

For detailed usage and installation instructions check out the [documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

You can ask questions in our [Discourse forum](https://forum.restic.net).

## Quick start

Once you&#039;ve [installed](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html) restic, start
off with creating a repository for your backups:

    $ restic init --repo /tmp/backup
    enter password for new backend:
    enter password again:
    created restic backend 085b3c76b9 at /tmp/backup
    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access the repository.
    Losing your password means that your data is irrecoverably lost.

and add some data:

    $ restic --repo /tmp/backup backup ~/work
    enter password for repository:
    scan [/home/user/work]
    scanned 764 directories, 1816 files in 0:00
    [0:29] 100.00%  54.732 MiB/s  1.582 GiB / 1.582 GiB  2580 / 2580 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
    duration: 0:29, 54.47MiB/s
    snapshot 40dc1520 saved

Next you can either use `restic restore` to restore files or use `restic
mount` to mount the repository via fuse and browse the files from previous
snapshots.

For more options check out the [online documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Backends

Saving a backup on the same machine is nice but not a real backup strategy.
Therefore, restic supports the following backends for storing backups natively:

- [Local directory](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#local)
- [sftp server (via SSH)](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#sftp)
- [HTTP REST server](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server) ([protocol](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#rest-backend), [rest-server](https://github.com/restic/rest-server))
- [Amazon S3](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#amazon-s3) (either from Amazon or using the [Minio](https://minio.io) server)
- [OpenStack Swift](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#openstack-swift)
- [BackBlaze B2](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#backblaze-b2)
- [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#microsoft-azure-blob-storage)
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#google-cloud-storage)
- And many other services via the [rclone](https://rclone.org) [Backend](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#other-services-via-rclone)

# Design Principles

Restic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the
following principles in mind:

-  **Easy**: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise
   you might be tempted to skip it. Restic should be easy to configure
   and use, so that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore
   it. Likewise, restoring data should not be complicated.

-  **Fast**: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by
   your network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files
   every day. Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring
   backups should only transfer data that is needed for the files that
   are to be restored, so that this process is also fast.

-  **Verifiable**: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic
   enables you to easily verify that all data can be restored.

-  **Secure**: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and
   integrity of your data. The location the backup data is stored is
   assumed not to be a trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where
   others like system administrators are able to access your backups).
   Restic is built to secure your data against such attackers.

-  **Efficient**: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should
   only take the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate
   data should be de-duplicated before it is actually written to the
   storage back end to save precious backup space.

# Reproducible Builds

The binaries released with each restic version starting at 0.6.1 are
[reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can
reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that
release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the
[builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).

Kopia is a fast and secure open-source backup/restore tool that allows you to create [encrypted](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#end-to-end-zero-knowledge-encryption) snapshots of your data and save the snapshots to [remote or cloud storage](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage) of your choice, [to network-attached storage or server](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage), or [locally on your machine](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage). Kopia does not &#039;image&#039; your whole machine. Rather, Kopia allows you to backup/restore any and all files/directories that you deem are important or critical.

Kopia has both [CLI (command-line interface)](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#both-command-line-and-graphical-user-interfaces) and [GUI (graphical user interface)](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#both-command-line-and-graphical-user-interfaces) versions, making it the perfect tool for both advanced and regular users. You can read more about Kopia&#039;s unique [features](https://kopia.io/docs/features/) -- which include [compression](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#compression), [deduplication](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#backup-files-and-directories-using-snapshots), [end-to-end &#039;zero knowledge&#039; encryption](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#end-to-end-zero-knowledge-encryption), and [error correction](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#error-correction) -- to get a better understanding of how Kopia works.

When ready, head to the [installation](https://kopia.io/docs/installation/) page to download and install Kopia, and make sure to read the [Getting Started Guide](https://kopia.io/docs/getting-started/) for a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use Kopia.

Pick the Cloud Storage Provider You Want
---

Kopia supports saving your [encrypted](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#end-to-end-zero-knowledge-encryption) and [compressed](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#compression) snapshots to all of the following [storage locations](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage):

* **Amazon S3** and any **cloud storage that is compatible with S3**
* **Azure Blob Storage**
* **Backblaze B2**
* **Google Cloud Storage**
* Any remote server or cloud storage that supports **WebDAV**
* Any remote server or cloud storage that supports **SFTP**
* Some of the cloud storage options supported by **Rclone**
  * Requires you to download and setup Rclone in addition to Kopia, but after that Kopia manages/runs Rclone for you
  * Rclone support is experimental: not all the cloud storage products supported by Rclone have been tested to work with Kopia, and some may not work with Kopia; Kopia has been tested to work with **Dropbox**, **OneDrive**, and **Google Drive** through Rclone
* Your local machine and any network-attached storage or server
* Your own server by setting up a [Kopia Repository Server](https://kopia.io/docs/repository-server/)

And Kopia uses [data deduplication](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#backup-files-and-directories-using-snapshots) to save you money! Read the [repositories help page](https://kopia.io/docs/repositories/) for more information on supported storage locations.

With Kopia you are in full control of where to store your snapshots, that is, you pick the storage provider you want to use. You must provision and pay for the storage provider for whatever storage locations you want to use, and then tell Kopia what those storage locations are. You can even use multiple storage locations for different backup repositories if you want. Kopia also supports backing up multiple machines to the same storage location.

**LocalAI** is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that‚Äôs compatible with OpenAI (Elevenlabs, Anthropic... ) API specifications for local AI inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families. Does not require GPU. It is created and maintained by [Ettore Di Giacinto](https://github.com/mudler).

Run the installer script:

```bash
curl https://localai.io/install.sh | sh
```

Or run with docker:
```bash
# CPU only image:
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 localai/localai:latest-cpu

# Nvidia GPU:
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 --gpus all localai/localai:latest-gpu-nvidia-cuda-12

# CPU and GPU image (bigger size):
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 localai/localai:latest

# AIO images (it will pre-download a set of models ready for use, see https://localai.io/basics/container/)
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 localai/localai:latest-aio-cpu
```

To load models:

```bash
# From the model gallery (see available models with `local-ai models list`, in the WebUI from the model tab, or visiting https://models.localai.io)
local-ai run llama-3.2-1b-instruct:q4_k_m
# Start LocalAI with the phi-2 model directly from huggingface
local-ai run huggingface://TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF/phi-2.Q8_0.gguf
# Install and run a model from the Ollama OCI registry
local-ai run ollama://gemma:2b
# Run a model from a configuration file
local-ai run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/.../phi-2.yaml
# Install and run a model from a standard OCI registry (e.g., Docker Hub)
local-ai run oci://localai/phi-2:latest
```

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.23 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  Command   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`geth`** | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options) for command line options. |
|   `clef`   | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  `devp2p`  | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  `abigen`  | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy-to-use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings) page for details.                                  |
|   `evm`    | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `rlpdump`  | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp)) dumps (data encoding used by the Ethereum protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user-friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`).                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we&#039;ve enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

Minimum:

* CPU with 4+ cores
* 8GB RAM
* 1TB free storage space to sync the Mainnet
* 8 MBit/sec download Internet service

Recommended:

* Fast CPU with 8+ cores
* 16GB+ RAM
* High-performance SSD with at least 1TB of free space
* 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum
network: create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this
particular use case, the user doesn&#039;t care about years-old historical data, so we can
sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:

```shell
$ geth console
```

This command will:
 * Start `geth` in snap sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
   of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start the built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/javascript-console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/blob/0.20.7/DOCUMENTATION.md) 
   (note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
   as well as `geth`&#039;s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach it to an already running
   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.

### A Full node on the Holesky test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you&#039;d like to play around with creating Ethereum
contracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until
you get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main
network, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to
the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```shell
$ geth --holesky console
```

The `console` subcommand has the same meaning as above and is equally
useful on the testnet too.

Specifying the `--holesky` flag, however, will reconfigure your `geth` instance a bit:

 * Instead of connecting to the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the Holesky 
   test network, which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis
   states.
 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), `geth`
   will nest itself one level deeper into a `holesky` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/holesky` on
   Linux). Note, on OSX and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node
   requires the use of a custom endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a
   production node endpoint by default, e.g.,
   `geth attach &lt;datadir&gt;/holesky/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by
   this.

*Note: Although some internal protective measures prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should always
use separate accounts for play and real money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

#### Docker quick start

One of the quickest ways to get Ethereum up and running on your machine is by using
Docker:

```shell
docker run -d --name ethereum-node -v /Users/alice/ethereum:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           ethereum/client-go
```

This will start `geth` in snap-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB, as the
above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for
saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag
available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers
and/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints are not
accessible from the outside.

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you&#039;ll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you&#039;d expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API&#039;s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API&#039;s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You&#039;ll need to use your own programming environments&#039; capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you&#039;ll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for
granted in the official networks need to be manually set up.

Unfortunately since [the Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/) it is no longer possible
to easily set up a network of geth nodes without also setting up a corresponding beacon chain.

There are three different solutions depending on your use case:

  * If you are looking for a simple way to test smart contracts from go in your CI, you can use the [Simulated Backend](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings#blockchain-simulator).
  * If you want a convenient single node environment for testing, you can use our [Dev Mode](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/dev-mode).
  * If you are looking for a multiple node test network, you can set one up quite easily with [Kurtosis](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/kurtosis).

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it&#039;ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don&#039;t need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It&#039;s based on software we use for our public [AdGuard DNS] servers, and both share a lot of code.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison&quot; id=&quot;comparison&quot; name=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparing AdGuard Home to other solutions&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adguard-dns&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot;&gt;How is this different from public AdGuard DNS servers?&lt;/a&gt;

Running your own AdGuard Home server allows you to do much more than using a public DNS server. It&#039;s a completely different level. See for yourself:

- Choose what exactly the server blocks and permits.

- Monitor your network activity.

- Add your own custom filtering rules.

- **Most importantly, it&#039;s your own server, and you are the only one who&#039;s in control.**

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-pi-hole&quot; id=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot; name=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;

At this point, AdGuard Home has a lot in common with Pi-Hole. Both block ads and trackers using the so-called ‚ÄúDNS sinkholing‚Äù method and both allow customizing what&#039;s blocked.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We&#039;re not going to stop here. DNS sinkholing is not a bad starting point, but this is just the beginning.

AdGuard Home provides a lot of features out-of-the-box with no need to install and configure additional software. We want it to be simple to the point when even casual users can set it up with minimal effort.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Some of the listed features can be added to Pi-Hole by installing additional software or by manually using SSH terminal and reconfiguring one of the utilities Pi-Hole consists of. However, in our opinion, this cannot be legitimately counted as a Pi-Hole&#039;s feature.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adblock&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to traditional ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;

It depends.

DNS sinkholing is capable of blocking a big percentage of ads, but it lacks the flexibility and the power of traditional ad blockers. You can get a good impression about the difference between these methods by reading [this article][blog-adaway], which compares AdGuard for Android (a traditional ad blocker) to hosts-level ad blockers (which are almost identical to DNS-based blockers in their capabilities). This level of protection is enough for some users.

Additionally, using a DNS-based blocker can help to block ads, tracking and analytics requests on other types of devices, such as SmartTVs, smart speakers or other kinds of IoT devices (on which you can&#039;t install traditional ad blockers).

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-limitations&quot; id=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot; name=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot;&gt;Known limitations&lt;/a&gt;

Here are some examples of what cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker:

- YouTube, Twitch ads;

- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram sponsored posts.

Essentially, any advertising that shares a domain with content cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker.

Is there a chance to handle this in the future?  DNS will never be enough to do this. Our only option is to use a content blocking proxy like what we do in the standalone AdGuard applications. We&#039;re [going to bring][issue-1228] this feature support to AdGuard Home in the future. Unfortunately, even in this case, there still will be cases when this won&#039;t be enough or would require quite a complicated configuration.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#how-to-build&quot; id=&quot;how-to-build&quot; name=&quot;how-to-build&quot;&gt;How to build from source&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#prerequisites&quot; id=&quot;prerequisites&quot; name=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make init` to prepare the development environment.

You will need this to build AdGuard Home:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.23 or later;
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v18.18 or later;
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v8 or later;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#building&quot; id=&quot;building&quot; name=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt;

Open your terminal and execute these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome
cd AdGuardHome
make
```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The non-standard `-j` flag is currently not supported, so building with `make -j 4` or setting your `MAKEFLAGS` to include, for example, `-j 4` is likely to break the build. If you do have your `MAKEFLAGS` set to that, and you don&#039;t want to change it, you can override it by running `make -j 1`.

Check the [`Makefile`][src-makefile] to learn about other commands.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#building-cross&quot; id=&quot;building-cross&quot; name=&quot;building-cross&quot;&gt;Building for a different platform&lt;/a&gt;

You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports. In order to do this, specify `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables as macros when running `make`.

For example:

```sh
env GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039; make
```

or:

```sh
make GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039;
```

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#preparing-releases&quot; id=&quot;preparing-releases&quot; name=&quot;preparing-releases&quot;&gt;Preparing releases&lt;/a&gt;

You&#039;ll need [`snapcraft`] to prepare a release build. Once installed, run the following command:

```sh
make build-release CHANNEL=&#039;...&#039; VERSION=&#039;...&#039;
```

See the [`build-release` target documentation][targ-release].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#docker-image&quot; id=&quot;docker-image&quot; name=&quot;docker-image&quot;&gt;Docker image&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make build-docker` to build the Docker image locally (the one that we publish to DockerHub). Please note, that we&#039;re using [Docker Buildx][buildx] to build our official image.

You may need to prepare before using these builds:

- (Linux-only) Install Qemu:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes --credential yes
  ```

- Prepare the builder:

  ```sh
  docker buildx create --name buildx-builder --driver docker-container --use
  ```

See the [`build-docker` target documentation][targ-docker].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#debugging-the-frontend&quot; id=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot; name=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot;&gt;Debugging the frontend&lt;/a&gt;

When you need to debug the frontend without recompiling the production version every time, for example to check how your labels would look on a form, you can run the frontend build a development environment.

1. In a separate terminal, run:

   ```sh
   ( cd ./client/ &amp;&amp; env NODE_ENV=&#039;development&#039; npm run watch )
   ```

2. Run your `AdGuardHome` binary with the `--local-frontend` flag, which instructs AdGuard Home to ignore the built-in frontend files and use those from the `./build/` directory.

3. Now any changes you make in the `./client/` directory should be recompiled and become available on the web UI. Make sure that you disable the browser cache to make sure that you actually get the recompiled version.

AdGuard Home uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for E2E testing. Tests are located in `tests/e2e`.

**Running Tests:**
- `npm run test:e2e` ‚Äì run all tests (headless).
- `npm run test:e2e:interactive` ‚Äì run tests interactively.
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` ‚Äì run tests in debug mode.
- `npm run test:e2e:codegen` ‚Äì generate new test code.

**Setup:**
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npx playwright install` to set up required browsers.

&gt; **Warning:** Playwright will download and install its own browser binaries for testing, which may differ from the browsers installed on your system.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#test-unstable-versions&quot; id=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot; name=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot;&gt;Test unstable versions&lt;/a&gt;

There are two update channels that you can use:

- `beta`: beta versions of AdGuard Home. More or less stable versions, usually released every two weeks or more often.

- `edge`: the newest version of AdGuard Home from the development branch. New updates are pushed to this channel daily.

There are three options how you can install an unstable version:

1. [Snap Store]: look for the `beta` and `edge` channels.

2. [Docker Hub]: look for the `beta` and `edge` tags.

3. Standalone builds. Use the automated installation script or look for the available builds [on the Wiki][wiki-platf].

   Script to install a beta version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c beta
   ```

   Script to install an edge version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c edge
   ```

**Overview**

Backrest is a web-accessible backup solution built on top of [restic](https://restic.net/). Backrest provides a WebUI which wraps the restic CLI and makes it easy to create repos, browse snapshots, and restore files. Additionally, Backrest can run in the background and take an opinionated approach to scheduling snapshots and orchestrating repo health operations.

By building on restic, Backrest leverages its mature, fast, reliable, and secure backup capabilities while adding an intuitive interface.

Built with Go, Backrest is distributed as a standalone, lightweight binary with restic as its sole dependency. It can securely create new repositories or manage existing ones. Once storage is configured, the WebUI handles most operations, while still allowing direct access to the powerful [restic CLI](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual_rest.html) for advanced operations when needed.

# User Guide

[See the Backrest docs](https://garethgeorge.github.io/backrest/introduction/getting-started).

# Installation

Backrest is packaged as a single executable. It can be run directly on Linux, macOS, and Windows. [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) will be downloaded and installed on first run.

### Quick Start Options

1. **Pre-built Release**: Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest/releases)
2. **Docker**: Use `garethgeorge/backrest:latest` ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/garethgeorge/backrest))
   - Includes rclone and common Unix utilities
   - For minimal image, use `garethgeorge/backrest:scratch`
3. **Build from Source**: See [Building](#building) section below

Once installed, access Backrest at `http://localhost:9898` (default port). First-time setup will prompt for username and password creation.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To change the default port, set the `BACKREST_PORT` environment variable (e.g., `BACKREST_PORT=0.0.0.0:9898` to listen on all interfaces)
&gt; 
&gt; Backrest will use your system&#039;s installed version of restic if it&#039;s available and compatible. If not, Backrest will download and install a suitable version in its data directory, keeping it updated. To use a specific restic binary, set the `BACKREST_RESTIC_COMMAND` environment variable to the desired path.


### Running with Docker Compose

Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/garethgeorge/backrest

Example compose file:

```yaml
version: &quot;3.8&quot;
services:
  backrest:
    image: garethgeorge/backrest:latest
    container_name: backrest
    hostname: backrest
    volumes:
      - ./backrest/data:/data
      - ./backrest/config:/config
      - ./backrest/cache:/cache
      - ./backrest/tmp:/tmp
      - /path/to/backup/data:/userdata  # Mount local paths to backup
      - /path/to/local/repos:/repos     # Mount local repos (optional for remote storage)
    environment:
      - BACKREST_DATA=/data
      - BACKREST_CONFIG=/config/config.json
      - XDG_CACHE_HOME=/cache
      - TMPDIR=/tmp
      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles
    ports:
      - &quot;9898:9898&quot;
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Running on Linux

### Running on Linux

1. **Download the Release**
   - Get the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest/releases)

2. **Installation Options**

   a) Using the Install Script (Recommended)
   ```sh
   mkdir backrest &amp;&amp; tar -xzvf backrest_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C backrest
   cd backrest &amp;&amp; sudo ./install.sh
   ```
   This script will:
   - Move the Backrest binary to `/usr/local/bin`
   - Create and start a systemd service

   b) Manual Installation with systemd
   ```sh
   sudo mv backrest /usr/local/bin/backrest
   sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/backrest.service &gt; /dev/null &lt;&lt;EOT
   [Unit]
   Description=Backrest
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=$(whoami)
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/backrest
   Environment=&quot;BACKREST_PORT=127.0.0.1:9898&quot;

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   EOT
   sudo systemctl enable --now backrest
   ```

   c) Using cron (Basic)
   ```sh
   sudo mv backrest /usr/local/bin/backrest
   (crontab -l 2&gt;/dev/null; echo &quot;@reboot /usr/local/bin/backrest&quot;) | crontab -
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Access Backrest at `http://localhost:9898`
   - For the systemd service: `sudo systemctl status backrest`

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Adjust the `User` in the systemd service file if needed. The install script and manual systemd instructions use your current user by default.
&gt;
&gt; By default backrest listens only on localhost, you can open optionally open it up to remote connections by setting the `BACKREST_PORT` environment variable. For systemd installations, run `sudo systemctl edit backrest` and add:
&gt; ```
&gt; [Service]
&gt; Environment=&quot;BACKREST_PORT=0.0.0.0:9898&quot;
&gt; ```
&gt; Using `0.0.0.0` allows connections from any interface.

### Arch Linux

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; [Backrest on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/backrest) is not maintained by the Backrest official and has made minor adjustments to the recommended services. Please refer to [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/backrest@.service?h=backrest) for details. In [backrest@.service](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/backrest@.service?h=backrest), use `restic` from the Arch Linux official repository by setting `BACKREST_RESTIC_COMMAND`. And for information on enable/starting/stopping services, please refer to [Systemd#Using_units](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd#Using_units).

```shell
## Install Backrest from AUR
paru -Sy backrest  # or: yay -Sy backrest

## Enable Backrest service for current user
sudo systemctl enable --now backrest@$USER.service
```

## Running on macOS

### Using Homebrew (Recommended)

Backrest is available via a [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/garethgeorge/homebrew-backrest-tap):

```sh
brew tap garethgeorge/homebrew-backrest-tap
brew install backrest
brew services start backrest
```

This method uses [Brew Services](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services) to manage Backrest. It will launch on startup and run on port 127.0.0.1:9898 by default.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You may need to grant Full Disk Access to Backrest. Go to `System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy &gt; Full Disk Access` and add `/usr/local/bin/backrest`.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest Darwin release from the [releases page](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest/releases).
2. Extract and install:

```sh
mkdir backrest &amp;&amp; tar -xzvf backrest_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz -C backrest
cd backrest &amp;&amp; ./install.sh
```

The install script will:
- Move the Backrest binary to `/usr/local/bin`
- Create a launch agent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.backrest.plist`
- Load the launch agent

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Review the script before running to ensure you&#039;re comfortable with its operations.

## Running on Windows

#### Windows Installer

Download the Windows installer for your architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest/releases). The installer, named Backrest-setup-[arch].exe, will place Backrest and a GUI tray application in `%localappdata%\Programs\Backrest\`. The tray application, set to start on login, monitors Backrest.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; To override the default port before installation, set a user environment variable named BACKREST_PORT. On Windows 10+, navigate to Settings &gt; About &gt; Advanced system settings &gt; Environment Variables. Under &quot;User variables&quot;, create a new variable with the value &quot;127.0.0.1:port&quot; (e.g., &quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot; for port 8080). If changing post-installation, re-run the installer to update shortcuts with the new port.
