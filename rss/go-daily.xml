## Quick Start

Ready to get your first agentic workflow running? Follow our step-by-step [Quick Start Guide](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) to install the extension, add a sample workflow, and see it in action.

## Overview

Learn about the concepts behind agentic workflows, explore available workflow types, and understand how AI can automate your repository tasks. See [How It Works](https://github.github.io/gh-aw/introduction/how-they-work/).

## Guardrails

Guardrails, safety and security are foundational to GitHub Agentic Workflows. Workflows run with read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized `safe-outputs`. The system implements multiple layers of protection including sandboxed execution, input sanitization, network isolation, supply chain security (SHA-pinned dependencies), tool allow-listing, and compile-time validation. Access can be gated to team members only, with human approval gates for critical operations, ensuring AI agents operate safely within controlled boundaries. See the [Security Architecture](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) for comprehensive details on threat modeling, implementation guidelines, and best practices.

Using agentic workflows in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

## Documentation

For complete documentation, examples, and guides, see the [Documentation](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/).

![Moby Project logo](docs/static_files/moby-project-logo.png &quot;The Moby Project&quot;)

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.

It provides a &quot;Lego set&quot; of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.

## Principles

Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set its direction.

- Modular: the project includes lots of components that have well-defined functions and APIs that work together.
- Batteries included but swappable: Moby includes enough components to build fully featured container systems, but its modular architecture ensures that most of the components can be swapped by different implementations.
- Usable security: Moby provides secure defaults without compromising usability.
- Developer focused: The APIs are intended to be functional and useful to build powerful tools.
They are not necessarily intended as end user tools but as components aimed at developers.
Documentation and UX is aimed at developers not end users.

## Audience

The Moby Project is intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent and build systems based on containers.
It is not for people looking for a commercially supported system, but for people who want to work and learn with open source code.

## Relationship with Docker

The components and tools in the Moby Project are initially the open source components that Docker and the community have built for the Docker Project.
New projects can be added if they fit with the community goals. Docker is committed to using Moby as the upstream for the Docker Product.
However, other projects are also encouraged to use Moby as an upstream, and to reuse the components in diverse ways, and all these uses will be treated in the same way. External maintainers and contributors are welcomed.

The Moby project is not intended as a location for support or feature requests for Docker products, but as a place for contributors to work on open source code, fix bugs, and make the code more useful.
The releases are supported by the maintainers, community and users, on a best efforts basis only. For customers who want enterprise or commercial support, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/) are the appropriate products for these use cases.

## Features

Support for Intel and Apple Silicon macOS, and Linux

- Simple CLI interface with sensible defaults
- Automatic Port Forwarding
- Volume mounts
- Multiple instances
- Support for multiple container runtimes
  - [Docker](https://docker.com) (with optional Kubernetes)
  - [Containerd](https://containerd.io) (with optional Kubernetes)
  - [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus) (containers and virtual machines)
- GPU accelerated containers for AI workloads

## Getting Started

### Installation

Colima is available on Homebrew, MacPorts, Nix and [mise](http://github.com/jdx/mise). Check [here](docs/INSTALL.md) for other installation options.

```
# Homebrew
brew install colima

# MacPorts
sudo port install colima

# Nix
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.colima

# Mise
mise use -g colima@latest

```

Or stay on the bleeding edge (only Homebrew)

```
brew install --HEAD colima
```

### Upgrading

If upgrading from v0.5.6 or lower, it is required to start afresh by deleting existing instance.

```sh
colima delete # delete existing instance
colima start
```

## Usage

Start Colima with defaults

```
colima start
```

For more usage options

```
colima --help
colima start --help
```

Or use a config file

```
colima start --edit
```

## Using Templates
When you run the `colima template` command, Colima opens the default configuration in a temporary file using your editor (VS Code by default, if installed).

For example, you might see something like:
```sh
/var/folders/hm/xmq4vxs13dl2hx2jyct65r080000gn/T/colima-2758922589.yaml

```
You can edit this temporary file as needed. Once you save and close the file in the editor, Colima automatically overwrites the default template config located at:
```sh
~/.colima/_templates/default.yaml

```
To see more options for working with templates, run:
```
colima template --help

```

## Runtimes

On initial startup, Colima initiates with a user specified runtime that defaults to Docker.

### Docker

Docker client is required for Docker runtime. Installable with brew `brew install docker`.

You can use the `docker` client on macOS after `colima start` with no additional setup.

### Containerd

`colima start --runtime containerd` starts and setup Containerd. You can use `colima nerdctl` to interact with
Containerd using [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl).

It is recommended to run `colima nerdctl install` to install `nerdctl` alias script in $PATH.

### Kubernetes

kubectl is required for Kubernetes. Installable with `brew install kubectl`.

To enable Kubernetes, start Colima with `--kubernetes` flag.

```
colima start --kubernetes
```

#### Interacting with Image Registry

For Docker runtime, images built or pulled with Docker are accessible to Kubernetes.

For Containerd runtime, images built or pulled in the `k8s.io` namespace are accessible to Kubernetes.

### Incus

&lt;small&gt;**Requires v0.7.0**&lt;/small&gt;


Incus client is required for Incus runtime. Installable with brew `brew install incus`.

`colima start --runtime incus` starts and setup Incus.

You can use the `incus` client on macOS after `colima start` with no additional setup.

**Note:** Running virtual machines on Incus is only supported on m3 or newer Apple Silicon devices.

### AI Models (GPU Accelerated)

&lt;small&gt;**Requires v0.10.0, Apple Silicon and macOS 13+**&lt;/small&gt;

Colima supports GPU accelerated containers for AI workloads using the `krunkit` VM type.

```
colima start --runtime docker --vm-type krunkit
colima model setup
colima model run gemma3
```

Multiple model registries are supported including HuggingFace (default) and Ollama.

```
colima model run hf://tinyllama
colima model run ollama://tinyllama
```

### Customizing the VM

The default VM created by Colima has 2 CPUs, 2GiB memory and 100GiB storage.

The VM can be customized either by passing additional flags to `colima start`.
e.g. `--cpu`, `--memory`, `--disk`, `--runtime`.
Or by editing the config file with `colima start --edit`.

**NOTE**: ~~disk size cannot be changed after the VM is created.~~ From v0.5.3, disk size can be increased.

#### Customization Examples

- create VM with 1CPU, 2GiB memory and 10GiB storage.

  ```
  colima start --cpu 1 --memory 2 --disk 10
  ```

- modify an existing VM to 4CPUs and 8GiB memory.

  ```
  colima stop
  colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8
  ```

- create VM with Rosetta 2 emulation. Requires v0.5.3 and macOS &gt;= 13 (Ventura) on Apple Silicon.

  ```
  colima start --vm-type=vz --vz-rosetta
  ```

## Project Goal

To provide container runtimes on macOS with minimal setup.

## What is with the name?

Colima means Containers on [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima).

Since Lima is aka Linux Machines. By transitivity, Colima can also mean Containers on Linux Machines.

## And the Logo?

The logo was contributed by [Daniel Hodvogner](https://github.com/dhodvogner). Check [this issue](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/issues/781) for more.

**ntfy** (pronounced &quot;*notify*&quot;) is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) 
notification service. With ntfy, you can **send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts** from any computer, 
**without having to sign up or pay any fees**. If you&#039;d like to run your own instance of the service, you can easily do 
so since ntfy is open source.

You can access the free version of ntfy at **[ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh)**. There is also an [open-source Android app](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android)
available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/),
as well as an [open source iOS app](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-ios) available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347).

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-git/go-git/v6?status.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v6) [![Build Status](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/actions) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/go-git/go-git)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/go-git/go-git) [![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/go-git/go-git/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/go-git/go-git)

*go-git* is a highly extensible git implementation library written in **pure Go**.

It can be used to manipulate git repositories at low level *(plumbing)* or high level *(porcelain)*, through an idiomatic Go API. It also supports several types of storage, such as in-memory filesystems, or custom implementations, thanks to the [`Storer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v6/plumbing/storer) interface.

It&#039;s being actively developed since 2015 and is being used extensively by [Keybase](https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone), [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) or [Pulumi](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apulumi+go-git&amp;type=Code), and by many other libraries and tools.

Project Status
--------------

After the [legal issues](https://github.com/src-d/go-git/issues/1295#issuecomment-592965250) with the [`src-d`](https://github.com/src-d) organization, the lack of update for four months and the requirement to make a hard fork, the project is **now back to normality**.

The project is currently actively maintained by individual contributors, including several of the original authors, but also backed by a new company, [gitsight](https://github.com/gitsight), where `go-git` is a critical component used at scale.


Comparison with git
-------------------

*go-git* aims to be fully compatible with [git](https://github.com/git/git), all the *porcelain* operations are implemented to work exactly as *git* does.

*git* is a humongous project with years of development by thousands of contributors, making it challenging for *go-git* to implement all the features. You can find a comparison of *go-git* vs *git* in the [compatibility documentation](COMPATIBILITY.md).


Installation
------------

The recommended way to install *go-git* is:

```go
import &quot;github.com/go-git/go-git/v6&quot; // with go modules enabled (GO111MODULE=on or outside GOPATH)
import &quot;github.com/go-git/go-git&quot; // with go modules disabled
```


Examples
--------

&gt; Please note that the `CheckIfError` and `Info` functions  used in the examples are from the [examples package](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/blob/master/_examples/common.go#L19) just to be used in the examples.


### Basic example

A basic example that mimics the standard `git clone` command

```go
// Clone the given repository to the given directory
Info(&quot;git clone https://github.com/go-git/go-git&quot;)

_, err := git.PlainClone(&quot;/tmp/foo&quot;, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
    URL:      &quot;https://github.com/go-git/go-git&quot;,
    Progress: os.Stdout,
})

CheckIfError(err)
```

Outputs:
```
Counting objects: 4924, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (1333/1333), done.
Total 4924 (delta 530), reused 6 (delta 6), pack-reused 3533
```

### In-memory example

Cloning a repository into memory and printing the history of HEAD, just like `git log` does


```go
// Clones the given repository in memory, creating the remote, the local
// branches and fetching the objects, exactly as:
Info(&quot;git clone https://github.com/go-git/go-billy&quot;)

r, err := git.Clone(memory.NewStorage(), nil, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
    URL: &quot;https://github.com/go-git/go-billy&quot;,
})

CheckIfError(err)

// Gets the HEAD history from HEAD, just like this command:
Info(&quot;git log&quot;)

// ... retrieves the branch pointed by HEAD
ref, err := r.Head()
CheckIfError(err)


// ... retrieves the commit history
cIter, err := r.Log(&amp;git.LogOptions{From: ref.Hash()})
CheckIfError(err)

// ... just iterates over the commits, printing it
err = cIter.ForEach(func(c *object.Commit) error {
	fmt.Println(c)
	return nil
})
CheckIfError(err)
```

Outputs:
```

# MCP Go SDK

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

This repository contains an implementation of the official Go software
development kit (SDK) for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Package / Feature documentation

The SDK consists of several importable packages:

- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp)
  package defines the primary APIs for constructing and using MCP clients and
  servers.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc) package is for users implementing
  their own transports.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth)
  package provides some primitives for supporting OAuth.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex)
  package provides extensions to the OAuth protocol, such as ProtectedResourceMetadata.

The SDK endeavors to implement the full MCP spec. The [`docs/`](/docs/) directory
contains feature documentation, mapping the MCP spec to the packages above.

## Version Compatibility

The following table shows which versions of the Go SDK support which versions of the MCP specification:

| SDK Version     | Latest MCP Spec   | All Supported MCP Specs                        |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| v1.2.0+         | 2025-06-18        | 2025-11-25, 2025-06-18, 2025-03-26, 2024-11-05 |
| v1.0.0 - v1.1.0 | 2025-06-18        | 2025-06-18, 2025-03-26, 2024-11-05             |

New releases of the SDK target only supported versions of Go. See
https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy for more information.

## Getting started

To get started creating an MCP server, create an `mcp.Server` instance, add
features to it, and then run it over an `mcp.Transport`. For example, this
server adds a single simple tool, and then connects it to clients over
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

type Input struct {
	Name string `json:&quot;name&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the name of the person to greet&quot;`
}

type Output struct {
	Greeting string `json:&quot;greeting&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the greeting to tell to the user&quot;`
}

func SayHi(ctx context.Context, req *mcp.CallToolRequest, input Input) (
	*mcp.CallToolResult,
	Output,
	error,
) {
	return nil, Output{Greeting: &quot;Hi &quot; + input.Name}, nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a server with a single tool.
	server := mcp.NewServer(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;greeter&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)
	mcp.AddTool(server, &amp;mcp.Tool{Name: &quot;greet&quot;, Description: &quot;say hi&quot;}, SayHi)
	// Run the server over stdin/stdout, until the client disconnects.
	if err := server.Run(context.Background(), &amp;mcp.StdioTransport{}); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

To communicate with that server, create an `mcp.Client` and connect it to the
corresponding server, by running the server command and communicating over its
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;os/exec&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Create a new client, with no features.
	client := mcp.NewClient(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;mcp-client&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)

	// Connect to a server over stdin/stdout.
	transport := &amp;mcp.CommandTransport{Command: exec.Command(&quot;myserver&quot;)}
	session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	// Call a tool on the server.
	params := &amp;mcp.CallToolParams{
		Name:      &quot;greet&quot;,
		Arguments: map[string]any{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;you&quot;},
	}
	res, err := session.CallTool(ctx, params)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;CallTool failed: %v&quot;, err)
	}
	if res.IsError {
		log.Fatal(&quot;tool failed&quot;)
	}
	for _, c := range res.Content {
		log.Print(c.(*mcp.TextContent).Text)
	}
}
```

The [`examples/`](/examples/) directory contains more example clients and
servers.

Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform created by [Uber Technologies](https://eng.uber.com/distributed-tracing/) and donated to [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io).

See Jaeger [documentation][doc] for getting started, operational details, and other information.

Jaeger is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as the 7th top-level project, graduated in October 2019. See the CNCF [Jaeger incubation announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/09/13/cncf-hosts-jaeger/) and [Jaeger graduation announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2019/10/31/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-jaeger-graduation/).

## Get Involved

Jaeger is an open source project with open governance. We welcome contributions from the community, and we would love your help to improve and extend the project. Here are [some ideas](https://www.jaegertracing.io/get-involved/) for how to get involved. Many of them do not even require any coding.

## Version Compatibility Guarantees

Since Jaeger uses many components from the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/) we try to maintain configuration compatibility between Jaeger releases. Occasionally, configuration options in Jaeger (or in Jaeger v1 CLI flags) can be deprecated due to usability improvements, new functionality, or changes in our dependencies.
In such situations, developers introducing the deprecation are required to follow [these guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md#deprecating-cli-flags).

In short, for a deprecated configuration option, you should expect to see the following message in the documentation or release notes:
```
(deprecated, will be removed after yyyy-mm-dd or in release vX.Y.Z, whichever is later)
```

A grace period of at least **3 months** or **two minor version bumps** (whichever is later) from the first release
containing the deprecation notice will be provided before the deprecated configuration option _can_ be deleted.

For example, consider a scenario where v2.0.0 is released on 01-Sep-2024 containing a deprecation notice for a configuration option.
This configuration option will remain in a deprecated state until the later of 01-Dec-2024 or v2.2.0 where it _can_ be removed on or after either of those events.
It may remain deprecated for longer than the aforementioned grace period.

## Go Version Compatibility Guarantees

The Jaeger project attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.

Starting with the release of Go 1.21, support for Go versions will be updated as follows:

1. Soon after the release of a new Go minor version `N`, updates will be made to the build and tests steps to accommodate the latest Go minor version.
2. Soon after the release of a new Go minor version `N`, support for Go version `N-2` will be removed and version `N-1` will become the minimum required version.

Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by \*NIX kernels, written
in Go with pluggable metric collectors.

The [Windows exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter) is recommended for Windows users.
To expose NVIDIA GPU metrics, [prometheus-dcgm
](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter)
can be used.

## Installation and Usage

If you are new to Prometheus and `node_exporter` there is a [simple step-by-step guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/).

The `node_exporter` listens on HTTP port 9100 by default. See the `--help` output for more options.

### Ansible

For automated installs with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), there is the [Prometheus Community role](https://github.com/prometheus-community/ansible).

### Docker

The `node_exporter` is designed to monitor the host system. Deploying in containers requires
extra care in order to avoid monitoring the container itself.

For situations where containerized deployment is needed, some extra flags must be used to allow
the `node_exporter` access to the host namespaces.

Be aware that any non-root mount points you want to monitor will need to be bind-mounted
into the container.

If you start container for host monitoring, specify `path.rootfs` argument.
This argument must match path in bind-mount of host root. The node\_exporter will use
`path.rootfs` as prefix to access host filesystem.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --net=&quot;host&quot; \
  --pid=&quot;host&quot; \
  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot; \
  quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest \
  --path.rootfs=/host
```

For Docker compose, similar flag changes are needed.

```yaml
---
version: &#039;3.8&#039;

services:
  node_exporter:
    image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest
    container_name: node_exporter
    command:
      - &#039;--path.rootfs=/host&#039;
    network_mode: host
    pid: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - &#039;/:/host:ro,rslave&#039;
```

On some systems, the `timex` collector requires an additional Docker flag,
`--cap-add=SYS_TIME`, in order to access the required syscalls.

## Collectors

There is varying support for collectors on each operating system. The tables
below list all existing collectors and the supported systems.

Collectors are enabled by providing a `--collector.&lt;name&gt;` flag.
Collectors that are enabled by default can be disabled by providing a `--no-collector.&lt;name&gt;` flag.
To enable only some specific collector(s), use `--collector.disable-defaults --collector.&lt;name&gt; ...`.

### Include &amp; Exclude flags

A few collectors can be configured to include or exclude certain patterns using dedicated flags. The exclude flags are used to indicate &quot;all except&quot;, while the include flags are used to say &quot;none except&quot;. Note that these flags are mutually exclusive on collectors that support both.

Example:

```txt
--collector.filesystem.mount-points-exclude=^/(dev|proc|sys|var/lib/docker/.+|var/lib/kubelet/.+)($|/)
```

### Disabled by default

`node_exporter` also implements a number of collectors that are disabled by default.  Reasons for this vary by
collector, and may include:
* High cardinality
* Prolonged runtime that exceeds the Prometheus `scrape_interval` or `scrape_timeout`
* Significant resource demands on the host

You can enable additional collectors as desired by adding them to your
init system&#039;s or service supervisor&#039;s startup configuration for
`node_exporter` but caution is advised.  Enable at most one at a time,
testing first on a non-production system, then by hand on a single
production node.  When enabling additional collectors, you should
carefully monitor the change by observing the `
scrape_duration_seconds` metric to ensure that collection completes
and does not time out.  In addition, monitor the
`scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` metric to see the changes in
cardinality.

### Perf Collector

The `perf` collector may not work out of the box on some Linux systems due to kernel
configuration and security settings. To allow access, set the following `sysctl`
parameter:

```
sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=X
```

- 2 allow only user-space measurements (default since Linux 4.6).
- 1 allow both kernel and user measurements (default before Linux 4.6).
- 0 allow access to CPU-specific data but not raw tracepoint samples.
- -1 no restrictions.

Depending on the configured value different metrics will be available, for most
cases `0` will provide the most complete set. For more information see [`man 2
perf_event_open`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html).

By default, the `perf` collector will only collect metrics of the CPUs that
`node_exporter` is running on (ie
[`runtime.NumCPU`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#NumCPU). If this is
insufficient (e.g. if you run `node_exporter` with its CPU affinity set to
specific CPUs), you can specify a list of alternate CPUs by using the
`--collector.perf.cpus` flag. For example, to collect metrics on CPUs 2-6, you
would specify: `--collector.perf --collector.perf.cpus=2-6`. The CPU
configuration is zero indexed and can also take a stride value; e.g.
`--collector.perf --collector.perf.cpus=1-10:5` would collect on CPUs
1, 5, and 10.

The `perf` collector is also able to collect
[tracepoint](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/tracepoint.html)
counts when using the `--collector.perf.tracepoint` flag. Tracepoints can be
found using [`perf list`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/perf.1.html) or
from debugfs. And example usage of this would be
`--collector.perf.tracepoint=&quot;sched:sched_process_exec&quot;`.

### Sysctl Collector

The `sysctl` collector can be enabled with `--collector.sysctl`. It supports exposing numeric sysctl values
as metrics using the `--collector.sysctl.include` flag and string values as info metrics by using the
`--collector.sysctl.include-info` flag. The flags can be repeated. For sysctl with multiple numeric values,
an optional mapping can be given to expose each value as its own metric. Otherwise an `index` label is used
to identify the different fields.

#### Examples
##### Numeric values
###### Single values
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=vm.user_reserve_kbytes`:
`vm.user_reserve_kbytes = 131072` -&gt; `node_sysctl_vm_user_reserve_kbytes 131072`

###### Multiple values
A sysctl can contain multiple values, for example:
```
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096	131072	6291456
```
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=net.ipv4.tcp_rmem` the collector will expose:
```
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;0&quot;} 4096
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;1&quot;} 131072
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;2&quot;} 6291456
```
If the indexes have defined meaning like in this case, the values can be mapped to multiple metrics by appending the mapping to the --collector.sysctl.include flag:
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=net.ipv4.tcp_rmem:min,default,max` the collector will expose:
```
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_min 4096
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_default 131072
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_max 6291456
```

##### String values
String values need to be exposed as info metric. The user selects them by using the `--collector.sysctl.include-info` flag.

###### Single values
`kernel.core_pattern = core` -&gt; `node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.core_pattern_info&quot;, value=&quot;core&quot;} 1`

###### Multiple values
Given the following sysctl:
```
kernel.seccomp.actions_avail = kill_process kill_thread trap errno trace log allow
```
Setting `--collector.sysctl.include-info=kernel.seccomp.actions_avail` will yield:
```
node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.seccomp.actions_avail&quot;, index=&quot;0&quot;, value=&quot;kill_process&quot;} 1
node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.seccomp.actions_avail&quot;, index=&quot;1&quot;, value=&quot;kill_thread&quot;} 1
...
```

### Textfile Collector

The `textfile` collector is similar to the [Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway),
in that it allows exporting of statistics from batch jobs. It can also be used
to export static metrics, such as what role a machine has. The Pushgateway
should be used for service-level metrics. The `textfile` module is for metrics
that are tied to a machine.

To use it, set the `--collector.textfile.directory` flag on the `node_exporter` commandline. The
collector will parse all files in that directory matching the glob `*.prom`
using the [text
format](http://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). **Note:** Timestamps are not supported.

To atomically push completion time for a cron job:
```
echo my_batch_job_completion_time $(date +%s) &gt; /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom.$$
mv /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom.$$ /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom
```

To statically set roles for a machine using labels:
```
echo &#039;role{role=&quot;application_server&quot;} 1&#039; &gt; /path/to/directory/role.prom.$$
mv /path/to/directory/role.prom.$$ /path/to/directory/role.prom
```

### Filtering enabled collectors

The `node_exporter` will expose all metrics from enabled collectors by default.  This is the recommended way to collect metrics to avoid errors when comparing metrics of different families.

For advanced use the `node_exporter` can be passed an optional list of collectors to filter metrics. The parameters `collect[]` and `exclude[]` can be used multiple times (but cannot be combined).  In Prometheus configuration you can use this syntax under the [scrape config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#&lt;scrape_config&gt;).

Collect only `cpu` and `meminfo` collector metrics:
```
  params:
    collect[]:
      - cpu
      - meminfo
```

Collect all enabled collector metrics but exclude `netdev`:
```
  params:
    exclude[]:
      - netdev
```

This can be useful for having different Prometheus servers collect specific metrics from nodes.

## Elevator Pitch

Rant time: You&#039;ve heard it before, git is _powerful_, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? _Are you kidding me?_ To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can&#039;t be split down any further but contains code you don&#039;t want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file _by hand_? _Are you KIDDING me?!_ Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren&#039;t even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? _YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!_

If you&#039;re a mere mortal like me and you&#039;re tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it&#039;s a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.

## Features

### Stage individual lines

Press space on the selected line to stage it, or press `v` to start selecting a range of lines. You can also press `a` to select the entirety of the current hunk.

![stage_lines](../assets/demo/stage_lines-compressed.gif)

### Interactive Rebase

Press `i` to start an interactive rebase. Then squash (`s`), fixup (`f`), drop (`d`), edit (`e`), move up (`ctrl+k`) or move down (`ctrl+j`) any of TODO commits, before continuing the rebase by bringing up the rebase options menu with `m` and then selecting `continue`.

You can also perform any these actions as a once-off (e.g. pressing `s` on a commit to squash it) without explicitly starting a rebase.

This demo also uses shift+down to select a range of commits to move and fixup.

![interactive_rebase](../assets/demo/interactive_rebase-compressed.gif)

### Cherry-pick

Press `shift+c` on a commit to copy it and press `shift+v` to paste (cherry-pick) it.

![cherry_pick](../assets/demo/cherry_pick-compressed.gif)

### Bisect

Press `b` in the commits view to mark a commit as good/bad in order to begin a git bisect.

![bisect](../assets/demo/bisect-compressed.gif)

### Nuke the working tree

For when you really want to just get rid of anything that shows up when you run `git status` (and yes that includes dirty submodules) [kidpix style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4E2B_k2Bss), press `shift+d` to bring up the reset options menu and then select the &#039;nuke&#039; option.

![Nuke working tree](../assets/demo/nuke_working_tree-compressed.gif)

### Amend an old commit

Pressing `shift+a` on any commit will amend that commit with the currently staged changes (running an interactive rebase in the background).

Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields based on tags.

It has the following **unique** features:

-   Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or custom validators.
-   Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a multidimensional field to be validated.
-   Ability to dive into both map keys and values for validation
-   Handles type interface by determining it&#039;s underlying type prior to validation.
-   Handles custom field types such as sql driver Valuer see [Valuer](https://golang.org/src/database/sql/driver/types.go?s=1210:1293#L29)
-   Alias validation tags, which allows for mapping of several validations to a single tag for easier defining of validations on structs
-   Extraction of custom defined Field Name e.g. can specify to extract the JSON name while validating and have it available in the resulting FieldError
-   Customizable i18n aware error messages.
-   Default validator for the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework; upgrading from v8 to v9 in gin see [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/master/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding)

A Call for Maintainers
----------------------

Please read the discussiong started [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/discussions/1330) if you are interested in contributing/helping maintain this package.

Installation
------------

Use go get.

	go get github.com/go-playground/validator/v10

Then import the validator package into your own code.

	import &quot;github.com/go-playground/validator/v10&quot;

Error Return Value
-------

Validation functions return type error

They return type error to avoid the issue discussed in the following, where err is always != nil:

* http://stackoverflow.com/a/29138676/3158232
* https://github.com/go-playground/validator/issues/134

Validator returns only InvalidValidationError for bad validation input, nil or ValidationErrors as type error; so, in your code all you need to do is check if the error returned is not nil, and if it&#039;s not check if error is InvalidValidationError ( if necessary, most of the time it isn&#039;t ) type cast it to type ValidationErrors like so:

```go
err := validate.Struct(mystruct)
validationErrors := err.(validator.ValidationErrors)
 ```

Usage and documentation
------

Please see https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 for detailed usage docs.

##### Examples:

- [Simple](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/simple/main.go)
- [Custom Field Types](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/custom/main.go)
- [Struct Level](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/struct-level/main.go)
- [Translations &amp; Custom Errors](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/translations/main.go)
- [Gin upgrade and/or override validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/v9/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding)
- [wash - an example application putting it all together](https://github.com/bluesuncorp/wash)

Baked-in Validations
------

### Special Notes:
- If new to using validator it is highly recommended to initialize it using the `WithRequiredStructEnabled` option which is opt-in to new behaviour that will become the default behaviour in v11+. See documentation for more details.
```go
validate := validator.New(validator.WithRequiredStructEnabled())
```

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask AI about Agent Deck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

**Option 1: Claude Code Skill** (recommended for Claude Code users)
```bash
/plugin marketplace add asheshgoplani/agent-deck
/plugin install agent-deck@agent-deck-help
```
Then ask: *&quot;How do I set up MCP pooling?&quot;*

**Option 2: OpenCode** (has built-in Claude skill compatibility)
```bash
# Create skill directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/agent-deck/references

# Download skill and references
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/skills/agent-deck/SKILL.md \
  &gt; ~/.claude/skills/agent-deck/SKILL.md
for f in cli-reference config-reference tui-reference troubleshooting; do
  curl -sL &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/skills/agent-deck/references/${f}.md&quot; \
    &gt; ~/.claude/skills/agent-deck/references/${f}.md
done
```
OpenCode will auto-discover the skill from `~/.claude/skills/`.

**Option 3: Any LLM** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/llms-full.txt
and answer: How do I fork a session?
```

&lt;/details&gt;

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4f55917-435c-45ba-92cc-89737d0d1401

## The Problem

Running Claude Code on 10 projects? OpenCode on 5 more? Another agent somewhere in the background?

**Managing multiple AI sessions gets messy fast.** Too many terminal tabs. Hard to track what&#039;s running, what&#039;s waiting, what&#039;s done. Switching between projects means hunting through windows.

## The Solution

**Agent Deck is mission control for your AI coding agents.**

One terminal. All your agents. Complete visibility.

- **See everything at a glance** — running, waiting, or idle status for every agent instantly
- **Switch in milliseconds** — jump between any session with a single keystroke
- **Stay organized** — groups, search, notifications, and git worktrees keep everything manageable

## Features

### Fork Sessions

Try different approaches without losing context. Fork any Claude conversation instantly. Each fork inherits the full conversation history.

- Press `f` for quick fork, `F` to customize name/group
- Fork your forks to explore as many branches as you need

### MCP Manager

Attach MCP servers without touching config files. Need web search? Browser automation? Toggle them on per project or globally. Agent Deck handles the restart automatically.

- Press `M` to open, `Space` to toggle, `Tab` to cycle scope (LOCAL/GLOBAL)
- Define your MCPs once in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`, then toggle per session — see [Configuration Reference](skills/agent-deck/references/config-reference.md)

### MCP Socket Pool

Running many sessions? Socket pooling shares MCP processes across all sessions via Unix sockets, reducing MCP memory usage by 85-90%. Connections auto-recover from MCP crashes in ~3 seconds via a reconnecting proxy. Enable with `pool_all = true` in [config.toml](skills/agent-deck/references/config-reference.md).

### Search

Press `/` to fuzzy-search across all sessions. Filter by status with `!` (running), `@` (waiting), `#` (idle), `$` (error). Press `G` for global search across all Claude conversations.

### Status Detection

Smart polling detects what every agent is doing right now:

| Status | Symbol | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Running** | `●` green | Agent is actively working |
| **Waiting** | `◐` yellow | Needs your input |
| **Idle** | `○` gray | Ready for commands |
| **Error** | `✕` red | Something went wrong |

### Notification Bar

Waiting sessions appear right in your tmux status bar. Press `Ctrl+b 1-6` to jump directly to them.

```
⚡ [1] frontend [2] api [3] backend
```

### Git Worktrees

Multiple agents can work on the same repo without conflicts. Each worktree is an isolated working directory with its own branch.

- `agent-deck add . -c claude --worktree feature/a --new-branch` creates a session in a new worktree
- `agent-deck add . --worktree feature/b -b --location subdirectory` places the worktree under `.worktrees/` inside the repo
- `agent-deck worktree finish &quot;My Session&quot;` merges the branch, removes the worktree, and deletes the session
- `agent-deck worktree cleanup` finds and removes orphaned worktrees

Configure the default worktree location in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`:

```toml
[worktree]
default_location = &quot;subdirectory&quot;  # &quot;sibling&quot; (default), &quot;subdirectory&quot;, or a custom path
```

`sibling` creates worktrees next to the repo (`repo-branch`). `subdirectory` creates them inside it (`repo/.worktrees/branch`). A custom path like `~/worktrees` or `/tmp/worktrees` creates repo-namespaced worktrees at `&lt;path&gt;/&lt;repo_name&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;`. The `--location` flag overrides the config per session.

### Conductor

Conductors are persistent Claude Code sessions that monitor and orchestrate all your other sessions. They watch for sessions that need help, auto-respond when confident, and escalate to you when they can&#039;t. Optionally connect Telegram for mobile control.

Create as many conductors as you need per profile:

```bash
# First-time setup (asks about Telegram, then creates the conductor)
agent-deck -p work conductor setup ops --description &quot;Ops monitor&quot;

# Add more conductors to the same profile (no prompts)
agent-deck -p work conductor setup infra --no-heartbeat --description &quot;Infra watcher&quot;
agent-deck conductor setup personal --description &quot;Personal project monitor&quot;
```

Each conductor gets its own directory, identity, and heartbeat settings:

```
~/.agent-deck/conductor/
├── CLAUDE.md           # Shared knowledge (CLI ref, protocols, rules)
├── bridge.py           # Telegram bridge (if configured)
├── ops/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md       # Identity: &quot;You are ops, a conductor for the work profile&quot;
│   ├── meta.json       # Config: name, profile, heartbeat, description
│   ├── state.json      # Runtime state
│   └── task-log.md     # Action log
└── infra/
    ├── CLAUDE.md
    └── meta.json
```

**CLI commands:**

```bash
agent-deck conductor list                    # List all conductors
agent-deck conductor list --profile work     # Filter by profile
agent-deck conductor status                  # Health check (all)
agent-deck conductor status ops              # Health check (specific)
agent-deck conductor teardown ops            # Stop a conductor
agent-deck conductor teardown --all --remove # Remove everything
```

**Telegram bridge** (optional): Connect a Telegram bot for mobile monitoring. The bridge routes messages to specific conductors using a `name: message` prefix:

```
ops: check the frontend session      → routes to conductor-ops
infra: restart all error sessions    → routes to conductor-infra
/status                              → broadcasts to all conductors
```

**Heartbeat**: Conductors with heartbeat enabled receive periodic check-in prompts, keeping them actively monitoring your sessions. Disable per conductor with `--no-heartbeat`.

### Multi-Tool Support

Agent Deck works with any terminal-based AI tool:

| Tool | Integration Level |
|------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Full (status, MCP, fork, resume) |
| **Gemini CLI** | Full (status, MCP, resume) |
| **OpenCode** | Status detection, organization |
| **Codex** | Status detection, organization |
| **Cursor** (terminal) | Status detection, organization |
| **Custom tools** | Configurable via `[tools.*]` in config.toml |

### Updates

Agent Deck checks for updates automatically. Run `agent-deck update` to install, or set `auto_update = true` in [config.toml](skills/agent-deck/references/config-reference.md) for automatic updates.

## FAQ

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;How is this different from just using tmux?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Agent Deck adds AI-specific intelligence on top of tmux: smart status detection (knows when Claude is thinking vs. waiting), session forking with context inheritance, MCP management, global search across conversations, and organized groups. Think of it as tmux plus AI awareness.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I use it on Windows?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), then run the installer inside WSL. WSL2 is recommended for full feature support including MCP socket pooling.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will it interfere with my existing tmux setup?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

No. Agent Deck creates its own tmux sessions with the prefix `agentdeck_*`. Your existing sessions are untouched. The installer backs up your `~/.tmux.conf` before adding optional config, and you can skip it with `--skip-tmux-config`.

&lt;/details&gt;

## The fastest way to build AI applications that never go down

Bifrost is a high-performance AI gateway that unifies access to 15+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, and more) through a single OpenAI-compatible API. Deploy in seconds with zero configuration and get automatic failover, load balancing, semantic caching, and enterprise-grade features.

## Quick Start

![Get started](./docs/media/getting-started.png)

**Go from zero to production-ready AI gateway in under a minute.**

**Step 1:** Start Bifrost Gateway

```bash
# Install and run locally
npx -y @maximhq/bifrost

# Or use Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 maximhq/bifrost
```

**Step 2:** Configure via Web UI

```bash
# Open the built-in web interface
open http://localhost:8080
```

**Step 3:** Make your first API call

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;openai/gpt-4o-mini&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, Bifrost!&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

**That&#039;s it!** Your AI gateway is running with a web interface for visual configuration, real-time monitoring, and analytics.

containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.

containerd is a member of CNCF with [&#039;graduated&#039;](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=containerd) status.

containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being used directly by developers or end-users.

![architecture](docs/historical/design/architecture.png)

## Announcements

### containerd v2.0 is now released!
See [`docs/containerd-2.0.md`](docs/containerd-2.0.md).

### Now Recruiting

We are a large inclusive OSS project that is welcoming help of any kind shape or form:
* Documentation help is needed to make the product easier to consume and extend.
* We need OSS community outreach/organizing help to get the word out; manage
and create messaging and educational content; and help with social media, community forums/groups, and google groups.
* We are actively inviting new [security advisors](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#security-advisors) to join the team.
* New subprojects are being created, core and non-core that could use additional development help.
* Each of the [containerd projects](https://github.com/containerd) has a list of issues currently being worked on or that need help resolving.
  - If the issue has not already been assigned to someone or has not made recent progress, and you are interested, please inquire.
  - If you are interested in starting with a smaller/beginner-level issue, look for issues with an `exp/beginner` tag, for example [containerd/containerd beginner issues.](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aexp%2Fbeginner)

## Getting Started

See our documentation on [containerd.io](https://containerd.io):
* [for ops and admins](docs/ops.md)
* [namespaces](docs/namespaces.md)
* [client options](docs/client-opts.md)

To get started contributing to containerd, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are interested in trying out containerd see our example at [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Nightly builds

There are nightly builds available for download [here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/actions?query=workflow%3ANightly).
Binaries are generated from `main` branch every night for `Linux` and `Windows`.

Please be aware: nightly builds might have critical bugs, it&#039;s not recommended for use in production and no support provided.

## Kubernetes (k8s) CI Dashboard Group

The [k8s CI dashboard group for containerd](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd) contains test results regarding
the health of kubernetes when run against main and a number of containerd release branches.

- [containerd-periodics](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd-periodic)

## Runtime Requirements

Runtime requirements for containerd are very minimal. Most interactions with
the Linux and Windows container feature sets are handled via [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) and/or
OS-specific libraries (e.g. [hcsshim](https://github.com/Microsoft/hcsshim) for Microsoft).
The current required version of `runc` is described in [RUNC.md](docs/RUNC.md).

There are specific features
used by containerd core code and snapshotters that will require a minimum kernel
version on Linux. With the understood caveat of distro kernel versioning, a
reasonable starting point for Linux is a minimum 4.x kernel version.

The overlay filesystem snapshotter, used by default, uses features that were
finalized in the 4.x kernel series. If you choose to use btrfs, there may
be more flexibility in kernel version (minimum recommended is 3.18), but will
require the btrfs kernel module and btrfs tools to be installed on your Linux
distribution.

To use Linux checkpoint and restore features, you will need `criu` installed on
your system. See more details in [Checkpoint and Restore](#checkpoint-and-restore).

Build requirements for developers are listed in [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).


## Supported Registries

Any registry which is compliant with the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)
is supported by containerd.

For configuring registries, see [registry host configuration documentation](docs/hosts.md)

## Features

For a detailed overview of containerd&#039;s core concepts and the features it supports,
please refer to the [FEATURES.MD](./docs/features.md) document.

### Releases and API Stability

Please see [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for details on versioning and stability
of containerd components.

Downloadable 64-bit Intel/AMD binaries of all official releases are available on
our [releases page](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases).

For other architectures and distribution support, you will find that many
Linux distributions package their own containerd and provide it across several
architectures, such as [Canonical&#039;s Ubuntu packaging](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+package/containerd).

#### Enabling command auto-completion

Starting with containerd 1.4, the urfave client feature for auto-creation of bash and zsh
autocompletion data is enabled. To use the autocomplete feature in a bash shell for example, source
the autocomplete/ctr file in your `.bashrc`, or manually like:

```
$ source ./contrib/autocomplete/ctr
```

#### Distribution of `ctr` autocomplete for bash and zsh

For bash, copy the `contrib/autocomplete/ctr` script into
`/etc/bash_completion.d/` and rename it to `ctr`. The `zsh_autocomplete`
file is also available and can be used similarly for zsh users.

Provide documentation to users to `source` this file into their shell if
you don&#039;t place the autocomplete file in a location where it is automatically
loaded for the user&#039;s shell environment.

### CRI

`cri` is a [containerd](https://containerd.io/) plugin implementation of the Kubernetes [container runtime interface (CRI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api/blob/master/pkg/apis/runtime/v1/api.proto). With it, you are able to use containerd as the container runtime for a Kubernetes cluster.

![cri](./docs/cri/cri.png)

#### CRI Status

`cri` is a native plugin of containerd. Since containerd 1.1, the cri plugin is built into the release binaries and enabled by default.

The `cri` plugin has reached GA status, representing that it is:
* Feature complete
* Works with Kubernetes 1.10 and above
* Passes all [CRI validation tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/cri-validation.md).
* Passes all [node e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/e2e-node-tests.md).
* Passes all [e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/e2e-tests.md).

See results on the containerd k8s [test dashboard](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd)

#### Validating Your `cri` Setup
A Kubernetes incubator project, [cri-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools), includes programs for exercising CRI implementations. More importantly, cri-tools includes the program `critest` which is used for running [CRI Validation Testing](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/cri-validation.md).

#### CRI Guides

A lightweight and portable command-line YAML, JSON, INI and XML processor. `yq` uses [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) (a popular JSON processor) like syntax but works with yaml files as well as json, kyaml, xml, ini, properties, csv and tsv. It doesn&#039;t yet support everything `jq` does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more is being added continuously.

yq is written in Go - so you can download a dependency free binary for your platform and you are good to go! If you prefer there are a variety of package managers that can be used as well as Docker and Podman, all listed below.

## Quick Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

**Read a value:**
```bash
yq &#039;.a.b[0].c&#039; file.yaml
```

**Pipe from STDIN:**
```bash
yq &#039;.a.b[0].c&#039; &lt; file.yaml
```

**Update a yaml file in place:**
```bash
yq -i &#039;.a.b[0].c = &quot;cool&quot;&#039; file.yaml
```

**Update using environment variables:**
```bash
NAME=mike yq -i &#039;.a.b[0].c = strenv(NAME)&#039; file.yaml
```

### Advanced Operations

**Merge multiple files:**
```bash
# merge two files
yq -n &#039;load(&quot;file1.yaml&quot;) * load(&quot;file2.yaml&quot;)&#039;

# merge using globs (note: `ea` evaluates all files at once instead of in sequence)
yq ea &#039;. as $item ireduce ({}; . * $item )&#039; path/to/*.yml
```

**Multiple updates to a yaml file:**
```bash
yq -i &#039;
  .a.b[0].c = &quot;cool&quot; |
  .x.y.z = &quot;foobar&quot; |
  .person.name = strenv(NAME)
&#039; file.yaml
```

**Find and update an item in an array:**
```bash
# Note: requires input file - add your file at the end
yq -i &#039;(.[] | select(.name == &quot;foo&quot;) | .address) = &quot;12 cat st&quot;&#039; data.yaml
```

**Convert between formats:**
```bash
# Convert JSON to YAML (pretty print)
yq -Poy sample.json

# Convert YAML to JSON
yq -o json file.yaml

# Convert XML to YAML
yq -o yaml file.xml
```

See [recipes](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/recipes) for more examples and the [documentation](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) for more information.

## Install

### [Download the latest binary](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest)

### wget
Use wget to download pre-compiled binaries. Choose your platform and architecture:

**For Linux (example):**
```bash
# Set your platform variables (adjust as needed)
VERSION=v4.2.0
PLATFORM=linux_amd64

# Download compressed binary
wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/${VERSION}/yq_${PLATFORM}.tar.gz -O - |\
  tar xz &amp;&amp; sudo mv yq_${PLATFORM} /usr/local/bin/yq

# Or download plain binary
wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/${VERSION}/yq_${PLATFORM} -O /usr/local/bin/yq &amp;&amp;\
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yq
```

**Latest version (Linux AMD64):**
```bash
wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/yq &amp;&amp;\
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yq
```

**Available platforms:** `linux_amd64`, `linux_arm64`, `linux_arm`, `linux_386`, `darwin_amd64`, `darwin_arm64`, `windows_amd64`, `windows_386`, etc.

### MacOS / Linux via Homebrew:
Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
brew install yq
```

### Linux via snap:
```
snap install yq
```

#### Snap notes
`yq` installs with [_strict confinement_](https://docs.snapcraft.io/snap-confinement/6233) in snap, this means it doesn&#039;t have direct access to root files. To read root files you can:

```
sudo cat /etc/myfile | yq &#039;.a.path&#039;
```

And to write to a root file you can either use [sponge](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sponge):
```
sudo cat /etc/myfile | yq &#039;.a.path = &quot;value&quot;&#039; | sudo sponge /etc/myfile
```
or write to a temporary file:
```
sudo cat /etc/myfile | yq &#039;.a.path = &quot;value&quot;&#039; | sudo tee /etc/myfile.tmp
sudo mv /etc/myfile.tmp /etc/myfile
rm /etc/myfile.tmp
```

### Run with Docker or Podman

#### One-time use:
```bash
# Docker - process files in current directory
docker run --rm -v &quot;${PWD}&quot;:/workdir mikefarah/yq &#039;.a.b[0].c&#039; file.yaml

# Podman - same usage as Docker
podman run --rm -v &quot;${PWD}&quot;:/workdir mikefarah/yq &#039;.a.b[0].c&#039; file.yaml
```

**Security note:** You can run `yq` in Docker with restricted privileges:
```bash
docker run --rm --security-opt=no-new-privileges --cap-drop all --network none \
  -v &quot;${PWD}&quot;:/workdir mikefarah/yq &#039;.a.b[0].c&#039; file.yaml
```

#### Pipe data via STDIN:

You&#039;ll need to pass the `-i --interactive` flag to Docker/Podman:

```bash
# Process piped data
docker run -i --rm mikefarah/yq &#039;.this.thing&#039; &lt; myfile.yml

# Same with Podman
podman run -i --rm mikefarah/yq &#039;.this.thing&#039; &lt; myfile.yml
```

#### Run commands interactively:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v &quot;${PWD}&quot;:/workdir --entrypoint sh mikefarah/yq
```

```bash
podman run --rm -it -v &quot;${PWD}&quot;:/workdir --entrypoint sh mikefarah/yq
```

It can be useful to have a bash function to avoid typing the whole docker command:

```bash
yq() {
  docker run --rm -i -v &quot;${PWD}&quot;:/workdir mikefarah/yq &quot;$@&quot;
}
```

```bash
yq() {
  podman run --rm -i -v &quot;${PWD}&quot;:/workdir mikefarah/yq &quot;$@&quot;
}
```
#### Running as root:

`yq`&#039;s container image no longer runs under root (https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/pull/860). If you&#039;d like to install more things in the container image, or you&#039;re having permissions issues when attempting to read/write files you&#039;ll need to either:


```
docker run --user=&quot;root&quot; -it --entrypoint sh mikefarah/yq
```

```
podman run --user=&quot;root&quot; -it --entrypoint sh mikefarah/yq
```

Or, in your Dockerfile:

```
FROM mikefarah/yq

USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache bash
USER yq
```

#### Missing timezone data
By default, the alpine image yq uses does not include timezone data. If you&#039;d like to use the `tz` operator, you&#039;ll need to include this data:

```
FROM mikefarah/yq

USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache tzdata
USER yq
```

#### Podman with SELinux

If you are using podman with SELinux, you will need to set the shared volume flag `:z` on the volume mount:

```
-v &quot;${PWD}&quot;:/workdir:z
```

### GitHub Action
```
  - name: Set foobar to cool
    uses: mikefarah/yq@master
    with:
      cmd: yq -i &#039;.foo.bar = &quot;cool&quot;&#039; &#039;config.yml&#039;
  - name: Get an entry with a variable that might contain dots or spaces
    id: get_username

    with:
      cmd: yq &#039;.all.children.[&quot;${{ matrix.ip_address }}&quot;].username&#039; ops/inventories/production.yml
  - name: Reuse a variable obtained in another step
    run: echo ${{ steps.get_username.outputs.result }}
```

Examples:

# yq tries to auto-detect the file format based off the extension, and defaults to YAML if it&#039;s unknown (or piping through STDIN)
# Use the &#039;-p/--input-format&#039; flag to specify a format type.
cat file.xml | yq -p xml

# read the &quot;stuff&quot; node from &quot;myfile.yml&quot;
yq &#039;.stuff&#039; &lt; myfile.yml

# update myfile.yml in place
yq -i &#039;.stuff = &quot;foo&quot;&#039; myfile.yml

# print contents of sample.json as idiomatic YAML

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PowerShell quoting issues:**
```powershell
# Use single quotes for expressions
yq &#039;.a.b[0].c&#039; file.yaml

# Or escape double quotes
yq &quot;.a.b[0].c = \&quot;value\&quot;&quot; file.yaml
```

### Getting Help

- **Check existing issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/issues)
- **Ask questions**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/discussions)
- **Documentation**: [Complete documentation](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/)
- **Examples**: [Recipes and examples](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/recipes)

## Known Issues / Missing Features
- `yq` attempts to preserve comment positions and whitespace as much as possible, but it does not handle all scenarios (see https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v3 for details)
- Powershell has its own...[opinions on quoting yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/usage/tips-and-tricks#quotes-in-windows-powershell)
- &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; were dropped as boolean values in the yaml 1.2 standard - which is the standard yq assumes.

See [tips and tricks](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/usage/tips-and-tricks) for more common problems and solutions.

## About

The gRPC-Gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler
[protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).
It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which
translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the
[`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotations in your service definitions.

This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.

## Docs

You can read our docs at:

- https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/

## Testimonials

&gt; We use the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of API requests per day,
&gt; and have been since 2018 and through all of that,
&gt; we have never had any issues with it.
&gt;
&gt; _- William Mill, [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/)_

## Background

gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming
languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is
combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional
RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining
backward-compatibility, supporting languages or clients that are not well supported by
gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful
JSON architecture.

This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.
A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all
that&#039;s needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.

## Installation

### Compile from source

The following instructions assume you are using
[Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) for dependency
management. Use a
[tool dependency](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
to track the versions of the following executable packages:

```go
// +build tools

package tools

import (
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot;
)
```

Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running

```sh
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### **Using the `tool` Directive in Go 1.24**

Starting from Go 1.24, the `tool` directive in `go.mod` provides a structured way to track and manage executable dependencies. This replaces the previous workaround of using a separate `tools.go` file with blank imports.

#### **Tracking Tools in `go.mod`**

Instead of manually importing tool dependencies in a Go source file, you can now use the `tool` directive in `go.mod` to declare the tools your project depends on. For example:

```go
module tools

go 1.24

tool (
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
	google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
	google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
)
```

#### **Managing Tool Dependencies**

To add tools to your module, use the `-tool` flag with `go get`:

```sh
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
go get -tool google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
go get -tool google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This automatically updates `go.mod`, adding the tools under the `tool` directive along with `require` statements to ensure version tracking.

### Install Tools

Once the tool dependencies are properly recorded in the `go.mod` file, simply execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
go install tool
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### Download the binaries

You may alternatively download the binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
We generate [SLSA3 signatures](slsa.dev) using the OpenSSF&#039;s [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) during the release process. To verify a release binary:

1. Install the verification tool from [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation).
2. Download the provenance file `attestation.intoto.jsonl` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
3. Run the verifier:

```shell
slsa-verifier -artifact-path &lt;the-binary&gt; -provenance attestation.intoto.jsonl -source github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway -tag &lt;the-tag&gt;
```

Alternatively, see the section on remotely managed plugin versions below.

## Usage

### 1.Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers

`your_service.proto`:

```protobuf
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;

 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
   rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
 }
```

### 2. Generate gRPC stubs

This step generates the gRPC stubs that you can use to implement the service and consume from clients:

Here&#039;s an example `buf.gen.yaml` you can use to generate the stubs with [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf):

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

With this file in place, you can generate your files using `buf generate`.

&gt; For a complete example of using `buf generate` to generate protobuf stubs, see
&gt; [the boilerplate repo](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).
&gt; For more information on generating the stubs with buf, see
&gt; [the official documentation](https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage).

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, here&#039;s an example of what a command
might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . \
    --go_out ./gen/go/ --go_opt paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out ./gen/go/ --go-grpc_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 3. Implement your service in gRPC as usual.

### 4. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

At this point, you have 3 options:

- no further modifications, use the default mapping to HTTP semantics (method, path, etc.)
  - this will work on any `.proto` file, but will not allow setting HTTP paths, request parameters or similar
- additional `.proto` modifications to use a custom mapping
  - relies on parameters in the `.proto` file to set custom HTTP mappings
- no `.proto` modifications, but use an external configuration file
  - relies on an external configuration file to set custom HTTP mappings
  - mostly useful when the source proto file isn&#039;t under your control

#### 1. Using the default mapping

This requires no additional modification to the `.proto` file but does require enabling a specific option when executing the plugin.
The `generate_unbound_methods` should be enabled.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt generate_unbound_methods=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 2. With custom annotations

Add a [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotation to your .proto file

`your_service.proto`:

```diff
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;
+
+import &quot;google/api/annotations.proto&quot;;
+
 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
-  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
+  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
+    option (google.api.http) = {
+      post: &quot;/v1/example/echo&quot;
+      body: &quot;*&quot;
+    };
+  }
 }
```

&gt; You will need to provide the required third party protobuf files to the protobuf compiler.
&gt; If you are using [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf), this dependency can
&gt; be added to the `deps` array in your `buf.yaml` under the name
&gt; `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis`:
&gt;
&gt; ```yaml
&gt; version: v2
&gt; name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
&gt; deps:
&gt;   - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; Always run `buf dep update` after adding a dependency to your `buf.yaml`.

See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
and generated OpenAPI output.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you need to ensure the required
dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found
by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from the
[googleapis repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), and providing
them to `protoc` when running. The files you will need are:

```
google/api/annotations.proto
google/api/field_behavior.proto
google/api/http.proto
google/api/httpbody.proto
```

Here&#039;s what a `protoc` execution might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 3. External configuration

If you do not want to (or cannot) modify the proto file for use with gRPC-Gateway you can
alternatively use an external
[gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
[Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/)
for more information. This is best combined with the `standalone=true` option
to generate a file that can live in its own package, separate from the files
generated by the source protobuf file.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml \
    --grpc-gateway_opt standalone=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 5. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;flag&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog&quot;

  gw &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/proto/gen/go/your/service/v1/your_service&quot;  // Update
)

var (
  // command-line options:
  // gRPC server endpoint
  grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String(&quot;grpc-server-endpoint&quot;,  &quot;localhost:9090&quot;, &quot;gRPC server endpoint&quot;)
)

func run() error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()

  // Register gRPC server endpoint
  // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
  mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
  opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
  err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
  return http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8081&quot;, mux)
}

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  if err := run(); err != nil {
    grpclog.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

### 6. (Optional) Generate OpenAPI definitions using `protoc-gen-openapiv2`

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
  - local: protoc-gen-openapiv2
    out: gen/go
```

To use the custom protobuf annotations supported by `protoc-gen-openapiv2`, we need
another dependency added to our protobuf generation step. If you are using
`buf`, you can add the `buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway` dependency
to your `deps` array:

```yaml
version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
  - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
```

With `protoc` (just the swagger file):

```sh
protoc -I . --openapiv2_out ./gen/openapiv2 \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you will need to copy the protobuf
files from the `protoc-gen-openapiv2/options` directory of this repository,
and providing them to `protoc` when running.

Note that this plugin also supports generating OpenAPI definitions for unannotated methods;
use the `generate_unbound_methods` option to enable this.

It is possible with the HTTP mapping for a gRPC service method to create duplicate mappings
with the only difference being constraints on the path parameter.

`/v1/{name=projects/*}` and `/v1/{name=organizations/*}` both become `/v1/{name}`. When
this occurs the plugin will rename the path parameter with a &quot;\_1&quot; (or &quot;\_2&quot; etc) suffix
to differentiate the different operations. So in the above example, the 2nd path would become
`/v1/{name_1=organizations/*}`. This can also cause OpenAPI clients to URL encode the &quot;/&quot; that is
part of the path parameter as that is what OpenAPI defines in the specification. To allow gRPC gateway to
accept the URL encoded slash and still route the request, use the UnescapingModeAllCharacters or
UnescapingModeLegacy (which is the default currently though may change in future versions). See
[Customizing Your Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/)
for more information.

## Usage with remote plugins

As an alternative to all of the above, you can use `buf` with
[remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage)
to manage plugin versions and generation. An example `buf.gen.yaml` using remote
plugin generation looks like this:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.31.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.3.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/openapiv2:v2.16.2
    out: gen/openapiv2
```

This requires no local installation of any plugins. Be careful to use the same
version of the generator as the runtime library, i.e. if using `v2.16.2`, run

```shell
$ go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2@v2.16.2
```

To get the same version of the runtime in your `go.mod`.

Note that usage of remote plugins is incompatible with usage of external configuration files like [grpc_api_configuration](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/#using-an-external-configuration-file).

## Video intro

This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro to using the gRPC-Gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base: https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Parameters and flags

When using `buf` to generate stubs, flags and parameters are passed through
the `opt` field in your `buf.gen.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

During code generation with `protoc`, flags to gRPC-Gateway tools must be passed
through `protoc` using one of 2 patterns:

- as part of the `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out` `protoc` parameter: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out=&lt;flags&gt;:&lt;path&gt;`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
--openapiv2_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
```

- using additional `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt` parameters: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt=&lt;flag&gt;[,&lt;flag&gt;]*`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
--openapiv2_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
```
