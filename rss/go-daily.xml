Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.

Harbor is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of cloud native technologies, consider joining the CNCF. For details about whose involved and how Harbor plays a role, read the CNCF
[announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/).

## Features

* **Cloud native registry**: With support for both container images and [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts, Harbor serves as registry for cloud native environments like container runtimes and orchestration platforms.
* **Role based access control**: Users access different repositories through &#039;projects&#039; and a user can have different permission for images or Helm charts under a project.
* **Policy based replication**: Images and charts can be replicated (synchronized) between multiple registry instances based on policies with using filters (repository, tag and label). Harbor automatically retries a replication if it encounters any errors. This can be used to assist loadbalancing, achieve high availability, and facilitate multi-datacenter deployments in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Harbor scans images regularly for vulnerabilities and has policy checks to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed.
* **LDAP/AD support**: Harbor integrates with existing enterprise LDAP/AD for user authentication and management, and supports importing LDAP groups into Harbor that can then be given permissions to specific projects.
* **OIDC support**: Harbor leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) to verify the identity of users authenticated by an external authorization server or identity provider. Single sign-on can be enabled to log into the Harbor portal.
* **Image deletion &amp; garbage collection**: System admin can run garbage collection jobs so that images(dangling manifests and unreferenced blobs) can be deleted and their space can be freed up periodically.
* **Notary**: Support signing container images using Docker Content Trust (leveraging Notary) for guaranteeing authenticity and provenance.  In addition, policies that prevent unsigned images from being deployed can also be activated.
* **Graphical user portal**: User can easily browse, search repositories and manage projects.
* **Auditing**: All the operations to the repositories are tracked through logs.
* **RESTful API**: RESTful APIs are provided to facilitate administrative operations, and are easy to use for integration with external systems. An embedded Swagger UI is available for exploring and testing the API.
* **Easy deployment**: Harbor can be deployed via Docker compose as well Helm Chart, and a Harbor Operator was added recently as well.

&lt;br/&gt;

**k6** is a modern load-testing tool, built on [our years of experience](https://k6.io/about) in the performance and testing industries.
It&#039;s built to be powerful, extensible, and full-featured. The key design goal is to provide **the best developer experience**.

Its core features are:

- **Configurable load generation.** Even lower-end machines can simulate lots of traffic.
- **Tests as code.** Reuse scripts, modularize logic, version control, and integrate tests with your CI.
- **A full-featured API.** The scripting API is packed with features that help you simulate real application traffic.
- **An embedded JavaScript engine.** The performance of Go, the scripting familiarity of JavaScript.
- **Multiple Protocol support**. HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, Browser, and more.
- **Large extension ecosystem.** You can extend k6 to support your needs. And many people have already shared their extensions with the community! [Explore](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/extensions/explore) the available extensions.
- **Flexible metrics storage and visualization**. Summary statistics or granular metrics, exported to the service of your choice.
- **Native integration with Grafana cloud**. [SaaS solution](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/k6/) for test execution, metrics correlation, data analysis, and more.

This is what load testing looks like in the 21st century.

## Example script


```js
import http from &quot;k6/http&quot;;
import { check, sleep } from &quot;k6&quot;;

// Test configuration
export const options = {
  thresholds: {
    // Assert that 99% of requests finish within 3000ms.
    http_req_duration: [&quot;p(99) &lt; 3000&quot;],
  },
  // Ramp the number of virtual users up and down
  stages: [
    { duration: &quot;30s&quot;, target: 15 },
    { duration: &quot;1m&quot;, target: 15 },
    { duration: &quot;20s&quot;, target: 0 },

# n.eko

Welcome to Neko, a self-hosted virtual browser that runs in Docker and uses WebRTC technology. Neko is a powerful tool that allows you to **run a fully-functional browser in a virtual environment**, giving you the ability to **access the internet securely and privately from anywhere**. With Neko, you can browse the web, **run applications**, and perform other tasks just as you would on a regular browser, all within a **secure and isolated environment**. Whether you are a developer looking to test web applications, a **privacy-conscious user seeking a secure browsing experience**, or simply someone who wants to take advantage of the **convenience and flexibility of a virtual browser**, Neko is the perfect solution.

In addition to its security and privacy features, Neko offers the **ability for multiple users to access it simultaneously**. This makes it an ideal solution for teams or organizations that need to share access to a browser, as well as for individuals who want to use **multiple devices to access the same virtual environment**. With Neko, you can **easily and securely share access to a browser with others**, without having to worry about maintaining separate configurations or settings. Whether you need to **collaborate on a project**, access shared resources, or simply want to **share access to a browser with friends or family**, Neko makes it easy to do so.

Neko is also a great tool for **hosting watch parties** and interactive presentations. With its virtual browser capabilities, Neko allows you to host watch parties and presentations that are **accessible from anywhere**, without the need for in-person gatherings. This makes it easy to **stay connected with friends and colleagues**, even when you are unable to meet in person. With Neko, you can easily host a watch party or give an **interactive presentation**, whether it&#039;s for leisure or work. Simply invite your guests to join the virtual environment, and you can share the screen and **interact with them in real-time**.

## About

This app uses WebRTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and he was able to figure out the rest.

Then I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore and it got eventually archived.

## Use-cases and comparison

Neko started as a virtual browser that is streamed using WebRTC to multiple users.
- It is **not only limited to a browser**; it can run anything that runs on linux (e.g. VLC). Browser only happens to be the most popular and widely used use-case.
- In fact, it is not limited to a single program either; you can install a full desktop environment (e.g. XFCE, KDE).
- Speaking of limits, it does not need to run in a container; you could install neko on your host, connect to your X server and control your whole VM.
- Theoretically it is not limited to only X server, anything that can be controlled and scraped periodically for images could be used instead.
  - Like implementing RDP or VNC protocol, where neko would only act as WebRTC relay server. This is currently only future.

Primary use case is connecting with multiple people, leveraging real time synchronization and interactivity:
- **Watch party** - watching video content together with multiple people and reacting to it (chat, emotes) - open source alternative to [giggl.app](https://giggl.app/) or [hyperbeam](https://watch.hyperbeam.com).
- **Interactive presentation** - not only screen sharing, but others can control the screen.
- **Collaborative tool** - brainstorming ideas, cobrowsing, code debugging together.
- **Support/Teaching** - interactively guiding people in controlled environment.
- **Embed anything** - embed virtual browser in your web app - open source alternative to [hyperbeam API](https://hyperbeam.com/).
  - open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants.
  - request rooms using API with [neko-rooms](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-rooms).

Other use cases that benefit from single-user:
- **Personal workspace** - streaming containerized apps and desktops to end-users - similar to [kasm](https://www.kasmweb.com/).
- **Persistent browser** - own browser with persistent cookies available anywhere - similar to [mightyapp](https://www.mightyapp.com/).
  - no state is left on the host browser after terminating the connection.
  - sensitive data like cookies are not transferred - only video is shared.
- **Throwaway browser** - a better solution for planning secret parties and buying birthday gifts off the internet.
  - use Tor Browser and [VPN](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-vpn) for additional anonymity.
  - mitigates risk of OS fingerprinting and browser vulnerabilities by running in container.
- **Session broadcasting** - broadcast room content using RTMP (to e.g. twitch or youtube...).
- **Session recording** - broadcast RTMP can be saved to a file using e.g. [nginx-rtmp](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/modules/rtmp-media-streaming/)
  - have clean environment when recording tutorials.
  - no need to hide bookmarks or use incognito mode.
- **Jump host** - access your internal applications securely without the need for VPN.
- **Automated browser** - you can install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and automate tasks while being able to actively intercept them.

Compared to clientless remote desktop gateway (e.g. [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) or [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) with [noVNC](https://novnc.com/)), installed with remote desktop server along with desired program (e.g. [linuxserver/firefox](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-firefox)) provides neko additionally:
- **Smooth video** because it uses WebRTC and not images sent over WebSockets.
- **Built in audio** support, what is not part of Apache Guacamole or noVNC.
- **Multi-participant control**, what is not natively supported by Apache Guacamole or noVNC.

### Why neko?

I like cats 🐱 (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I&#039;m a weeb/nerd.

***But why the cat butt?*** Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyways.

### Server SDKs

Server SDKs enable your backend to generate [access tokens](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/),
call [server APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/server/server-apis/), and
receive [webhooks](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/webhooks/). In addition, the Go SDK includes client capabilities,
enabling you to build automations that behave like end-users.

### Tools

-   [CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) - command line interface &amp; load tester
-   [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/livekit/livekit-server)
-   [Helm charts](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-helm)

## Install

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend installing [LiveKit CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) along with the server. It lets you access
&gt; server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic.

The following will install LiveKit&#039;s media server:

### MacOS

```shell
brew install livekit
```

### Linux

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io | bash
```

### Windows

Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases/latest)

## Getting Started

### Starting LiveKit

Start LiveKit in development mode by running `livekit-server --dev`. It&#039;ll use a placeholder API key/secret pair.

```
API Key: devkey
API Secret: secret
```

To customize your setup for production, refer to our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/)

### Creating access token

A user connecting to a LiveKit room requires an [access token](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/#creating-a-token). Access
tokens (JWT) encode the user&#039;s identity and the room permissions they&#039;ve been granted. You can generate a token with our
CLI:

```shell
lk token create \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --join --room my-first-room --identity user1 \
    --valid-for 24h
```

### Test with example app

Head over to our [example app](https://example.livekit.io) and enter a generated token to connect to your LiveKit
server. This app is built with our [React SDK](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-react).

Once connected, your video and audio are now being published to your new LiveKit instance!

### Simulating a test publisher

```shell
lk room join \
    --url ws://localhost:7880 \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --identity bot-user1 \
    --publish-demo \
    my-first-room
```

This command publishes a looped demo video to a room. Due to how the video clip was encoded (keyframes every 3s),
there&#039;s a slight delay before the browser has sufficient data to begin rendering frames. This is an artifact of the
simulation.

## Deployment

### Use LiveKit Cloud

LiveKit Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run LiveKit. Every project gets free monthly bandwidth and
transcoding credits.

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

### Self-host

Read our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/) for more information.

## Building from source

Pre-requisites:

-   Go 1.23+ is installed
-   GOPATH/bin is in your PATH

Then run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/livekit/livekit
cd livekit
./bootstrap.sh
mage
```

## Goals

We are building the **System Level Intelligence** for Mixture-of-Models (MoM), bringing the **Collective Intelligence** into **LLM systems**, answering the following questions:

1. How to capture the missing signals in request, response and context?
2. How to combine the signals to make better decisions?
3. How to collaborate more efficiently between different models?
4. How to secure the real world and LLM system from jailbreaks, pii leaks, hallucinations?
5. How to collect the valuable signals and build a self-learning system?

The toolset to pack, ship, store, and deliver content.

This repository&#039;s main product is the Open Source Registry implementation
for storing and distributing container images and other content using the
[OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec).
The goal of this project is to provide a simple, secure, and scalable base
for building a large scale registry solution or running a simple private registry.
It is a core library for many registry operators including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry,
GitLab Container Registry and DigitalOcean Container Registry, as well as the CNCF Harbor
Project, and VMware Harbor Registry.

This repository contains the following components:

|**Component**       |Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **registry**       | An implementation of the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec).                                                                                                 |
| **libraries**      | A rich set of libraries for interacting with distribution components. Please see [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/distribution/distribution) for details. **Note**: The interfaces for these libraries are **unstable**. |
| **documentation**  | Full documentation is available at [https://distribution.github.io/distribution](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/).

### How does this integrate with Docker, containerd, and other OCI client?

Clients implement against the OCI specification and communicate with the
registry using HTTP. This project contains a client implementation which
is currently in use by Docker, however, it is deprecated for the
[implementation in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/master/remotes/docker)
and will not support new features.

### What are the long term goals of the Distribution project?

The _Distribution_ project has the further long term goal of providing a
secure tool chain for distributing content. The specifications, APIs and tools
should be as useful with Docker as they are without.

Our goal is to design a professional grade and extensible content distribution
system that allow users to:

* Enjoy an efficient, secured and reliable way to store, manage, package and
  exchange content
* Hack/roll their own on top of healthy open-source components
* Implement their own home made solution through good specs, and solid
  extensions mechanism.

## Contribution

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute
issues, fixes, and patches to this project. If you are contributing code, see
the instructions for [building a development environment](BUILDING.md).

## Communication

For async communication and long running discussions please use issues and pull requests on the github repo.
This will be the best place to discuss design and implementation.

For sync communication we have a #distribution channel in the [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/)
that everyone is welcome to join and chat about development.

## Crawling Mode

### Standard Mode

Standard crawling modality uses the standard go http library under the hood to handle HTTP requests/responses. This modality is much faster as it doesn&#039;t have the browser overhead. Still, it analyzes HTTP responses body as is, without any javascript or DOM rendering, potentially missing post-dom-rendered endpoints or asynchronous endpoint calls that might happen in complex web applications depending, for example, on browser-specific events.

### Headless Mode

Headless mode hooks internal headless calls to handle HTTP requests/responses directly within the browser context. This offers two advantages:
- The HTTP fingerprint (TLS and user agent) fully identify the client as a legitimate browser
- Better coverage since the endpoints are discovered analyzing the standard raw response, as in the previous modality, and also the browser-rendered one with javascript enabled.

Headless crawling is optional and can be enabled using `-headless` option.

Here are other headless CLI options -

```console
katana -h headless

Flags:
HEADLESS:
   -hl, -headless                    enable headless hybrid crawling (experimental)
   -sc, -system-chrome               use local installed chrome browser instead of katana installed
   -sb, -show-browser                show the browser on the screen with headless mode
   -ho, -headless-options string[]   start headless chrome with additional options
   -nos, -no-sandbox                 start headless chrome in --no-sandbox mode
   -cdd, -chrome-data-dir string     path to store chrome browser data
   -scp, -system-chrome-path string  use specified chrome browser for headless crawling
   -noi, -no-incognito               start headless chrome without incognito mode
   -cwu, -chrome-ws-url string       use chrome browser instance launched elsewhere with the debugger listening at this URL
   -xhr, -xhr-extraction             extract xhr requests
```

*`-no-sandbox`*
----

Runs headless chrome browser with **no-sandbox** option, useful when running as root user.

```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -headless -no-sandbox
```

*`-no-incognito`*
----

Runs headless chrome browser without incognito mode, useful when using the local browser.

```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -headless -no-incognito
```

*`-headless-options`*
----

When crawling in headless mode, additional chrome options can be specified using `-headless-options`, for example -


```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -headless -system-chrome -headless-options --disable-gpu,proxy-server=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```


## Scope Control

Crawling can be endless if not scoped, as such katana comes with multiple support to define the crawl scope.

*`-field-scope`*
----
Most handy option to define scope with predefined field name, `rdn` being default option for field scope.

   - `rdn` - crawling scoped to root domain name and all subdomains (e.g. `*example.com`) (default)
   - `fqdn` - crawling scoped to given sub(domain) (e.g. `www.example.com` or `api.example.com`)
   - `dn` - crawling scoped to domain name keyword (e.g. `example`)

```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -fs dn
```


*`-crawl-scope`*
------

For advanced scope control, `-cs` option can be used that comes with **regex** support.

```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -cs login
```

For multiple in scope rules, file input with multiline string / regex can be passed.

```bash
$ cat in_scope.txt

login/
admin/
app/
wordpress/
```

```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -cs in_scope.txt
```


*`-crawl-out-scope`*
-----

For defining what not to crawl, `-cos` option can be used and also support **regex** input.

```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -cos logout
```

For multiple out of scope rules, file input with multiline string / regex can be passed.

```bash
$ cat out_of_scope.txt

/logout
/log_out
```

```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -cos out_of_scope.txt
```

*`-no-scope`*
----

Katana is default to scope `*.domain`, to disable this `-ns` option can be used and also to crawl the internet.

```console
katana -u https://tesla.com -ns
```

*`-display-out-scope`*
----

As default, when scope option is used, it also applies for the links to display as output, as such **external URLs are default to exclude** and to overwrite this behavior, `-do` option can be used to display all the external URLs that exist in targets scoped URL / Endpoint.

```
katana -u https://tesla.com -do
```

Here is all the CLI options for the scope control -


```console
katana -h scope

Flags:
SCOPE:
   -cs, -crawl-scope string[]       in scope url regex to be followed by crawler
   -cos, -crawl-out-scope string[]  out of scope url regex to be excluded by crawler
   -fs, -field-scope string         pre-defined scope field (dn,rdn,fqdn) (default &quot;rdn&quot;)
   -ns, -no-scope                   disables host based default scope
   -do, -display-out-scope          display external endpoint from scoped crawling
```


## Crawler Configuration

Katana comes with multiple options to configure and control the crawl as the way we want.

*`-depth`*
----

Option to define the `depth` to follow the urls for crawling, the more depth the more number of endpoint being crawled + time for crawl.

```
katana -u https://tesla.com -d 5
```

*`-js-crawl`*
----

Option to enable JavaScript file parsing + crawling the endpoints discovered in JavaScript files, disabled as default.

```
katana -u https://tesla.com -jc
```

*`-crawl-duration`*
----

Option to predefined crawl duration, disabled as default.

```
katana -u https://tesla.com -ct 2
```

*`-known-files`*
----
Option to enable crawling `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` file, disabled as default.

```
katana -u https://tesla.com -kf robotstxt,sitemapxml
```

*`-automatic-form-fill`*
----

Option to enable automatic form filling for known / unknown fields, known field values can be customized as needed by updating form config file at `$HOME/.config/katana/form-config.yaml`.

Automatic form filling is experimental feature.

```
katana -u https://tesla.com -aff
```

## Authenticated Crawling

Authenticated crawling involves including custom headers or cookies in HTTP requests to access protected resources. These headers provide authentication or authorization information, allowing you to crawl authenticated content / endpoint. You can specify headers directly in the command line or provide them as a file with katana to perform authenticated crawling.

&gt; **Note**: User needs to be manually perform the authentication and export the session cookie / header to file to use with katana.

*`-headers`*
----

Option to add a custom header or cookie to the request.

## Elevator Pitch

Minor rant incoming: Something&#039;s not working? Maybe a service is down. `docker-compose ps`. Yep, it&#039;s that microservice that&#039;s still buggy. No issue, I&#039;ll just restart it: `docker-compose restart`. Okay now let&#039;s try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. `docker-compose ps`. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with `docker compose logs --follow myservice` but that dies everytime the service dies so I&#039;d need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run `docker-compose up myservice` and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just `up` it again, but now I&#039;ve got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do `ctrl+P,Q`, but... wait, that&#039;s not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can&#039;t remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service.

What a headache!

Memorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible. What if you had all the information you needed in one terminal window with every common command living one keypress away (and the ability to add custom commands as well). Lazydocker&#039;s goal is to make that dream a reality.

## Requirements

- Docker &gt;= **29.0.0** (API &gt;= **1.24**)
- Docker-Compose &gt;= **1.23.2** (optional)

## Installation

### Homebrew

Normally `lazydocker` formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you to tap our formula to get frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too.

**Tap**:
```sh
brew install jesseduffield/lazydocker/lazydocker
```

**Core**:
```sh
brew install lazydocker
```

### Scoop (Windows)

You can install `lazydocker` using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```sh
scoop install lazydocker
```
### Chocolatey (Windows)

You can install `lazydocker` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```sh
choco install lazydocker
```
### asdf-vm

You can install [asdf-lazydocker plugin](https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker) using [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/):
#### Setup (Once)
```sh
asdf plugin add lazydocker https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker.git
```

#### For Install / Upgrade
```sh
asdf list all lazydocker
asdf install lazydocker latest
asdf global lazydocker latest
```

### Binary Release (Linux/OSX/Windows)

You can manually download a binary release from [the release page](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/releases).

Automated install/update, don&#039;t forget to always verify what you&#039;re piping into bash:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/master/scripts/install_update_linux.sh | bash
```
The script installs downloaded binary to `$HOME/.local/bin` directory by default, but it can be changed by setting `DIR` environment variable.

### Go

Required Go Version &gt;= **1.19**

```sh
go install github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker@latest
```

Required Go version &gt;= **1.8**, &lt;= **1.17**

```sh
go get github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker
```

### Arch Linux AUR

You can install lazydocker using the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazydocker) by running:

```sh
yay -S lazydocker
```

### Docker

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/lazyteam/lazydocker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyteam/lazydocker)
[![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/lazyteam/lazydocker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyteam/lazydocker)

1. &lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Click if you have an ARM device&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    - If you have a ARM 32 bit v6 architecture

        ```sh
        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm32v6/golang \
        --build-arg GOARCH=arm \
        --build-arg GOARM=6 \
        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
        ```

    - If you have a ARM 32 bit v7 architecture

        ```sh
        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm32v7/golang \
        --build-arg GOARCH=arm \
        --build-arg GOARM=7 \
        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
        ```

    - If you have a ARM 64 bit v8 architecture

        ```sh
        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm64v8/golang \
        --build-arg GOARCH=arm64 \
        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
        ```

    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

1. Run the container

    ```sh
    docker run --rm -it -v \
    /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /yourpath:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker \
    lazyteam/lazydocker
    ```

    - Don&#039;t forget to change `/yourpath` to an actual path you created to store lazydocker&#039;s config
    - You can also use this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
    - You might want to create an alias, for example:

        ```sh
        echo &quot;alias lzd=&#039;docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /yourpath/config:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker lazyteam/lazydocker&#039;&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
        ```



For development, you can build the image using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
cd lazydocker
docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
    --build-arg BUILD_DATE=`date -u +&quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ&quot;` \
    --build-arg VCS_REF=`git rev-parse --short HEAD` \
    --build-arg VERSION=`git describe --abbrev=0 --tag` \
    .
```

If you encounter a compatibility issue with Docker bundled binary, try rebuilding
the image with the build argument `--build-arg DOCKER_VERSION=&quot;v$(docker -v | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev)&quot;`
so that the bundled docker binary matches your host docker binary version.

### Manual

You&#039;ll need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

```
git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
cd lazydocker
go install
```

You can also use `go run main.go` to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)

## Usage

Call `lazydocker` in your terminal. I personally use this a lot so I&#039;ve made an alias for it like so:

```
echo &quot;alias lzd=&#039;lazydocker&#039;&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

(you can substitute .zshrc for whatever rc file you&#039;re using)

- List of keybindings
  [here](/docs/keybindings).

## Cool features

everything is one keypress away (or one click away! Mouse support FTW):

- viewing the state of your docker or docker-compose container environment at a glance
- viewing logs for a container/service
- viewing ascii graphs of your containers&#039; metrics so that you can not only feel but also look like a developer
- customising

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

![Crossplane](banner.png)

Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
needing to write code. It has a highly extensible backend that enables you to
build a control plane that can orchestrate applications and infrastructure no
matter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend that puts you in
control of the schema of the declarative API it offers.

Crossplane is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][cncf] project.

## Get Started

Crossplane&#039;s [Get Started Docs] covers install and resource quickstarts.

## Roadmap

The public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues
added to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the
community, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.

The maintainer team regularly triages requests from the community to identify
features and issues of suitable scope and impact to include in this roadmap. The
community is encouraged to show their support for potential roadmap issues by
adding a :+1: reaction, leaving descriptive comments, and attending the
[regular community meetings] to discuss their requirements and use cases.

The maintainer team updates the roadmap on an as needed basis, in response to
demand, priority, and available resources. The public roadmap can be updated at
any time.

Milestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of
overall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered
approximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific
delivery timeline.

Dapr is a set of integrated APIs with built-in best practices and patterns to build distributed applications. Dapr increases your developer productivity by 20-40% with out-of-the-box features such as workflow, pub/sub, state management, secret stores, external configuration, bindings, actors, distributed lock, and cryptography. You benefit from the built-in security, reliability, and observability capabilities, so you don&#039;t need to write boilerplate code to achieve production-ready applications.

With Dapr, a graduated CNCF project, platform teams can configure complex setups while exposing simple interfaces to application development teams, making it easier for them to build highly scalable distributed applications. Many platform teams have adopted Dapr to provide governance and golden paths for API-based infrastructure interaction.

![Dapr overview](./img/overview.png)

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kedacore/keda/main/images/logo-cncf.svg&quot; height=&quot;75px&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

## Goals

- Enable developers using *any* language or framework to write distributed applications
- Solve the hard problems developers face building microservice applications by providing best practice building blocks
- Be community driven, open and vendor neutral
- Gain new contributors
- Provide consistency and portability through open APIs
- Be platform agnostic across cloud and edge
- Embrace extensibility and provide pluggable components without vendor lock-in
- Enable IoT and edge scenarios by being highly performant and lightweight
- Be incrementally adoptable from existing code, with no runtime dependency

## How it works

Dapr injects a side-car (container or process) to each compute unit. The side-car interacts with event triggers and communicates with the compute unit via standard HTTP or gRPC protocols. This enables Dapr to support all existing and future programming languages without requiring you to import frameworks or libraries.

Dapr offers built-in state management, reliable messaging (at least once delivery), triggers and bindings through standard HTTP verbs or gRPC interfaces. This allows you to write stateless, stateful and actor-like services following the same programming paradigm. You can freely choose consistency model, threading model and message delivery patterns.

Dapr runs natively on Kubernetes, as a self hosted binary on your machine, on an IoT device, or as a container that can be injected into any system, in the cloud or on-premises.

Dapr uses pluggable component state stores and message buses such as Redis as well as gRPC to offer a wide range of communication methods, including direct dapr-to-dapr using gRPC and async Pub-Sub with guaranteed delivery and at-least-once semantics.


## Why Dapr?

Writing highly performant, scalable and reliable distributed application is hard. Dapr brings proven patterns and practices to you. It unifies event-driven and actors semantics into a simple, consistent programming model. It supports all programming languages without framework lock-in. You are not exposed to low-level primitives such as threading, concurrency control, partitioning and scaling. Instead, you can write your code by implementing a simple web server using familiar web frameworks of your choice.

Dapr is flexible in threading and state consistency models. You can leverage multi-threading if you choose to, and you can choose among different consistency models. This flexibility enables you to implement advanced scenarios without artificial constraints. Dapr is unique because you can transition seamlessly between platforms and underlying implementations without rewriting your code.

# &lt;img src=&quot;https://opentelemetry.io/img/logos/opentelemetry-logo-nav.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenTelemetry Icon&quot; width=&quot;45&quot; height=&quot;&quot;&gt; OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to
receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need
to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support
open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to
multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

Objectives:

- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.
- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.
- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.
- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.
- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.

## Community

The OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)
channel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via
video calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:

- meet the humans behind the project
- get an opinion about specific proposals
- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack
- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously

We rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to
allow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:

Tuesday:

- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)

Wednesday:

- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)
- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)

Contributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.
Post a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong
reasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to
identify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.

Remember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the
relevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull
request where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous
calls and don&#039;t want them to feel excluded.

## Supported OTLP version

This code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,
considered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability
definition
here.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)

## Stability levels

See [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.

## Compatibility

When used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.

Support for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:

1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.
2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.

Official OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.

## Verifying the images signatures

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.

We are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:

```console
$ cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt; \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  &lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;
```

where:

- `&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt;`: is the release that you want to validate
- `&lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;`: is the image that you want to check

Example:

```console
$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0

Verification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates

# Karpenter

Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by:

* **Watching** for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable
* **Evaluating** scheduling constraints (resource requests, nodeselectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints) requested by the pods
* **Provisioning** nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
* **Removing** the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed

fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-preview.png&quot; width=640&gt;

It&#039;s an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command
history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. It implements
a &quot;fuzzy&quot; matching algorithm, so you can quickly type in patterns with omitted
characters and still get the results you want.

Highlights
----------

- **Portable** — Distributed as a single binary for easy installation
- **Fast** — Optimized to process millions of items instantly
- **Versatile** — Fully customizable through an event-action binding mechanism
- **All-inclusive** — Comes with integrations for Bash, Zsh, Fish, Vim, and Neovim

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/fzf.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/fzf/versions)

### Windows packages

On Windows, fzf is available via [Chocolatey][choco], [Scoop][scoop],
[Winget][winget], and [MSYS2][msys2]:

| Package manager | Command                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Chocolatey      | `choco install fzf`                   |
| Scoop           | `scoop install fzf`                   |
| Winget          | `winget install fzf`                  |
| MSYS2 (pacman)  | `pacman -S $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-fzf` |

[choco]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/fzf
[scoop]: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/master/bucket/fzf.json
[winget]: https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/j/junegunn/fzf
[msys2]: https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-fzf

### Using git

Alternatively, you can &quot;git clone&quot; this repository to any directory and run
[install](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/install) script.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
```

The install script will add lines to your shell configuration file to modify
`$PATH` and set up shell integration.

### Binary releases

You can download the official fzf binaries from the releases page.

* https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases

### Setting up shell integration

Add the following line to your shell configuration file.

* bash
  ```sh
  # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
  eval &quot;$(fzf --bash)&quot;
  ```
* zsh
  ```sh
  # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
  source &lt;(fzf --zsh)
  ```
* fish
  ```fish
  # Set up fzf key bindings
  fzf --fish | source
  ```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; `--bash`, `--zsh`, and `--fish` options are only available in fzf 0.48.0 or
&gt; later. If you have an older version of fzf, or want finer control, you can
&gt; source individual script files in the [/shell](/shell) directory. The
&gt; location of the files may vary depending on the package manager you use.
&gt; Please refer to the package documentation for more information.
&gt; (e.g. `apt show fzf`)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can disable CTRL-T, CTRL-R, or ALT-C bindings by setting the
&gt; corresponding `*_COMMAND` variable to an empty string when sourcing the
&gt; script. For example, to disable CTRL-R and ALT-C:
&gt;
&gt; * bash: `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval &quot;$(fzf --bash)&quot;`
&gt; * zsh: `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source &lt;(fzf --zsh)`
&gt; * fish: `fzf --fish | FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source`
&gt;
&gt; Setting the variables after sourcing the script will have no effect.

### Vim/Neovim plugin

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this to
your Vim configuration file:

```vim
Plug &#039;junegunn/fzf&#039;, { &#039;do&#039;: { -&gt; fzf#install() } }
Plug &#039;junegunn/fzf.vim&#039;
```

* `junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions
    * `fzf#install()` makes sure that you have the latest binary
* `junegunn/fzf.vim` is [a separate project](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
  that provides a variety of useful commands

To learn more about the Vim integration, see [README-VIM.md](README-VIM.md).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out
&gt; [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua).

Upgrading fzf
-------------

fzf is being actively developed, and you might want to upgrade it once in a
while. Please follow the instruction below depending on the installation
method used.

- git: `cd ~/.fzf &amp;&amp; git pull &amp;&amp; ./install`
- brew: `brew update; brew upgrade fzf`
- macports: `sudo port upgrade fzf`
- chocolatey: `choco upgrade fzf`
- vim-plug: `:PlugUpdate fzf`

Building fzf
------------

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

Usage
-----

fzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the
selected item to STDOUT.

```sh
find * -type f | fzf &gt; selected
```

Without STDIN pipe, fzf will traverse the file system under the current
directory to get the list of files.

```sh
vim $(fzf)
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You can override the default behavior
&gt; * Either by setting `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to a command that generates the desired list
&gt; * Or by setting `--walker`, `--walker-root`, and `--walker-skip` options in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we&#039;ve presented
&gt; the above as it&#039;s easier to grasp
&gt; ```sh
&gt; fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim
&gt; ```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process.
&gt;
&gt; ```sh
&gt; fzf --bind &#039;enter:become(vim {})&#039;
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; *See [Turning into a different process](#turning-into-a-different-process)
&gt; for more information.*

### Using the finder

- `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down
- `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit
- On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items
- Emacs style key bindings
- Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on
  multi-select mode

### Display modes

fzf by default runs in fullscreen mode, but there are other display modes.

#### `--height` mode

With `--height HEIGHT[%]`, fzf will start below the cursor with the given height.

```sh
fzf --height 40%
```

`reverse` layout and `--border` goes well with this option.

```sh
fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border
```

By prepending `~` to the height, you&#039;re setting the maximum height.

```sh
# Will take as few lines as possible to display the list
seq 3 | fzf --height ~100%
seq 3000 | fzf --height ~100%
```

Height value can be a negative number.

```sh
# Screen height - 3
fzf --height -3
```

#### `--tmux` mode

With `--tmux` option, fzf will start in a tmux popup.

```sh
# --tmux [center|top|bottom|left|right][,SIZE[%]][,SIZE[%][,border-native]]

fzf --tmux center         # Center, 50% width and height
fzf --tmux 80%            # Center, 80% width and height
fzf --tmux 100%,50%       # Center, 100% width and 50% height
fzf --tmux left,40%       # Left, 40% width
fzf --tmux left,40%,90%   # Left, 40% width, 90% height
fzf --tmux top,40%        # Top, 40% height
fzf --tmux bottom,80%,40% # Bottom, 80% width, 40% height
```

`--tmux` is silently ignored when you&#039;re not on tmux.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re stuck with an old version of tmux that doesn&#039;t support popup,
&gt; or if you want to open fzf in a regular tmux pane, check out
&gt; [fzf-tmux](bin/fzf-tmux) script.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can add these options to `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` so that they&#039;re applied by
&gt; default. For example,
&gt;
&gt; ```sh
&gt; # Open in tmux popup if on tmux, otherwise use --height mode
&gt; export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&#039;--height 40% --tmux bottom,40% --layout reverse --border top&#039;
&gt; ```

### Search syntax

Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in &quot;extended-search mode&quot; where you can
type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. `^music .mp3$ sbtrkt
!fire`

| Token     | Match type                              | Description                                  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------  | ------------------------------------------   |
| `sbtrkt`  | fuzzy-match                             | Items that match `sbtrkt`                    |
| `&#039;wild`   | exact-match (quoted)                    | Items that include `wild`                    |
| `&#039;wild&#039;`  | exact-boundary-match (quoted both ends) | Items that include `wild` at word boundaries |
| `^music`  | prefix-exact-match                      | Items that start with `music`                |
| `.mp3$`   | suffix-exact-match                      | Items that end with `.mp3`                   |
| `!fire`   | inverse-exact-match                     | Items that do not include `fire`             |
| `!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match              | Items that do not start with `music`         |
| `!.mp3$`  | inverse-suffix-exact-match              | Items that do not end with `.mp3`            |

If you don&#039;t prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to &quot;quote&quot; every word,
start fzf with `-e` or `--exact` option. Note that when  `--exact` is set,
`&#039;`-prefix &quot;unquotes&quot; the term.

A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following
query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either `go`, `rb`,
or `py`.

```
^core go$ | rb$ | py$
```

### Environment variables

- `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`
    - Default command to use when input is tty
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=&#039;fd --type f&#039;`
- `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`
    - Default options
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&quot;--layout=reverse --inline-info&quot;`
- `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE`
    - If you prefer to manage default options in a file, set this variable to
      point to the location of the file
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE=~/.fzfrc`

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is not used by shell integration due to the
&gt; slight difference in requirements.
&gt;
&gt; * `CTRL-T` runs `$FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to get a list of files and directories
&gt; * `ALT-C` runs `$FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to get a list of directories
&gt; * `vim ~/**&lt;tab&gt;` runs `fzf_compgen_path()` with the prefix (`~/`) as the first argument
&gt; * `cd foo**&lt;tab&gt;` runs `fzf_compgen_dir()` with the prefix (`foo`) as the first argument
&gt;
&gt; The available options are described later in this document.

### Customizing the look

The user interface of fzf is fully customizable with a large number of
configuration options. For a quick setup, you can start with one of the style
presets — `default`, `full`, or `minimal` — using the `--style` option.

```sh
fzf --style full \
    --preview &#039;fzf-preview.sh {}&#039; --bind &#039;focus:transform-header:file --brief {}&#039;
```

| Preset    | Screenshot                                                                             |
| :---      | :---                                                                                   |
| `default` | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-default.png&quot;/&gt; |
| `full`    | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-full.png&quot;/&gt;    |
| `minimal` | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-minimal.png&quot;/&gt; |

Here&#039;s an example based on the `full` preset:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-4-borders.png&quot;/&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

```sh
git ls-files | fzf --style full \
    --border --padding 1,2 \
    --border-label &#039; Demo &#039; --input-label &#039; Input &#039; --header-label &#039; File Type &#039; \
    --preview &#039;fzf-preview.sh {}&#039; \
    --bind &#039;result:transform-list-label:
        if [[ -z $FZF_QUERY ]]; then
          echo &quot; $FZF_MATCH_COUNT items &quot;
        else
          echo &quot; $FZF_MATCH_COUNT matches for [$FZF_QUERY] &quot;
        fi
        &#039; \
    --bind &#039;focus:transform-preview-label:[[ -n {} ]] &amp;&amp; printf &quot; Previewing [%s] &quot; {}&#039; \
    --bind &#039;focus:+transform-header:file --brief {} || echo &quot;No file selected&quot;&#039; \
    --bind &#039;ctrl-r:change-list-label( Reloading the list )+reload(sleep 2; git ls-files)&#039; \
    --color &#039;border:#aaaaaa,label:#cccccc&#039; \
    --color &#039;preview-border:#9999cc,preview-label:#ccccff&#039; \
    --color &#039;list-border:#669966,list-label:#99cc99&#039; \
    --color &#039;input-border:#996666,input-label:#ffcccc&#039; \
    --color &#039;header-border:#6699cc,header-label:#99ccff&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

Key bindings for command-line
-----------------------------

By [setting up shell integration](#setting-up-shell-integration), you can use
the following key bindings in bash, zsh, and fish.

- `CTRL-T` - Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line
    - The list is generated using `--walker file,dir,follow,hidden` option
        - You can override the behavior by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to a custom command that generates the desired list
        - Or you can set `--walker*` options in `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS`
    - Set `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf
      ```sh
      # Preview file content using bat (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
      export FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS=&quot;
        --walker-skip .g

## ✨ Features &lt;a id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A powerful and flexible Kubernetes [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://blog.marcnuri.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-introduction) server implementation with support for **Kubernetes** and **OpenShift**.

- **✅ Configuration**:
  - Automatically detect changes in the Kubernetes configuration and update the MCP server.
  - **View** and manage the current [Kubernetes `.kube/config`](https://blog.marcnuri.com/where-is-my-default-kubeconfig-file) or in-cluster configuration.
- **✅ Generic Kubernetes Resources**: Perform operations on **any** Kubernetes or OpenShift resource.
  - Any CRUD operation (Create or Update, Get, List, Delete).
- **✅ Pods**: Perform Pod-specific operations.
  - **List** pods in all namespaces or in a specific namespace.
  - **Get** a pod by name from the specified namespace.
  - **Delete** a pod by name from the specified namespace.
  - **Show logs** for a pod by name from the specified namespace.
  - **Top** gets resource usage metrics for all pods or a specific pod in the specified namespace.
  - **Exec** into a pod and run a command.
  - **Run** a container image in a pod and optionally expose it.
- **✅ Namespaces**: List Kubernetes Namespaces.
- **✅ Events**: View Kubernetes events in all namespaces or in a specific namespace.
- **✅ Projects**: List OpenShift Projects.
- **☸️ Helm**:
  - **Install** a Helm chart in the current or provided namespace.
  - **List** Helm releases in all namespaces or in a specific namespace.
  - **Uninstall** a Helm release in the current or provided namespace.

Unlike other Kubernetes MCP server implementations, this **IS NOT** just a wrapper around `kubectl` or `helm` command-line tools.
It is a **Go-based native implementation** that interacts directly with the Kubernetes API server.

There is **NO NEED** for external dependencies or tools to be installed on the system.
If you&#039;re using the native binaries you don&#039;t need to have Node or Python installed on your system.

- **✅ Lightweight**: The server is distributed as a single native binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **✅ High-Performance / Low-Latency**: Directly interacts with the Kubernetes API server without the overhead of calling and waiting for external commands.
- **✅ Multi-Cluster**: Can interact with multiple Kubernetes clusters simultaneously (as defined in your kubeconfig files).
- **✅ Cross-Platform**: Available as a native binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows, as well as an npm package, a Python package, and container/Docker image.
- **✅ Configurable**: Supports [command-line arguments](#configuration)  to configure the server behavior.
- **✅ Well tested**: The server has an extensive test suite to ensure its reliability and correctness across different Kubernetes environments.

## 🚀 Getting Started &lt;a id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Requirements

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Claude Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Follow the [dedicated Claude Code getting started guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED_CLAUDE_CODE.md) in our [user documentation](docs/).

For a secure production setup with dedicated ServiceAccount and read-only access, also review the [Kubernetes setup guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED_KUBERNETES.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

### Claude Desktop

#### Using npx

If you have npm installed, this is the fastest way to get started with `kubernetes-mcp-server` on Claude Desktop.

Open your `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the mcp server to the list of `mcpServers`:
``` json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;kubernetes&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;kubernetes-mcp-server@latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code / VS Code Insiders

Install the Kubernetes MCP server extension in VS Code Insiders by pressing the following link:

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&amp;label=Install%20Server&amp;color=0098FF&quot; alt=&quot;Install in VS Code&quot;&gt;](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522kubernetes%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522-y%2522%252C%2522kubernetes-mcp-server%2540latest%2522%255D%257D)
[&lt;img alt=&quot;Install in VS Code Insiders&quot; src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&amp;label=Install%20Server&amp;color=24bfa5&quot;&gt;](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode-insiders%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522kubernetes%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522-y%2522%252C%2522kubernetes-mcp-server%2540latest%2522%255D%257D)

Alternatively, you can install the extension manually by running the following command:

```shell
# For VS Code
code --add-mcp &#039;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;kubernetes&quot;,&quot;command&quot;:&quot;npx&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:[&quot;kubernetes-mcp-server@latest&quot;]}&#039;
# For VS Code Insiders
code-insiders --add-mcp &#039;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;kubernetes&quot;,&quot;command&quot;:&quot;npx&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:[&quot;kubernetes-mcp-server@latest&quot;]}&#039;
```

### Cursor

Install the Kubernetes MCP server extension in Cursor by pressing the following link:

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=kubernetes-mcp-server&amp;config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IGt1YmVybmV0ZXMtbWNwLXNlcnZlckBsYXRlc3QifQ%3D%3D)

Alternatively, you can install the extension manually by editing the `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;kubernetes-mcp-server&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;kubernetes-mcp-server@latest&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Goose CLI

[Goose CLI](https://blog.marcnuri.com/goose-on-machine-ai-agent-cli-introduction) is the easiest (and cheapest) way to get rolling with artificial intelligence (AI) agents.

#### Using npm

If you have npm installed, this is the fastest way to get started with `kubernetes-mcp-server`.

Open your goose `config.yaml` and add the mcp server to the list of `mcpServers`:
```yaml
extensions:
  kubernetes:
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - kubernetes-mcp-server@latest

```

# Run the Kubernetes MCP server using uvx (in case you have uv and python installed)
uvx kubernetes-mcp-server@latest --help
```

```shell
# Run the Kubernetes MCP server using the latest release binary
./kubernetes-mcp-server --help
```

### Configuration Options

| Option                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--port`                  | Starts the MCP server in Streamable HTTP mode (path /mcp) and Server-Sent Event (SSE) (path /sse) mode and listens on the specified port .                                                                                                                                                    |
| `--log-level`             | Sets the logging level (values [from 0-9](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-instrumentation/logging.md)). Similar to [kubectl logging levels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/#kubectl-output-verbosity-and-debugging). |
| `--config`                | (Optional) Path to the main TOML configuration file. See [Drop-in Configuration](#drop-in-configuration) section below for details.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `--config-dir`            | (Optional) Path to drop-in configuration directory. Files are loaded in lexical (alphabetical) order. Defaults to `conf.d` relative to the main config file if `--config` is specified. See [Drop-in Configuration](#drop-in-configuration) section below for details.                       |
| `--kubeconfig`            | Path to the Kubernetes configuration file. If not provided, it will try to resolve the configuration (in-cluster, default location, etc.).                                                                                                                                                    |
| `--list-output`           | Output format for resource list operations (one of: yaml, table) (default &quot;table&quot;)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `--read-only`             | If set, the MCP server will run in read-only mode, meaning it will not allow any write operations (create, update, delete) on the Kubernetes cluster. This is useful for debugging or inspecting the cluster without making changes.                                                          |
| `--disable-destructive`   | If set, the MCP server will disable all destructive operations (delete, update, etc.) on the Kubernetes cluster. This is useful for debugging or inspecting the cluster without accidentally making changes. This option has no effect when `--read-only` is used.                            |
| `--stateless`             | If set, the MCP server will run in stateless mode, disabling tool and prompt change notifications. This is useful for container deployments, load balancing, and serverless environments where maintaining client state is not desired. |
| `--toolsets`              | Comma-separated list of toolsets to enable. Check the [🛠️ Tools and Functionalities](#tools-and-functionalities) section for more information.                                                                                                                                               |
| `--disable-multi-cluster` | If set, the MCP server will disable multi-cluster support and will only use the current context from the kubeconfig file. This is useful if you want to restrict the MCP server to a single cluster.                                                                                          |

### Drop-in Configuration &lt;a id=&quot;drop-in-configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Kubernetes MCP server supports flexible configuration through both a main config file and drop-in files. **Both are optional** - you can use either, both, or neither (server will use built-in defaults).

#### Configuration Loading Order

Configuration values are loaded and merged in the following order (later sources override earlier ones):

1. **Internal Defaults** - Always loaded (hardcoded default values)
2. **Main Configuration File** - Optional, loaded via `--config` flag
3. **Drop-in Files** - Optional, loaded from `--config-dir` in **lexical (alphabetical) order**

#### How Drop-in Files Work

- **Default Directory**: If `--config-dir` is not specified, the server looks for drop-in files in `conf.d/` relative to the main config file&#039;s directory (when `--config` is provided)
- **File Naming**: Use numeric prefixes to control loading order (e.g., `00-base.toml`, `10-cluster.toml`, `99-override.toml`)
- **File Extension**: Only `.toml` files are processed; dotfiles (starting with `.`) are ignored
- **Partial Configuration**: Drop-in files can contain only a subset of configuration options
- **Merge Behavior**: Values present in a drop-in file override previous values; missing values are preserved

#### Dynamic Configuration Reload

To reload configuration after modifying config files, send a `SIGHUP` signal to the running server process.

**Prerequisite**: SIGHUP reload requires the server to be started with either the `--config` flag or `--config-dir` flag (or both). If neither is specified, SIGHUP signals will be ignored.

**How to reload:**

```shell
# Find the process ID
ps aux | grep kubernetes-mcp-server

# Send SIGHUP to reload configuration
kill -HUP &lt;pid&gt;

# Or use pkill
pkill -HUP kubernetes-mcp-server
```

The server will:
- Reload the main config file and all drop-in files
- Update configuration values (log level, output format, etc.)
- Rebuild the toolset registry with new tool configurations
- Log the reload status

**Note**: Changing `kubeconfig` or cluster-related settings requires a server restart. Only tool configurations, log levels, and output formats can be reloaded dynamically.

**Note**: SIGHUP reload is not available on Windows. On Windows, restart the server to reload configuration.

#### Example: Using Both Config Methods

**Command (using default `conf.d` directory):**
```shell
kubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml
```

**Directory structure:**
```
/etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/
├── config.toml              # Main configuration
└── conf.d/                  # Default drop-in directory (automatically loaded)
    ├── 00-base.toml         # Base overrides
    ├── 10-toolsets.toml     # Toolset-specific config
    └── 99-local.toml        # Local overrides
```

**Command (with explicit `--config-dir`):**
```shell
kubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml \
                      --config-dir /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.d/
```

**Example drop-in file** (`10-toolsets.toml`):
```toml
# Override only the toolsets - all other config preserved
toolsets = [&quot;core&quot;, &quot;config&quot;, &quot;helm&quot;, &quot;logs&quot;]
```

**Example drop-in file** (`99-local.toml`):
```toml
# Local development overrides
log_level = 9
read_only = true
```

**To apply changes:**
```shell
# Edit config files
vim /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/conf.d/99-local.toml

# Reload without restarting
pkill -HUP kubernetes-mcp-server
```

### MCP Prompts

1. The server supports MCP prompts for workflow templates. Define custom prompts in `config.toml`:

```toml
[[prompts]]
name = &quot;my-workflow&quot;
title = &quot;my workflow&quot;
description = &quot;Custom workflow&quot;

[[prompts.arguments]]
name = &quot;resource_name&quot;
required = true

[[prompts.messages]]
role = &quot;user&quot;
content = &quot;Help me with {{resource_name}}&quot;
```

2. Toolset prompts implemented by toolset developers

See docs/PROMPTS.md for detailed documentation.

## 🛠️ Tools and Functionalities &lt;a id=&quot;tools-and-functionalities&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Kubernetes MCP server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of tools and functionalities (tools, resources, prompts, and so on) via the `--toolsets` command-line flag or `toolsets` configuration option.
This allows you to control which Kubernetes functionalities are available to your AI tools.
Enabling only the toolsets you need can help reduce the context size and improve the LLM&#039;s tool selection accuracy.

### Available Toolsets

The following sets of tools are available (toolsets marked with ✓ in the Default column are enabled by default):

&lt;!-- AVAILABLE-TOOLSETS-START --&gt;

&lt;!-- AVAILABLE-TOOLSETS-END --&gt;

### Tools

In case multi-cluster support is enabled (default) and you have access to multiple clusters, all applicable tools will include an additional `context` argument to specify the Kubernetes context (cluster) to use for that operation.

&lt;!-- AVAILABLE-TOOLSETS-TOOLS-START --&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;config&lt;/summary&gt;

- **configuration_contexts_list** - List all available context names and associated server urls from the kubeconfig file

- **configuration_view** - Get the current Kubernetes configuration content as a kubeconfig YAML
  - `minified` (`boolean`) - Return a minified version of the configuration. If set to true, keeps only the current-context and the relevant pieces of the configuration for that context. If set to false, all contexts, clusters, auth-infos, and users are returned in the configuration. (Optional, default true)

&lt;/details&gt;
