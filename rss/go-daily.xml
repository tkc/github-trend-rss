Organize your photos &amp; videos, chats &amp; messages, location history, social media content, contacts, and more into a single cohesive timeline on your own computer where you can keep them alive forever.

Timelinize lets you import your data from practically anywhere: your computer, phone, online accounts, GPS-enabled radios, various apps and programs, contact lists, cameras, and more.

**[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/C9dCnTW6qV)** to discuss!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; I am looking for a better name for this project. If you have an idea for a good name that is short, relevant, unique, and available, [I&#039;d love to hear it!](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues/2)

## Screenshots

These were captured using a dev repository of mine filled with a subset of my real data, so I&#039;ve run Timelinize in obfuscation mode: images and videos are blurred (except profile pictures---need to fix that); names, identifiers, and locations around sensitive areas are all randomized, and text has been replaced with random words so that the string is about the same length.

(I hope to make a video tour soon.)

**Please remember this is an early alpha preview, and the software is very much evolving and improving. And you can help!**

| ---- | ---- |
![WIP Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293cbe57-ac75-4c4b-b78a-b75f6d442d99) WIP dashboard. **Very** WIP. The bubble chart is particularly interesting as it shows you what kinds of data are most common at which times of day throughout the years. | ![Timeline view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f808c4-7b0e-4ad0-b12a-6398f6321272) The classic timeline view is a combination of all data grouped by types and time segments for reconstructing a day or other custom time period.
![Item view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f5671c-df85-4af5-9f67-6358e7489442) Viewing an item shows all the information about it, regardless of type: text, photo, live photo, video, location, etc. | ![File picker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf2482e-58a5-434f-a0d2-f9b1274af106) I had to make a custom file picker since browser APIs are too limiting. This is how you&#039;ll import most of your data into your timeline, but this flow is being revised soon.
![3D map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051031c1-0659-4388-b01f-475bb4d24490) The large map view is capable of 3D exploration, showing your memories right where they happened with a color-coded path that represents time. | ![Map showing non-geolocated data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ddbe3cd-4bdc-4d3a-be92-d9c41e29ee1b) Because Timelinize is entity-aware and supports multiple data sources, it can show data on a map even if it doesn&#039;t have geolocation information. That&#039;s what the gray dots or pins represent. In this example, a text message was received while at church, even though it doesn&#039;t have any geolocation info associated with it directly.
![Entities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832c6bce-029c-4abf-943e-84253458a9f7) Timelinize treats entities (people, pets/animals, organizations, etc.) as first-class data points which you can filter and organize. | ![Merge entities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932259b1-fc1d-40bc-b27d-a58e37537c4c) Timelinize will automatically recognize the same entity across data sources with enough information, but if it isn&#039;t possible automatically, you can manually merge entities with a click.
![Conversations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0973df3c-eba9-49b8-b369-0e44f4120c37) Conversations are aggregated across data sources that have messaging capabilities. They become emergent from the database by querying relationships between items and entities. | ![Conversation view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ece383-6702-47ed-8f11-6c95af0cc3de) In this conversation view, you can see messages exchanged with this person across both Facebook and SMS/text message are displayed together. Reactions are also supported.
![Gallery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe89db8e-66b1-4854-9d47-a774bf20961f) A gallery displays photos and videos, but not just those in your photo library: it includes pictures and memes sent via messages, photos and videos uploaded to social media, and any other photos/videos in your data. You can always filter to drill down.


## How it works

1. [Obtain your data.](https://timelinize.com/docs/data-preparation) This usually involves exporting your data from apps, online accounts, or devices. For example, requesting an archive from Google Takeout. (Apple iCloud, Facebook, Twitter/X, Strava, Instagram, etc. all offer similar functionality for GDPR compliance.) Do this early/soon, because some services take days to provide your data.
2. Import your data using Timelinize. You don&#039;t need to extract or decompress .tar or .zip archives; Timelinize will attempt to recognize your data in its original format and folder structure. All the data you import is indexed in a SQLite database and stored on disk organized by date -- no obfuscation or proprietary formats; you can simply browse your files if you wish.
3. Explore and organize! Timelinize has a UI that portrays data using various projections and filters. It can recall moments from your past and help you view your life more comprehensively. (It&#039;s a great living family history tool.)
4. Repeat steps 1-3 as often as desired. Timelinize will skip any existing data that is the same and only import new content. You could do this every few weeks or months for busy accounts that are most important to you.

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Timelinize is in active development and is still considered unstable. The schema is still changing, necessitating starting over from a clean slate when updating. Always keep your original source data. Expect to delete and recreate your timelines as you upgrade during this alpha development period.

## Download and run

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/releases/latest) for your platform.

See the website for [installation instructions](https://timelinize.com/docs/install).

## Develop

See our [project wiki](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/) for instructions on [compiling from source](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/Develop).


## Command line interface

Timelinize has a symmetric HTTP API and CLI. When an HTTP API endpoint is created in the code, it automatically adds to the command line as well.

Run `timelinize help` (or `go run main.go help` if you&#039;re running from source) to view the list of commands, which are also HTTP endpoints. JSON or form inputs are converted to command line args/flags that represent the JSON schema or form fields.

&lt;!-- &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Wails UI info (no longer used)&lt;/summary&gt;

## Wails v2 (native GUI) info

The last commit that used Wails (v2) was b9b80838b2b92501139f2f0c5fab63921a7e6502.
That can be used as a reference if we ever switch back to Wails. The last working
commit that had Wails that was released as a dev preview was
bcb0f732e01e5b0e34a142a35b658a1f328c4c6d.

In July-August 2023 we transitioned away from Wails and went to a client/server
model for stability and flexibility. Wails itself was great, the main problem
was the poor performance of Webkit2GTK, even on Mac it was pretty bad (frequent
crashes).

The instructions below are preserved here for reference in case that comes
in handy, though the commits above also have this in their READMEs:

### Development

Run commands in the project root:

#### Linux, macOS

```bash
$ wails dev
```

#### Windows

```powershell
$env:CC=&quot;zig cc&quot;; $env:CXX=&quot;zig c++&quot;; wails dev
```

Or, if cross-compiling:

```powershell
&gt; $env:CC=&quot;zig cc -target x86_64-windows&quot;; $env:CXX=&quot;zig c++ -target x86_64-windows&quot;; wails dev
```

&lt;/details&gt; --&gt;

## Setup Development Environment
Dev Container setup is provided for easy development using GitHub Codespaces or Visual Studio Code with the DevContainers extension.

### Getting started with VSCode
1. Make sure you have the following installed:

	- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
	- [DevContainers for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. Open this project in VSCode
3. Go to the __Remote Explorer__ on Activity Bar
4. Click on __New Dev Container (+)__
5. Click on __Open Current Folder in Container__

This sets up a docker container with all the dependencies required for building this project. You can get started with contributing quickly.


## Motivation and vision

(For roadmap, see [issues tagged `long-term 🔭`](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22long-term%20%F0%9F%94%AD%22).)

The motivation for this project is two-fold. Both press upon me with a sense of urgency, which is why I dedicated some nights and weekends to work on this.

1. Connecting with my family -- both living and deceased -- is important to me and my close relatives. But I wish we had more insights into the lives of those who came before us. What was important to them? Where did they live / travel / spend their time? What lessons did they learn? How did global and local events -- or heck, even the weather -- affect them? What hardships did they endure? What would they have wanted to remember? What would it be like to talk to them? A lot of this could not be known unless they wrote it all down. But these days, we have that data for ourselves. What better time than right now to start collecting personal histories from all available sources and develop a rich timeline of our life for our family, or even just for our own reference and nostalgia.

2. Our lives are better-documented than any before us, but the record of our life is more ephemeral than any before us, too. We lose control of our data by relying on centralized, proprietary apps and cloud services which are useful today, and gone tomorrow. I wrote Timelinize because now is the time to liberate my data from corporations who don&#039;t own it, yet who have the only copy of it. This reality has made me feel uneasy for years, and it&#039;s not going away soon. Timelinize makes it bearable.

Imagine being able to pull up a single screen with your data from any and all of your online accounts and services -- while offline. And there you see so many aspects of your life at a glance: your photos and videos, social media posts, locations on a map and how you got there, emails and letters, documents, health and physical activities, mental and emotional wellness, and maybe even music you listened to, for any given day. You can &quot;zoom out&quot; and get the big picture. Machine learning algorithms could suggest major clusters based on your content to summarize your days, months, or years, and from that, even recommend printing physical memorabilia. It&#039;s like a highly-detailed, automated journal, fully in your control, which you can add to in the app: augment it with your own thoughts like a regular journal.

Then cross-reference your own timeline with a global public timeline: see how locations you went to changed over time, or what major news events may have affected you, or what the political/social climate -- or the literal climate -- was like at the time. For example, you may wonder, &quot;Why did the family stay inside so much of the summer one year?&quot; You could then see, &quot;Oh, because it was 110 F (43 C) degrees for two months straight.&quot;

Or translate the projection sideways, and instead of looking at time cross-sections, look at cross-sections of your timeline by media type: photos, posts, location, sentiment. Look at plots, charts, graphs, of your physical activity.

Or view projections by space instead of time: view interrelations between items on a map, even items that don&#039;t have location data, because the database is entity-aware. So if a person receives a text message and the same person has location information at about the same time from a photo or GPS device, then the text message can appear on a map too, reminding you where you first got the text with the news about your nephew&#039;s birth.

And all of this runs on your own computer: no one else has access to it, no one else owns it, but you.

And if everyone had their own timeline, in theory they could be merged into a global supertimeline to become a thorough record of the human race, all without the need for centralizing our data on cloud services that are controlled by greedy corporations.

## History

I&#039;ve been working on this project since about 2013, even before I conceptualized [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com). My initial vision was to create an automated backup of my Picasa albums that I could store on my own hard drive. This project was called Photobak. Picasa eventually became Google Photos, and about the same time I realized I wanted to backup my photos posted to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, too. And while I was at it, why not include my Google Location History to augment the location data from the photos. The vision continued to expand as I realized that my family could use this too, so the schema was upgraded to support multiple people/entities as well. This could allow us to merge databases, or timelines, as family members pass, or as they share parts of their timeline around with each other. Timelinize is the mature evolution of the original project that is now designed to be a comprehensive, highly detailed archive of one&#039;s life through digital (or _digitized_) content. An authoritative, unified record that is easy to preserve and organize.

## License

This project is licensed with AGPL. I chose this license because I do not want others to make proprietary or commercial software using this package. The point of this project is liberation of and control over one&#039;s own, personal data, and I want to ensure that this project won&#039;t be used in anything that would perpetuate the walled garden dilemma we already face today. Even if the future of this project ever has proprietary source code, I can ensure it will stay aligned with my values and the project&#039;s original goals.

2. **运行程序**：执行 `chatlog` 启动 Terminal UI 界面
3. **解密数据**：选择 `解密数据` 菜单项
4. **开启 HTTP 服务**：选择 `开启 HTTP 服务` 菜单项
5. **访问数据**：通过 [HTTP API](#http-api) 或 [MCP 集成](#mcp-集成) 访问聊天记录

&gt; 💡 **提示**: 如果电脑端微信聊天记录不全，可以[从手机端迁移数据](#从手机迁移聊天记录)  

### 常见问题快速解决

- **macOS 用户**：获取密钥前需[临时关闭 SIP](#macos-版本说明)
- **Windows 用户**：遇到界面显示问题请[使用 Windows Terminal](#windows-版本说明)
- **集成 AI 助手**：查看 [MCP 集成指南](#mcp-集成)
- **无法获取密钥**：查看 [FAQ](https://github.com/sjzar/chatlog/issues/197)

## 安装指南

### 从源码安装

```bash
go install github.com/sjzar/chatlog@latest
```

&gt; 💡 **提示**: 部分功能有 cgo 依赖，编译前需确认本地有 C 编译环境。

### 下载预编译版本

访问 [Releases](https://github.com/sjzar/chatlog/releases) 页面下载适合您系统的预编译版本。

## 使用指南

### Terminal UI 模式

最简单的使用方式是通过 Terminal UI 界面操作：

```bash
chatlog
```

操作方法：
- 使用 `↑` `↓` 键选择菜单项
- 按 `Enter` 确认选择
- 按 `Esc` 返回上级菜单
- 按 `Ctrl+C` 退出程序

### 命令行模式

对于熟悉命令行的用户，可以直接使用以下命令：

```bash
# 获取微信数据密钥
chatlog key

# 解密数据库文件
chatlog decrypt

# 启动 HTTP 服务
chatlog server
```

### Docker 部署

由于 Docker 部署时，程序运行环境与宿主机隔离，所以不支持获取密钥等操作，需要提前获取密钥数据。

一般用于 NAS 等设备部署，详细指南可参考 [Docker 部署指南](docs/docker.md)

**0. 获取密钥信息**

```shell
# 从本机运行 chatlog 获取密钥信息
$ chatlog key
Data Key: [c0163e***ac3dc6]
Image Key: [38636***653361]
```

**1. 拉取镜像**

chatlog 提供了两个镜像源：

**Docker Hub**:
```shell
docker pull sjzar/chatlog:latest
```

**GitHub Container Registry (ghcr)**:
```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/sjzar/chatlog:latest
```

&gt; 💡 **镜像地址**: 
&gt; - Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/sjzar/chatlog
&gt; - GitHub Container Registry: https://ghcr.io/sjzar/chatlog

**2. 运行容器**

```shell
$ docker run -d \
  --name chatlog \
  -p 5030:5030 \
  -v /path/to/your/wechat/data:/app/data \
  sjzar/chatlog:latest
```

### 从手机迁移聊天记录

如果电脑端微信聊天记录不全，可以从手机端迁移数据：

1. 打开手机微信，进入 `我 - 设置 - 通用 - 聊天记录迁移与备份`
2. 选择 `迁移 - 迁移到电脑`，按照提示操作
3. 完成迁移后，重新运行 `chatlog` 获取密钥并解密数据

&gt; 此操作不会影响手机上的聊天记录，只是将数据复制到电脑端

## 平台特定说明

### Windows 版本说明

如遇到界面显示异常（如花屏、乱码等），请使用 [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) 运行程序

### macOS 版本说明

macOS 用户在获取密钥前需要临时关闭 SIP（系统完整性保护）：

1. **关闭 SIP**：
   ```shell
   # 进入恢复模式
   # Intel Mac: 重启时按住 Command + R
   # Apple Silicon: 重启时长按电源键
   
   # 在恢复模式中打开终端并执行
   csrutil disable
   
   # 重启系统
   ```

2. **安装必要工具**：
   ```shell
   # 安装 Xcode Command Line Tools
   xcode-select --install
   ```

3. **获取密钥后**：可以重新启用 SIP（`csrutil enable`），不影响后续使用

&gt; Apple Silicon 用户注意：确保微信、chatlog 和终端都不在 Rosetta 模式下运行

## HTTP API

启动 HTTP 服务后（默认地址 `http://127.0.0.1:5030`），可通过以下 API 访问数据：

### 聊天记录查询

```
GET /api/v1/chatlog?time=2023-01-01&amp;talker=wxid_xxx
```

参数说明：
- `time`: 时间范围，格式为 `YYYY-MM-DD` 或 `YYYY-MM-DD~YYYY-MM-DD`
- `talker`: 聊天对象标识（支持 wxid、群聊 ID、备注名、昵称等）
- `limit`: 返回记录数量
- `offset`: 分页偏移量
- `format`: 输出格式，支持 `json`、`csv` 或纯文本

### 其他 API 接口

- **联系人列表**：`GET /api/v1/contact`
- **群聊列表**：`GET /api/v1/chatroom`
- **会话列表**：`GET /api/v1/session`

### 多媒体内容

聊天记录中的多媒体内容会通过 HTTP 服务进行提供，可通过以下路径访问：

- **图片内容**：`GET /image/&lt;id&gt;`
- **视频内容**：`GET /video/&lt;id&gt;`
- **文件内容**：`GET /file/&lt;id&gt;`
- **语音内容**：`GET /voice/&lt;id&gt;`
- **多媒体内容**：`GET /data/&lt;data dir relative path&gt;`

当请求图片、视频、文件内容时，将返回 302 跳转到多媒体内容 URL。  
当请求语音内容时，将直接返回语音内容，并对原始 SILK 语音做了实时转码 MP3 处理。  
多媒体内容 URL 地址为基于`数据目录`的相对地址，请求多媒体内容将直接返回对应文件，并针对加密图片做了实时解密处理。

## Webhook

需开启自动解密功能，当收到特定新消息时，可以通过 HTTP POST 请求将消息推送到指定的 URL。

&gt; 延迟测试: 本地服务消息回调延迟约 13 秒; 远程同步消息回调延迟约 45 秒。

#### 0. 回调配置

使用 TUI 模式的话，在 `$HOME/.chatlog/chatlog.json` 配置文件中，新增 `webhook` 配置。  
（Windows 用户的配置文件在 `%USERPROFILE%/.chatlog/chatlog.json`)

```json
{
  &quot;history&quot;: [],
  &quot;last_account&quot;: &quot;wxuser_x&quot;,
  &quot;webhook&quot;: {
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;localhost:5030&quot;,                   # 消息中的图片、文件等 URL host
    &quot;items&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8080/webhook&quot;, # 必填，webhook 请求的URL，可配置为 n8n 等 webhook 入口 
        &quot;talker&quot;: &quot;wxid_123&quot;,                   # 必填，需要监控的私聊、群聊名称
        &quot;sender&quot;: &quot;&quot;,                           # 选填，消息发送者
        &quot;keyword&quot;: &quot;&quot;                           # 选填，关键词
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

使用 server 模式的话，可以通过 `CHATLOG_WEBHOOK` 环境变量进行设置。

      }
    }
  ],
  &quot;sender&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;talker&quot;: &quot;wxid_123&quot;
}
```

## MCP 集成

Chatlog 支持 MCP (Model Context Protocol) 协议，可与支持 MCP 的 AI 助手无缝集成。  
启动 HTTP 服务后，通过 Streamable HTTP Endpoint 访问服务：

```
GET /mcp
```

### 快速集成

Chatlog 可以与多种支持 MCP 的 AI 助手集成，包括：

- **ChatWise**: 直接支持 Streamable HTTP，在工具设置中添加 `http://127.0.0.1:5030/mcp`
- **Cherry Studio**: 直接支持 Streamable HTTP，在 MCP 服务器设置中添加 `http://127.0.0.1:5030/mcp`

对于不直接支持 Streamable HTTP 的客户端，可以使用 [mcp-proxy](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy) 工具转发请求：

- **Claude Desktop**: 通过 mcp-proxy 支持，需要配置 `claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Monica Code**: 通过 mcp-proxy 支持，需要配置 VSCode 插件设置

# Overview

**Eino[&#039;aino]** (pronounced similarly to &quot;I know&quot;) aims to be the ultimate LLM application development framework in Golang. Drawing inspirations from many excellent LLM application development frameworks in the open-source community such as LangChain &amp; LlamaIndex, etc., as well as learning from cutting-edge research and real world applications, Eino offers an LLM application development framework that emphasizes on simplicity, scalability, reliability and effectiveness that better aligns with Golang programming conventions.

What Eino provides are:
- a carefully curated list of **component** abstractions and implementations that can be easily reused and combined to build LLM applications
- a powerful **composition** framework that does the heavy lifting of strong type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection, option assignment, etc. for the user.
- a set of meticulously designed **API** that obsesses on simplicity and clarity.
- an ever-growing collection of best practices in the form of bundled **flows** and **examples**.
- a useful set of tools that covers the entire development cycle, from visualized development and debugging to online tracing and evaluation.

With the above arsenal, Eino can standardize, simplify, and improve efficiency at different stages of the AI application development cycle:
![](.github/static/img/eino/eino_concept.jpeg)

# A quick walkthrough

Use a component directly:
```Go
model, _ := openai.NewChatModel(ctx, config) // create an invokable LLM instance
message, _ := model.Generate(ctx, []*Message{
    SystemMessage(&quot;you are a helpful assistant.&quot;),
    UserMessage(&quot;what does the future AI App look like?&quot;)})
```

Of course, you can do that, Eino provides lots of useful components to use out of the box. But you can do more by using orchestration, for three reasons:
- orchestration encapsulates common patterns of LLM application.
- orchestration solves the difficult problem of processing stream response by the LLM.
- orchestration handles type safety, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment for you.

Eino provides three set of APIs for orchestration

| API      | Characteristics and usage                                             |
| -------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chain    | Simple chained directed graph that can only go forward.               |
| Graph    | Cyclic or Acyclic directed graph. Powerful and flexible.              |
| Workflow | Acyclic graph that supports data mapping at struct field level. |

Let&#039;s create a simple chain: a ChatTemplate followed by a ChatModel.

![](.github/static/img/eino/simple_chain.png)

```Go
chain, _ := NewChain[map[string]any, *Message]().
           AppendChatTemplate(prompt).
           AppendChatModel(model).
           Compile(ctx)

chain.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;what&#039;s your name?&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a graph that uses a ChatModel to generate answer or tool calls, then uses a ToolsNode to execute those tools if needed.

![](.github/static/img/eino/tool_call_graph.png)

```Go
graph := NewGraph[map[string]any, *schema.Message]()

_ = graph.AddChatTemplateNode(&quot;node_template&quot;, chatTpl)
_ = graph.AddChatModelNode(&quot;node_model&quot;, chatModel)
_ = graph.AddToolsNode(&quot;node_tools&quot;, toolsNode)
_ = graph.AddLambdaNode(&quot;node_converter&quot;, takeOne)

_ = graph.AddEdge(START, &quot;node_template&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_template&quot;, &quot;node_model&quot;)
_ = graph.AddBranch(&quot;node_model&quot;, branch)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_tools&quot;, &quot;node_converter&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_converter&quot;, END)

compiledGraph, err := graph.Compile(ctx)
if err != nil {
return err
}
out, err := compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;:&quot;Beijing&#039;s weather this weekend&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a workflow that flexibly maps input &amp; output at the field level:

![](.github/static/img/eino/simple_workflow.png)

```Go
type Input1 struct {
    Input string
}

type Output1 struct {
    Output string
}

type Input2 struct {
    Role schema.RoleType
}

type Output2 struct {
    Output string
}

type Input3 struct {
    Query string
    MetaData string
}

var (
    ctx context.Context
    m model.BaseChatModel
    lambda1 func(context.Context, Input1) (Output1, error)
    lambda2 func(context.Context, Input2) (Output2, error)
    lambda3 func(context.Context, Input3) (*schema.Message, error)
)

wf := NewWorkflow[[]*schema.Message, *schema.Message]()
wf.AddChatModelNode(&quot;model&quot;, m).AddInput(START)
wf.AddLambdaNode(&quot;lambda1&quot;, InvokableLambda(lambda1)).
    AddInput(&quot;model&quot;, MapFields(&quot;Content&quot;, &quot;Input&quot;))
wf.AddLambdaNode(&quot;lambda2&quot;, InvokableLambda(lambda2)).
    AddInput(&quot;model&quot;, MapFields(&quot;Role&quot;, &quot;Role&quot;))
wf.AddLambdaNode(&quot;lambda3&quot;, InvokableLambda(lambda3)).
    AddInput(&quot;lambda1&quot;, MapFields(&quot;Output&quot;, &quot;Query&quot;)).
    AddInput(&quot;lambda2&quot;, MapFields(&quot;Output&quot;, &quot;MetaData&quot;))
wf.End().AddInput(&quot;lambda3&quot;)
runnable, err := wf.Compile(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
our, err := runnable.Invoke(ctx, []*schema.Message{
    schema.UserMessage(&quot;kick start this workflow!&quot;),
})
```

Now let&#039;s create a &#039;ReAct&#039; agent: A ChatModel binds to Tools. It receives input Messages and decides independently whether to call the Tool or output the final result. The execution result of the Tool will again become the input Message for the ChatModel and serve as the context for the next round of independent judgment.

![](.github/static/img/eino/react.png)

We provide a complete implementation for ReAct Agent out of the box in the `flow` package. Check out the code here: [flow/agent/react](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino/blob/main/flow/agent/react/react.go)

Our implementation of ReAct Agent uses Eino&#039;s **graph orchestration** exclusively, which provides the following benefits out of the box:
- Type checking: it makes sure the two nodes&#039; input and output types match at compile time.
- Stream processing: concatenates message stream before passing to chatModel and toolsNode if needed, and copies the stream into callback handlers.
- Concurrency management: the shared state can be safely read and written because the StatePreHandler is concurrency safe.
- Aspect injection: injects callback aspects before and after the execution of ChatModel if the specified ChatModel implementation hasn&#039;t injected itself.
- Option assignment: call options are assigned either globally, to specific component type or to specific node.

For example, you could easily extend the compiled graph with callbacks:
```Go
handler := NewHandlerBuilder().
  OnStartFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, input CallbackInput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onStart, runInfo: %v, input: %v&quot;, info, input)
    }).
  OnEndFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, output CallbackOutput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onEnd, runInfo: %v, out: %v&quot;, info, output)
    }).
  Build()
  
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))
```

or you could easily assign options to different nodes:
```Go
// assign to All nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))

// assign only to ChatModel nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithChatModelOption(WithTemperature(0.5))

// assign only to node_1
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler).DesignateNode(&quot;node_1&quot;))
```

# Key Features

## Rich Components

- Encapsulates common building blocks into **component abstractions**, each have multiple **component implementations** that are ready to be used out of the box.
    - component abstractions such as ChatModel, Tool, ChatTemplate, Retriever, Document Loader, Lambda, etc.
    - each component type has an interface of its own: defined Input &amp; Output Type, defined Option type, and streaming paradigms that make sense.
    - implementations are transparent. Abstractions are all you care about when orchestrating components together.

- Implementations can be nested and captures complex business logic.
    - ReAct Agent, MultiQueryRetriever, Host MultiAgent, etc. They consist of multiple components and non-trivial business logic.
    - They are still transparent from the outside. A MultiQueryRetriever can be used anywhere that accepts a Retriever.

## Powerful Orchestration

- Data flows from Retriever / Document Loaders / ChatTemplate to ChatModel, then flows to Tools and parsed as Final Answer. This directed, controlled flow of data through multiple components can be implemented through **graph orchestration**.
- Component instances are graph nodes, and edges are data flow channels.
- Graph orchestration is powerful and flexible enough to implement complex business logic:
  - type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment are handled by the framework.
  - branch out execution at runtime, read and write global state, or do field level data mapping using workflow(currently in alpha stage).


## Complete Stream Processing

- Stream processing is important because ChatModel outputs chunks of messages in real time as it generates them. It&#039;s especially important with orchestration because more components need to handle streaming data.
- Eino automatically **concatenates** stream chunks for downstream nodes that only accepts non-stream input, such as ToolsNode.
- Eino automatically **boxes** non stream into stream when stream is needed during graph execution.  
- Eino automatically **merges** multiple streams as they converge into a single downward node.
- Eino automatically **copies** stream as they fan out to different downward node, or is passed to callback handlers.
- Orchestration elements such as **branch** and **state handlers** are also stream aware.
- With these streaming processing abilities, the streaming paradigms of components themselves become transparent to the user. 
- A compiled Graph can run with 4 different streaming paradigms:

| Streaming Paradigm | Explanation                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invoke             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns non-stream type O                     |
| Stream             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns stream type StreamReader[O]           |
| Collect            | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns non-stream type O           |
| Transform          | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns stream type StreamReader[O] |

## Highly Extensible Aspects (Callbacks)

- Aspects handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, tracing, metrics, etc., as well as exposing internal details of component implementations.
- Five aspects are supported: **OnStart, OnEnd, OnError, OnStartWithStreamInput, OnEndWithStreamOutput**.
- Developers can easily create custom callback handlers, add them during graph run via options, and they will be invoked during graph run.
- Graph can also inject aspects to those component implementations that do not support callbacks on their own.

## What is frp?

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone&#039;s needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh1&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-a.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh2&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-b.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-a.example.com`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-b.example.com`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhostHTTPSPort`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;web&quot;
  type = &quot;http&quot;
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = [&quot;www.example.com&quot;]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;dns&quot;
  type = &quot;udp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  unixPath = &quot;/var/run/docker.sock&quot;
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_static_file&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;static_file&quot;
  localPath = &quot;/tmp/files&quot;
  stripPrefix = &quot;static&quot;
  httpUser = &quot;abc&quot;
  httpPassword = &quot;abc&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `localAddr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_https2http&quot;
  type = &quot;https&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;test.example.com&quot;]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;https2http&quot;
  localAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:80&quot;
  crtPath = &quot;./server.crt&quot;
  keyPath = &quot;./server.key&quot;
  hostHeaderRewrite = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = &quot;frp&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `secretKey` field for the preshared key, and that the `remotePort` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`secretKey` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn&#039;t work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

These configuration files is for reference only. Please do not use this configuration directly to run the program as it may have various issues.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps_full_example.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc_full_example.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go&#039;s standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}&quot;
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = {{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remember to prefix your reference with `.Envs`.

### 1.2 贡献指南
Hi! 首先感谢你使用 gin-vue-admin。

Gin-vue-admin 是一套为快速研发准备的一整套前后端分离架构式的开源框架，旨在快速搭建中小型项目。

Gin-vue-admin 的成长离不开大家的支持，如果你愿意为 gin-vue-admin 贡献代码或提供建议，请阅读以下内容。

#### 1.2.1 Issue 规范
- issue 仅用于提交 Bug 或 Feature 以及设计相关的内容，其它内容可能会被直接关闭。
									      
- 在提交 issue 之前，请搜索相关内容是否已被提出。

#### 1.2.2 Pull Request 规范
- 请先 fork 一份到自己的项目下，不要直接在仓库下建分支。

- commit 信息要以`[文件名]: 描述信息` 的形式填写，例如 `README.md: fix xxx bug`。

- 如果是修复 bug，请在 PR 中给出描述信息。

- 合并代码需要两名维护人员参与：一人进行 review 后 approve，另一人再次 review，通过后即可合并。

## 2. 使用说明

```
- node版本 &gt; v18.16.0
- golang版本 &gt;= v1.22
- IDE推荐：Goland
```

### 2.1 server项目

使用 `Goland` 等编辑工具，打开server目录，不可以打开 gin-vue-admin 根目录

```bash

# 克隆项目
git clone https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin.git
# 进入server文件夹
cd server

# 使用 go mod 并安装go依赖包
go generate

# 运行
go run . 

```

### 2.2 web项目

```bash
# 进入web文件夹
cd web

# 安装依赖
npm install

# 启动web项目
npm run serve
```

### 2.3 swagger自动化API文档

#### 2.3.1 安装 swagger

``` shell
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

#### 2.3.2 生成API文档

```` shell
cd server
swag init
````

&gt; 执行上面的命令后，server目录下会出现docs文件夹里的 `docs.go`, `swagger.json`, `swagger.yaml` 三个文件更新，启动go服务之后, 在浏览器输入 [http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html) 即可查看swagger文档

### 2.4 VSCode工作区

#### 2.4.1 开发

使用`VSCode`打开根目录下的工作区文件`gin-vue-admin.code-workspace`，在边栏可以看到三个虚拟目录：`backend`、`frontend`、`root`。

#### 2.4.2 运行/调试

在运行和调试中也可以看到三个task：`Backend`、`Frontend`、`Both (Backend &amp; Frontend)`。运行`Both (Backend &amp; Frontend)`可以同时启动前后端项目。

#### 2.4.3 settings

在工作区配置文件中有`go.toolsEnvVars`字段，是用于`VSCode`自身的go工具环境变量。此外在多go版本的系统中，可以通过`gopath`、`go.goroot`指定运行版本。

```json
    &quot;go.gopath&quot;: null,
    &quot;go.goroot&quot;: null,
```

## 3. 技术选型

- 前端：用基于 [Vue](https://vuejs.org) 的 [Element](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element) 构建基础页面。
- 后端：用 [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) 快速搭建基础restful风格API，[Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) 是一个go语言编写的Web框架。
- 数据库：采用`MySql` &gt; (5.7) 版本 数据库引擎 InnoDB，使用 [gorm](http://gorm.cn) 实现对数据库的基本操作。
- 缓存：使用`Redis`实现记录当前活跃用户的`jwt`令牌并实现多点登录限制。
- API文档：使用`Swagger`构建自动化文档。
- 配置文件：使用 [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) 和 [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) 实现`yaml`格式的配置文件。
- 日志：使用 [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) 实现日志记录。

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Docker MCP Plugin and Docker MCP Gateway

![build](https://github.com/docker/mcp-gateway/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

The [MCP Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/), in Docker Desktop, allows
developers to configure and consume MCP servers from the [Docker MCP Catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp).

Underneath, the Toolkit is powered by a docker CLI plugin: `docker-mcp`. This repository is the code of this CLI plugin. It can work in Docker Desktop or independently.

The main feature of this CLI is the **Docker MCP Gateway** which allows easy and secure running and deployment of MCP servers. See [Features](#Features) for a list of all the features.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect to external data sources and tools. It provides a secure, controlled way for language models to access and interact with various services, databases, and APIs.

## Overview

Developers face criticial barriers when integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools into production workflows:

- **Managing MCP server lifecycle** Each local MCP sever in the catalog runs in an isolated Docker container. npx and uvx servers are granted minimal host privileges.
- **Providing a unified interface** AI models access MCP servers through a single Gateway.
- **Handling authentication and security** Keep secrets out of environment variables using Docker Desktop&#039;s secrets management.
- **Supports dynamic tool discovery** and configuration. Each MCP client (eg VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) connects to the same Gateway configuration, ensuring consistency across different clients.
- **Enables OAuth flows** for MCPs that require OAuth access token service connections.

## Features

- 🐳 **Container-based Servers**: Run MCP servers as Docker containers with proper isolation.
- 🔧 **Server Management**: List, inspect, and call MCP tools, resources and prompts from multiple servers.
- 🔐 **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of API keys and credentials via Docker Desktop.
- 🌐 **OAuth Integration**: Built-in OAuth flows for service authentication.
- 📋 **Server Catalog**: Manage and configure multiple MCP catalogs.
- 🔍 **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatic tool, prompt, and resource discovery from running servers.
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and call tracing capabilities.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (with MCP Toolkit feature enabled)

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./img/enable_toolkit.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
- Go 1.24+ (for development)

### Install as Docker CLI Plugin

The MCP cli will already be installed on recent versions of Docker Desktop but you can build and install the latest version by following these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/docker/mcp-gateway.git
cd mcp-gateway
mkdir -p &quot;$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins/&quot;

# Build and install the plugin
make docker-mcp
```

After installation, the plugin will be available as:

```bash
docker mcp --help
```

## Usage

### Catalog Management

Manage the catalogs available to the MCP gateway. The [default catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp) is available with the name &#039;docker-mcp&#039;.

```bash
# Manage server catalogs
docker mcp catalog --help

# Initialize the default Docker MCP Catalog
docker mcp catalog init

# List available catalogs
docker mcp catalog ls

# Show all servers in a catalog
docker mcp catalog show docker-mcp
```

* more about [the MCP Catalog](docs/catalog.md).
* more about [importing from the OSS MCP Community Registry](docs/catalog.md#importing-from-the-oss-mcp-community-registry).

### MCP Gateway Operations

Start up an MCP Gateway. This can be used for one client, or to service multiple clients if using either `sse` or `streaming` transports.

```bash
# Run the MCP gateway (stdio)
docker mcp gateway run

# Run the MCP gateway (streaming)
docker mcp gateway run --port 8080 --transport streaming
```

* more about [the MCP Gateway](docs/mcp-gateway.md)
* [running an unpublished local image](docs/self-configured.md)

### Server Management

Enable and disable the set of MCP servers that will be available for default clients. The MCP gateway can be configured to expose different sets of servers and tools but enabling and disabling servers here impacts the default gateway configuration.

```bash
# List enabled servers
docker mcp server ls

# Enable one or more servers
docker mcp server enable &lt;server-name&gt; [server-name...]

# Disable servers
docker mcp server disable &lt;server-name&gt; [server-name...]

# Get detailed information about a server
docker mcp server inspect &lt;server-name&gt;

# Reset (disable all servers)
docker mcp server reset
```

### Configuration Management

Configure any MCP servers that require custom runtime configuration.

```bash
# Read current configuration
docker mcp config read

# Write new configuration
docker mcp config write &#039;&lt;yaml-config&gt;&#039;

# Reset configuration to defaults
docker mcp config reset
```

### Secrets and OAuth

Configure MCP servers that require either secrets or OAuth.

```bash
# Manage secrets
docker mcp secret --help

# Handle OAuth flows
docker mcp oauth --help

# Manage access policies
docker mcp policy --help

# export any desktop secrets needed by either server1 or server2
#   (temporary requirement to export secrets for docker cloud runs - this command
#    will no longer be required once Docker Cloud can access secret stores) 
docker mcp secret export server1 server2
```

### Tool Management

```bash
# Show available commands
docker mcp --help

# Count available tools
docker mcp tools count

# List all available MCP tools
docker mcp tools ls

# List all available MCP tools in JSON format
docker mcp tools ls --format=json

# Inspect a specific tool
docker mcp tools inspect &lt;tool-name&gt;

# Call a tool with arguments
docker mcp tools call &lt;tool-name&gt; [arguments...]
```

## Configuration

The MCP CLI uses several configuration files:

- **`docker-mcp.yaml`**: Server catalog defining available MCP servers
- **`registry.yaml`**: Registry of enabled servers
- **`config.yaml`**: Configuration per server
- **`tools.yaml`**: Enabled tools per server

Configuration files are typically stored in `~/.docker/mcp/`. This is in this directory that Docker Desktop&#039;s
MCP Toolkit with store its configuration.

## Architecture

The Docker MCP CLI implements a gateway pattern:

```
AI Client → MCP Gateway → MCP Servers (Docker Containers)
```

- **AI Client**: Language model or AI application
- **MCP Gateway**: This CLI tool managing protocol translation and routing
- **MCP Servers**: Individual MCP servers running in Docker containers

See [docs/message-flow.md](docs/message-flow.md) for detailed message flow diagrams.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Envoy AI Gateway

Envoy AI Gateway is an open source project for using [Envoy Gateway](https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway) to handle request traffic from application clients to Generative AI services.

## Usage

When using Envoy AI Gateway, we refer to a two-tier gateway pattern. **The Tier One Gateway** functions as a centralized entry point, and the **Tier Two Gateway** handles ingress traffic to a self-hosted model serving cluster.

- The **Tier One Gateway** handles authentication, top-level routing, and global rate limiting
- The **Tier Two Gateway** provides fine-grained control over self-hosted model access, with endpoint picker support for LLM inference optimization.

✨ **`samber/lo` is a Lodash-style Go library based on Go 1.18+ Generics.**

A utility library based on Go 1.18+ generics that makes it easier to work with slices, maps, strings, channels, and functions. It provides dozens of handy methods to simplify common coding tasks and improve code readability. It may look like [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) in some aspects.

5 to 10 helpers may overlap with those from the Go standard library, in packages `slices` and `maps`. I feel this library is legitimate and offers many more valuable abstractions.

	I’m going all-in on open-source for the coming months.
	&lt;br&gt;
	Help sustain development: Become an &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/sponsors/samber&quot;&gt;individual sponsor&lt;/a&gt; or join as a &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hey@samuel-berthe.fr&quot;&gt;corporate sponsor&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

**Why this name?**

I wanted a **short name**, similar to &quot;Lodash&quot;, and no Go package uses this name.

![lo](img/logo-full.png)

## 🚀 Install

```sh
go get github.com/samber/lo@v1
```

This library is v1 and follows SemVer strictly.

No breaking changes will be made to exported APIs before v2.0.0.

This library has no dependencies outside the Go standard library.

## 💡 Usage

You can import `lo` using:

```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;
    lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;
    lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;
    loi &quot;github.com/samber/lo/it&quot;
)
```

Then use one of the helpers below:

```go
names := lo.Uniq([]string{&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Samuel&quot;})
// []string{&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;John&quot;}
```

### Tips for lazy developers

I cannot recommend it, but in case you are too lazy for repeating `lo.` everywhere, you can import the entire library into the namespace.

```go
import (
    . &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;
)
```

I take no responsibility for this junk. 😁 💩

Constraints:

- Clonable

### Filter

Iterates over a collection and returns a slice of all the elements the predicate function returns `true` for.

```go
even := lo.Filter([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int, index int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0
})
// []int{2, 4}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/Apjg3WeSi7K)]

Mutable: like `lo.Filter()`, but the slice is updated in place.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
newList := lom.Filter(list, func(x int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0
})

list
// []int{2, 4, 3, 4}

newList
// []int{2, 4}
```

### Map

Manipulates a slice of one type and transforms it into a slice of another type:

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, index int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)
})
// []string{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/OkPcYAhBo0D)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.Map()`, but the mapper function is called in a goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, _ int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)
})
// []string{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/sCJaB3quRMC)]

Mutable: like `lo.Map()`, but the slice is updated in place.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
lom.Map(list, func(x int) int {
    return x*2
})
// []int{2, 4, 6, 8}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/0jY3Z0B7O_5)]

### UniqMap

Manipulates a slice and transforms it to a slice of another type with unique values.

```go
type User struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
users := []User{{Name: &quot;Alex&quot;, Age: 10}, {Name: &quot;Alex&quot;, Age: 12}, {Name: &quot;Bob&quot;, Age: 11}, {Name: &quot;Alice&quot;, Age: 20}}

names := lo.UniqMap(users, func(u User, index int) string {
    return u.Name
})
// []string{&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/fygzLBhvUdB)]

### FilterMap

Returns a slice obtained after both filtering and mapping using the given callback function.

The callback function should return two values: the result of the mapping operation and whether the result element should be included or not.

```go
matching := lo.FilterMap([]string{&quot;cpu&quot;, &quot;gpu&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;keyboard&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) (string, bool) {
    if strings.HasSuffix(x, &quot;pu&quot;) {
        return &quot;xpu&quot;, true
    }
    return &quot;&quot;, false
})
// []string{&quot;xpu&quot;, &quot;xpu&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/-AuYXfy7opz)]

### FlatMap

Manipulates a slice and transforms and flattens it to a slice of another type. The transform function can either return a slice or a `nil`, and in the `nil` case no value is added to the final slice.

```go
lo.FlatMap([]int64{0, 1, 2}, func(x int64, _ int) []string {
    return []string{
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
    }
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/YSoYmQTA8-U)]

### Reduce

Reduces a collection to a single value. The value is calculated by accumulating the result of running each element in the collection through an accumulator function. Each successive invocation is supplied with the return value returned by the previous call.

```go
sum := lo.Reduce([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(agg int, item int, _ int) int {
    return agg + item
}, 0)
// 10
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/R4UHXZNaaUG)]

### ReduceRight

Like `lo.Reduce` except that it iterates over elements of collection from right to left.

```go
result := lo.ReduceRight([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}, func(agg []int, item []int, _ int) []int {
    return append(agg, item...)
}, []int{})
// []int{4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/Fq3W70l7wXF)]

### ForEach

Iterates over elements of a collection and invokes the function over each element.

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.ForEach([]string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints &quot;hello\nworld\n&quot;
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/oofyiUPRf8t)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.ForEach()`, but the callback is called as a goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.ForEach([]string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints &quot;hello\nworld\n&quot; or &quot;world\nhello\n&quot;
```

### ForEachWhile

Iterates over collection elements and invokes iteratee for each element collection return value decide to continue or break, like do while().

```go
list := []int64{1, 2, -42, 4}

lo.ForEachWhile(list, func(x int64, _ int) bool {
	if x &lt; 0 {
		return false
	}
	fmt.Println(x)
	return true
})
// 1
// 2
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/QnLGt35tnow)]

### Times

Times invokes the iteratee n times, returning a slice of the results of each invocation. The iteratee is invoked with index as argument.

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/vgQj3Glr6lT)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.Times()`, but callback is called in goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

### Uniq

Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice.

```go
uniqValues := lo.Uniq([]int{1, 2, 2, 1})
// []int{1, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/DTzbeXZ6iEN)]

### UniqBy

Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice. It accepts `iteratee` which is invoked for each element in the slice to generate the criterion by which uniqueness is computed.

```go
uniqValues := lo.UniqBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// []int{0, 1, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/g42Z3QSb53u)]

### GroupBy

Returns an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

groups := lo.GroupBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 3}, 1: []int{1, 4}, 2: []int{2, 5}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/XnQBd_v6brd)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.GroupBy()`, but callback is called in goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.GroupBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 3}, 1: []int{1, 4}, 2: []int{2, 5}}
```

### GroupByMap

Returns an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

groups := lo.GroupByMap([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) (int, int) {
    return i%3, i*2
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 6}, 1: []int{2, 8}, 2: []int{4, 10}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/iMeruQ3_W80)]

### Chunk

Returns a slice of elements split into groups of length size. If the slice can&#039;t be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.

```go
lo.Chunk([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2)
// [][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}

lo.Chunk([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2)
// [][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6}}

lo.Chunk([]int{}, 2)
// [][]int{}

lo.Chunk([]int{0}, 2)
// [][]int{{0}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/kEMkFbdu85g)]

### PartitionBy

Returns a slice of elements split into groups. The order of grouped values is determined by the order they occur in collection. The grouping is generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

partitions := lo.PartitionBy([]int{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(x int) string {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        return &quot;negative&quot;
    } else if x%2 == 0 {
        return &quot;even&quot;
    }
    return &quot;odd&quot;
})
// [][]int{{-2, -1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 5}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/NfQ_nGjkgXW)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.PartitionBy()`, but callback is called in goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

partitions := lop.PartitionBy([]int{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(x int) string {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        return &quot;negative&quot;
    } else if x%2 == 0 {
        return &quot;even&quot;
    }
    return &quot;odd&quot;
})
// [][]int{{-2, -1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 5}}
```

### Flatten

Returns a slice a single level deep.

```go
flat := lo.Flatten([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 5}})
// []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/rbp9ORaMpjw)]

### Interleave

Round-robin alternating input slices and sequentially appending value at index into result.

```go
interleaved := lo.Interleave([]int{1, 4, 7}, []int{2, 5, 8}, []int{3, 6, 9})
// []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

interleaved := lo.Interleave([]int{1}, []int{2, 5, 8}, []int{3, 6}, []int{4, 7, 9, 10})
// []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```

### Shuffle

Returns a slice of shuffled values. Uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.

⚠️ This helper is **mutable**.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
lom.Shuffle(list)

list
// []int{1, 4, 0, 3, 5, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/2xb3WdLjeSJ)]

### Reverse

Reverses a slice so that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second to last, and so on.

⚠️ This helper is **mutable**.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
lom.Reverse(list)

list
// []int{5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/O-M5pmCRgzV)]

### Fill

Fills elements of a slice with `initial` value.

```go
type foo struct {
  bar string
}

func (f foo) Clone() foo {
  return foo{f.bar}
}

initializedSlice := lo.Fill([]foo{foo{&quot;a&quot;}, foo{&quot;a&quot;}}, foo{&quot;b&quot;})
// []foo{foo{&quot;b&quot;}, foo{&quot;b&quot;}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/VwR34GzqEub)]

### Repeat

Builds a slice with N copies of initial value.

```go
type foo struct {
  bar string
}

func (f foo) Clone() foo {
  return foo{f.bar}
}

slice := lo.Repeat(2, foo{&quot;a&quot;})
// []foo{foo{&quot;a&quot;}, foo{&quot;a&quot;}}
```

## About Kratos
  
&gt; The name is inspired by the Greek-mythology-based game &quot;God of War&quot;. It tells the adventures of Kratos becoming a god of war from a mortal and launching a god-killing slaughter.

Kratos is a microservice-oriented governance framework implemented by golang, which offers convenient capabilities to help you quickly build a bulletproof application from scratch, such as:

- The [communication protocol](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/api) is based on the HTTP/gRPC through the definition of Protobuf.
- Abstract [transport](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/transport/overview) layer support: [HTTP](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/transport/http) / [gRPC](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/transport/grpc).
- Powerful [middleware](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/overview) design, support: [Tracing (OpenTelemetry)](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/tracing), [Metrics (Prometheus is default)](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/metrics), [Recovery](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/recovery) and more.
- [Registry](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/registry) interface able to be connected with various other centralized registries through plug-ins.
- The [standard log interfaces](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/log) ease the integration of the third-party log libs with logs collected through the *Fluentd*.
- Automatically support the selection of the content [encoding](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/encoding) with Accept and Content-Type.
- Multiple data sources are supported for [configurations](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/config) and dynamic configurations (use atomic operations).
- In the protocol of HTTP/gRPC, use the uniform [metadata](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/metadata) transfer method.
- You can define [errors](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/errors/) in protos and generate enums with protoc-gen-go.
- You can define [verification rules](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/validate) in Protobuf supported by the HTTP/gRPC service.
- [Swagger API](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/guide/openapi) is generated Automatically and embed Swagger UI endpoint can be started by adding [Swagger plugin](https://github.com/go-kratos/swagger-api).

Kratos is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Kratos

Kratos has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/getting-started/start) and [example](https://github.com/go-kratos/examples) library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

We also provide a [modern template](https://github.com/go-kratos/kratos-layout). This template should help reduce the work required to set up modern projects.

### Goals

Kratos boosts your productivity. With the integration of excellent resources and further support, programmers can get rid of most issues might encounter in the field of distributed systems and software engineering such that they are allowed to focus on the release of businesses only. Additionally, for each programmer, Kratos is also an ideal one learning warehouse for many aspects of microservices to enrich their experiences and skills.

### Principles

* **Simple**: Appropriate design with plain and easy code.
* **General**: Cover the various utilities for business development.
* **Highly efficient**: Speeding up the efficiency of businesses upgrading.
* **Stable**: The base libs validated in the production environment have the characteristics of high testability, high coverage as well as high security and reliability.
* **Robust**: Eliminating misusing through high quality of the base libs.
* **High-performance**: Optimal performance excluding the optimization of hacking in case of *unsafe*. 
* **Expandability**: Properly designed interfaces where you can expand utilities such as base libs to meet your further requirements.
* **Fault-tolerance**: Designed against failure, enhance the understanding and exercising of SRE within Kratos to achieve more robustness.
* **Toolchain**: Includes an extensive toolchain, such as the code generation of cache, the lint tool, and so forth.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

- Find and use [popular software packaged as Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) to run in Kubernetes
- Share your own applications as Helm Charts
- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
- Manage releases of Helm packages

## Helm in a Handbasket

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Helm Development and Stable Versions

Helm v4 is currently under development on the `main` branch. This is unstable and the APIs within the Go SDK and at the command line are changing.
Helm v3 (current stable) is maintained on the `dev-v3` branch. APIs there follow semantic versioning.

## Install

Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest).

Unpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!

If you want to use a package manager:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install helm`.
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) users can use `choco install kubernetes-helm`.
- [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) users can use `winget install Helm.Helm`.
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) users can use `scoop install helm`.
- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) users can use `snap install helm --classic`.
- [Flox](https://flox.dev) users can use `flox install kubernetes-helm`.

To rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the [Quick Start Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/).

See the [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more options,
including installing pre-releases.

## Docs

Get started with the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://helm.sh/docs).

## Roadmap

The [Helm roadmap uses GitHub milestones](https://github.com/helm/helm/milestones) to track the progress of the project.

The development of Helm v4 is currently happening on the `main` branch while the development of Helm v3, the stable branch, is happening on the `dev-v3` branch. Changes should be made to the `main` branch prior to being added to the `dev-v3` branch so that all changes are carried along to Helm v4.

## Community, discussion, contribution, and support

You can reach the Helm community and developers via the following channels:

- [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):
  - [#helm-users](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/helm-users)

            <h2>README</h2><pre># 🐳 Official Docker MCP Registry

Welcome to the Official Docker MCP (Model Context Protocol) Registry! This repository serves as a curated catalog of MCP servers that can be easily discovered, deployed, and integrated with any MCP Client and compatible with Docker tooling. 

Entries in this catalog will be available at: 
- [MCP catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp) 
- [Docker Desktop&#039;s MCP Toolkit](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 
- [Docker Hub `mcp` namespace](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp) (for MCP servers built by Docker)

## 🤖 What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect with external data sources and tools. Read more at [MCP Official Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## ✨ Why Use the Docker MCP Registry?
- **Enterprise Security**: MCP servers built by Docker include cryptographic signatures, provenance tracking, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) for maximum trust and compliance
- **Container Isolation**: All MCP servers run in isolated containers, protecting your host system from potential security vulnerabilities
- **Curated Quality**: All MCP servers undergo review to ensure they meet quality and security standards
- **Easy Discovery**: Browse and find MCP servers for your specific use cases or share yours to millions of developers using Docker tools
- **Docker Integration**: Seamless deployment with Docker containers

## 🤝 Contributing to the Docker MCP Registry
We welcome contributions to the Official Docker MCP Registry! If you&#039;d like to contribute, you can submit a PR with the metadata information and it will be added to the [MCP catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp), to [Docker Desktop&#039;s MCP Toolkit](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), and (for MCP servers images built by Docker) in `mcp` namespace in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp).

To add your MCP server to the registry, please review the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for detailed instructions. We support two types of submissions:

### 🏗️ Option A: Docker-Built Image (Recommended)
Have Docker build and maintain your server image with enhanced security features. You&#039;ll submit the required information via pull request and upon approval Docker will build, sign, and publish your image to mcp/your-server-name on Docker Hub and the catalog entry will be available in the catalog in 24 hours.

_**Benefits: Your image will include cryptographic signatures, provenance tracking, SBOMs, and automatic security updates**_

### 📦 Option B: Self-Provided Pre-Built Image
In this option, you&#039;ll provide an already built image which will be used directly in the catalog. 

_**Note: Self-built images still benefit from container isolation but won&#039;t include the enhanced security features of Docker-built images.**_

## ✏️ Modifying or Removing Servers
To request modifications or removal of an existing MCP Server please open an issue explaining the reason for the edit/removal.

## ✅ Compliance and Quality Standards
All MCP servers in this registry must:
- Follow security best practices
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Provide working Docker deployment
- Maintain compatibility with MCP standards
- Include proper error handling and logging

_**Non-compliant servers will be reviewed and may be removed from the registry.**_

## 🔨 Installation

For binary builds, Docker images, RPM &amp; DEB packages, and other builds of
Telegraf, please see the [install guide](/docs/INSTALL_GUIDE.md).

See the [releases documentation](/docs/RELEASES.md) for details on versioning
and when releases are made.

## 💻 Usage

Users define a TOML configuration with the plugins and settings they wish to
use, then pass that configuration to Telegraf. The Telegraf agent then
collects data from inputs at each interval and sends data to outputs at each
flush interval.

For a basic walkthrough see [quick start](/docs/QUICK_START.md).

## 📖 Documentation

For a full list of documentation including tutorials, reference and other
material, start with the [/docs directory](/docs/README.md).

Additionally, each plugin has its own README that includes details about how to
configure, use, and sometimes debug or troubleshoot. Look under the
[/plugins directory](/plugins/) for specific plugins.

  &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

## Key Features

- **[Distributed Transactions](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/distributed-transactions-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB uses a two-phase commit protocol to ensure ACID compliance, providing strong consistency. Transactions span multiple nodes, and TiDB&#039;s distributed nature ensures data correctness even in the presence of network partitions or node failures.

- **[Horizontal and Vertical Scalability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/scale-tidb-using-tiup?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes or vertically by increasing resources of existing nodes, all without downtime. TiDB&#039;s architecture separates computing from storage, enabling you to adjust both independently as needed for flexibility and growth.

- **[High Availability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/high-availability-with-multi-az?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Built-in Raft consensus protocol ensures reliability and automated failover. Data is stored in multiple replicas, and transactions are committed only after writing to the majority of replicas, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability, even if some replicas fail. Geographic placement of replicas can be configured for different disaster tolerance levels.

- **[Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP)](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/htap-demystified-defining-modern-data-architecture-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB provides two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. The TiDB Server coordinates query execution across both TiKV and TiFlash to optimize performance.

- **[Cloud-Native](https://www.pingcap.com/cloud-native?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be deployed in public clouds, on-premises, or natively in Kubernetes. [TiDB Operator](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) helps manage TiDB on Kubernetes, automating cluster operations, while [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) provides a fully-managed service for easy and economical deployment, allowing users to set up clusters with just a few clicks.

- **[MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/mysql-compatibility?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB is compatible with MySQL 8.0, allowing you to use familiar protocols, frameworks and tools. You can migrate applications to TiDB without changing any code, or with minimal modifications. Additionally, TiDB provides a suite of [data migration tools](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/ecosystem-tool-user-guide?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) to help easily migrate application data into TiDB.

- **[Open Source Commitment](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/open-source-is-in-our-dna-reaffirming-tidb-commitment?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Open source is at the core of TiDB&#039;s identity. All source code is available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license, including enterprise-grade features. TiDB is built with the belief that open source enables transparency, innovation, and collaboration. We actively encourage contributions from the community to help build a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem, reaffirming our commitment to open development and accessibility for everyone.

Karpenter is an open-source node provisioning project built for Kubernetes.
Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by:

* **Watching** for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable
* **Evaluating** scheduling constraints (resource requests, nodeselectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints) requested by the pods
* **Provisioning** nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
* **Removing** the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed

Come discuss Karpenter in the [#karpenter](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C02SFFZSA2K) channel, in the [Kubernetes slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) or join the [Karpenter working group](https://karpenter.sh/docs/contributing/community-meetings/#working-group-meetings) bi-weekly calls. If you want to contribute to the Karpenter project, please refer to the Karpenter docs.

Check out the [Docs](https://karpenter.sh/docs/) to learn more.
