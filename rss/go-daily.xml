## Open architecture
The Flexprice core (metering, credits, pricing, billing) has an open and composable design. 

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;./assets/open-arch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;open architechture&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Your application, whether it&#039;s running backend APIs, AI agents, or custom workflows, can send usage data to Flexprice. You can directly stream data from data warehouses or analytics pipelines as well.

At the core, Flexprice processes this data in real time. We handle everything that usually ends up as custom logic built by developers. Our platform calculates pricing based on the customer‚Äôs plan, applies any prepaid or promotional credits, enforces feature limits, and generates accurate invoices automatically. Whether you&#039;re using seat-based subscriptions, usage-based pricing, or prepaid credit bundles, you can set up and iterate on your pricing model without writing billing infrastructure from scratch.

After billing is computed, our platform connects to your existing tools for payments, CPQ, CRM, and accounting, ensuring billing information flows into the systems your business already uses. It can sync invoices to your payment processor, update customer data in your CRM, and push revenue numbers to your accounting tools.

With this architecture, you get full control over how billing works inside your product, while saving your team from the complexity of maintaining it all.

## Why billing is a developer problem?

##### TL;DR
*When existing billing tools don‚Äôt flex to your product‚Äôs needs, developers shoulder the burden eating up valuable development time and causing ongoing maintenance headaches.*

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;./assets/struggle.png&quot; alt=&quot;struggle is real&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Modern app developers often find themselves wrestling with billing systems. Here are some of the biggest pain points that turn billing into a ‚Äúdeveloper problem‚Äù:

- **Rigid billing tools (lack of flexibility):** Traditional billing services handle simple subscriptions or payments, but anything beyond that ‚Äì usage metering, credit systems, feature gating, custom invoice logic ‚Äì usually isn‚Äôt supported out of the box. Developers end up writing countless workarounds or custom code to accommodate these needs. In other words, if your pricing model doesn‚Äôt fit the tool, you‚Äôre stuck bending your product or building logic from scratch.

- **Complex usage metering at scale:** Implementing accurate usage tracking is hard. It involves capturing high-volume events, aggregating them in real time, handling edge cases (prorations, time zones, etc.), and ensuring it all works reliably at scale. Few teams anticipate how many moving parts this requires until they‚Äôre deep in the weeds of building it.

- **Vendor lock-in and black boxes:** Relying on third-party billing platforms can mean surrendering flexibility. Many SaaS billing providers are closed systems or charge a percentage fee on revenue, which frustrates engineers who want full control over their pricing logic and data. Changing providers later can be a massive undertaking, so teams feel ‚Äústuck‚Äù with a less-than-ideal solution.

- **Delayed monetization &amp; opportunity cost:** Every week spent building or patching a billing system is a week not spent on core product features. If it takes months to implement a new pricing model or usage-based feature, that‚Äôs delayed revenue and lost agility for the business. What might be scoped as a ‚Äúquick two-month project‚Äù can quickly spiral into a multi-year maintenance headache, tying up engineering resources and slowing time-to-market for new offerings.

## How Flexprice solves this

Flexprice‚Äôs approach is to abstract away the hard parts of billing while preserving maximum flexibility and transparency for developers. It addresses the above pain points in several key ways:

- **Developer-first design:** Flexprice is built API-first with easy integrations. You can instrument your app by simply sending usage events via SDKs, and Flexprice handles the aggregation, metering, and billing logic in real time. This means minimal code to write on your end and no need to reinvent metering or invoice calculations.

* **Open-source and self-hostable:** Flexprice is open-source, so you can run it on your own infrastructure for full transparency and control. There‚Äôs no black-box dependency or surprise fees and you‚Äôre free from vendor lock-in. You can inspect the code, extend functionality, and trust that your billing logic is fully in your hands.
    
    
- **Composable with your stack:** Rather than replacing your existing billing or payment provider, Flexprice augments it. You can build it from scratch or build on top of your existing billing providers like Stripe or Chargebee to manage usage data, pricing rules, credits, and entitlements. You can easily integrate with your existing payment gateways, CRM, CPQ, etc. This layered approach preserves your current workflows and customer touchpoints.
    
    
* **Flexible pricing models out-of-the-box:** Whether you need pure usage-based billing, tiered plans, seat-based subscriptions, prepaid credits, free tiers with overage, or any hybrid model, Flexprice‚Äôs data model and rules engine can support it. Flexprice is designed to accommodate changing pricing strategies in minutues that would normally require schema updates and migration scripts.

- **Transparency and visibility:** Because Flexprice meters every event and ties it to billing, you (and your customers) get clear visibility into usage and charges. It can provide real-time usage summaries and cost reports, helping both engineering and finance teams ensure everything lines up correctly. Customers get detailed invoices that show exactly what they‚Äôre paying for, reducing billing disputes or confusion.

By handling the heavy lifting from real-time usage tracking to invoice generation, Flexprice lets your team focus on building your actual product, not the billing system around it

## **Features**

Flexprice provides a rich set of features to power usage-based and hybrid billing models. Key features include:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;./assets/features.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;features&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

*  [**Usage Metering:**](https://docs.flexprice.io/api-reference/events/get-raw-events) Define custom usage events (API calls, compute time, database queries, etc.) at a granular level and track them in real time. Flexprice‚Äôs metering system can handle millions of events and aggregates usage data reliably, even at peak load. This ensures your billing is always up-to-date with actual customer usage.
- [**Credit Grants (Prepaid &amp; Promotional Credits):**](https://docs.flexprice.io/docs/Wallet/Creating%20a%20wallet) Support credit-based workflows with full control. You can grant prepaid credits or promotional credits to customers, set up automatic top-ups at thresholds, and expire unused credits as needed. Flexprice‚Äôs credit system is built-in, so you don‚Äôt need extra custom logic to handle one-time credits or wallets.
* [**Pricing Plans:**](https://docs.flexprice.io/docs/Product%20catalogue/Plans/Overview) Design and iterate on pricing models with total flexibility ‚Äì whether seat-based subscriptions, pure pay-as-you-go, volume-tiered pricing, or hybrids. You can launch new plans or modify existing ones (e.g. special pricing for a particular customer) without additional engineering effort. Flexprice lets you override plan settings per customer and manage plan versioning over time, making it easy to evolve pricing as your product and market strategy change.
- [**Feature Management:**](https://docs.flexprice.io/docs/Product%20catalogue/Features/Overview) Manage feature entitlements and usage limits per plan or per customer. Flexprice lets you define feature toggles (on/off), metered feature limits, or configuration values tied to plans. You can enforce usage limits in your application by checking with Flexprice (for example, limit API calls per month or enable/disable certain features based on plan) without building complex entitlement logic yourself. This ensures that your product‚Äôs feature access is always in sync with what the customer has paid for.
* [**Subscriptions &amp; Invoicing:**](https://docs.flexprice.io/docs/Invoices/Overview) Flexprice generates clear, accurate invoices based on real-time usage data, subscriptions, and credits. It automates billing cycles ‚Äì handling proration, overages, and credit application ‚Äì and produces invoice line items that give customers full visibility into their charges. Finance teams can easily reconcile billing because every charge is linked to tracked usage or a defined price. You can also integrate this with your payment processor to automate charging customers once an invoice is finalized.

Each of these features is accessible via Flexprice‚Äôs APIs and dashboard, allowing you to mix and match to build the exact billing experience you need.

## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you‚Äôve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

Organize your photos &amp; videos, chats &amp; messages, location history, social media content, contacts, and more into a single cohesive timeline on your own computer where you can keep them alive and own them forever.

Timelinize lets you import your data from practically anywhere: your computer, phone, online accounts, GPS-enabled radios, various apps and programs, contact lists, cameras, and more.

**[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/C9dCnTW6qV)** to discuss!


&gt; [!TIP]  
&gt; Screenshots and videos here portray real timelines containing real data in **demo mode**, which obfuscates the sensitive information. Images are blurred, names and other identifiers are replaced with random data, and some locations are faked. Your timeline will show the real data.

## Screenshots

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; The UI is still evolving, so these screenshots are outdated, but they give you the idea.

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
![WIP Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293cbe57-ac75-4c4b-b78a-b75f6d442d99) WIP dashboard. **Very** WIP. The bubble chart is particularly interesting as it shows you what kinds of data are most common at which times of day throughout the years. | ![Timeline view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f808c4-7b0e-4ad0-b12a-6398f6321272) The classic timeline view is a combination of all data grouped by types and time segments for reconstructing a day or other custom time period.
![Item view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f5671c-df85-4af5-9f67-6358e7489442) Viewing an item shows all the information about it, regardless of type: text, photo, live photo, video, location, etc. | ![File picker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf2482e-58a5-434f-a0d2-f9b1274af106) I had to make a custom file picker since browser APIs are too limiting. This is how you&#039;ll import most of your data into your timeline, but this flow is being revised soon.
![3D map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051031c1-0659-4388-b01f-475bb4d24490) The large map view is capable of 3D exploration, showing your memories right where they happened with a color-coded path that represents time. | ![Map showing non-geolocated data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ddbe3cd-4bdc-4d3a-be92-d9c41e29ee1b) Because Timelinize is entity-aware and supports multiple data sources, it can show data on a map even if it doesn&#039;t have geolocation information. That&#039;s what the gray dots or pins represent. In this example, a text message was received while at church, even though it doesn&#039;t have any geolocation info associated with it directly.
![Entities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832c6bce-029c-4abf-943e-84253458a9f7) Timelinize treats entities (people, pets/animals, organizations, etc.) as first-class data points which you can filter and organize. | ![Merge entities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932259b1-fc1d-40bc-b27d-a58e37537c4c) Timelinize will automatically recognize the same entity across data sources with enough information, but if it isn&#039;t possible automatically, you can manually merge entities with a click.
![Conversations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0973df3c-eba9-49b8-b369-0e44f4120c37) Conversations are aggregated across data sources that have messaging capabilities. They become emergent from the database by querying relationships between items and entities. | ![Conversation view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ece383-6702-47ed-8f11-6c95af0cc3de) In this conversation view, you can see messages exchanged with this person across both Facebook and SMS/text message are displayed together. Reactions are also supported.
![Gallery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe89db8e-66b1-4854-9d47-a774bf20961f) A gallery displays photos and videos, but not just those in your photo library: it includes pictures and memes sent via messages, photos and videos uploaded to social media, and any other photos/videos in your data. You can always filter to drill down.


## How it works

1. **[Obtain your data.](https://timelinize.com/docs/data-preparation)** This usually involves exporting your data from apps, online accounts, or devices. For example, requesting an archive from Google Takeout. (Apple iCloud, Facebook, Twitter/X, Strava, Instagram, etc. all offer similar functionality for GDPR compliance.) Do this early/soon, because some services take days to provide your data.
2. **Import your data using Timelinize.** You don&#039;t need to extract or decompress .tar or .zip archives; Timelinize will attempt to recognize your data in its original format and folder structure. All the data you import is indexed in a SQLite database and stored on disk organized by date -- no obfuscation or proprietary formats; you can simply browse your files if you wish.
3. **Explore and organize!** Timelinize has a UI that portrays data using various projections and filters. It can recall moments from your past and help you view your life more comprehensively. (It&#039;s a great living family history tool.)
4. **Repeat steps 1-3 as often as desired.** Timelinize will skip any existing data that is the same and only import new content. You could do this every few weeks or months for busy accounts that are most important to you.

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Timelinize is in active development and is still  unstable. The schema is still changing, necessitating starting over from a clean slate when updating. Always keep your original source data. Expect to delete and recreate your timelines as you upgrade to new versions/builds.

## Download and run

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/releases/latest) for your platform.

See the website for [installation instructions](https://timelinize.com/docs/install).

## Develop

See our [project wiki](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/) for instructions on [compiling from source](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/Develop).


## Command line interface

Timelinize has a symmetric HTTP API and CLI. When an HTTP API endpoint is created in the code, it automatically adds to the command line as well.

Run `timelinize help` (or `go run main.go help` if you&#039;re running from source) to view the list of commands, which are also HTTP endpoints. JSON or form inputs are converted to command line args/flags that represent the JSON schema or form fields.

&lt;summary&gt;Wails UI info (no longer used)&lt;/summary&gt;

## Wails v2 (native GUI) info

The last commit that used Wails (v2) was b9b80838b2b92501139f2f0c5fab63921a7e6502.
That can be used as a reference if we ever switch back to Wails. The last working
commit that had Wails that was released as a dev preview was
bcb0f732e01e5b0e34a142a35b658a1f328c4c6d.

In July-August 2023 we transitioned away from Wails and went to a client/server
model for stability and flexibility. Wails itself was great, the main problem
was the poor performance of Webkit2GTK, even on Mac it was pretty bad (frequent
crashes).

The instructions below are preserved here for reference in case that comes
in handy, though the commits above also have this in their READMEs:

### Development

Run commands in the project root:

#### Linux, macOS

```bash
$ wails dev
```

#### Windows

```powershell
$env:CC=&quot;zig cc&quot;; $env:CXX=&quot;zig c++&quot;; wails dev
```

Or, if cross-compiling:

```powershell
&gt; $env:CC=&quot;zig cc -target x86_64-windows&quot;; $env:CXX=&quot;zig c++ -target x86_64-windows&quot;; wails dev
```

&lt;/details&gt; --&gt;

## Setup Development Environment
Dev Container setup is provided for easy development using GitHub Codespaces or Visual Studio Code with the DevContainers extension.

### Getting started with VSCode
1. Make sure you have the following installed:

	- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
	- [DevContainers for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. Open this project in VSCode
3. Go to the __Remote Explorer__ on Activity Bar
4. Click on __New Dev Container (+)__
5. Click on __Open Current Folder in Container__

This sets up a docker container with all the dependencies required for building this project. You can get started with contributing quickly.


## Motivation and vision

(For roadmap, see [issues tagged `long-term üî≠`](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22long-term%20%F0%9F%94%AD%22).)

The motivation for this project is two-fold. Both press upon me with a sense of urgency, which is why I dedicated some nights and weekends to work on this.

1. Connecting with my family -- both living and deceased -- is important to me and my close relatives. But I wish we had more insights into the lives of those who came before us. What was important to them? Where did they live / travel / spend their time? What lessons did they learn? How did global and local events -- or heck, even the weather -- affect them? What hardships did they endure? What would they have wanted to remember? What would it be like to talk to them? A lot of this could not be known unless they wrote it all down. But these days, we have that data for ourselves. What better time than right now to start collecting personal histories from all available sources and develop a rich timeline of our life for our family, or even just for our own reference and nostalgia.

2. Our lives are better-documented than any before us, but the record of our life is more ephemeral than any before us, too. We lose control of our data by relying on centralized, proprietary apps and cloud services which are useful today, and gone tomorrow. I wrote Timelinize because now is the time to liberate my data from corporations who don&#039;t own it, yet who have the only copy of it. This reality has made me feel uneasy for years, and it&#039;s not going away soon. Timelinize makes it bearable.

Imagine being able to pull up a single screen with your data from any and all of your online accounts and services -- while offline. And there you see so many aspects of your life at a glance: your photos and videos, social media posts, locations on a map and how you got there, emails and letters, documents, health and physical activities, mental and emotional wellness, and maybe even music you listened to, for any given day. You can &quot;zoom out&quot; and get the big picture. Machine learning algorithms could suggest major clusters based on your content to summarize your days, months, or years, and from that, even recommend printing physical memorabilia. It&#039;s like a highly-detailed, automated journal, fully in your control, which you can add to in the app: augment it with your own thoughts like a regular journal.

Then cross-reference your own timeline with a global public timeline: see how locations you went to changed over time, or what major news events may have affected you, or what the political/social climate -- or the literal climate -- was like at the time. For example, you may wonder, &quot;Why did the family stay inside so much of the summer one year?&quot; You could then see, &quot;Oh, because it was 110 F (43 C) degrees for two months straight.&quot;

Or translate the projection sideways, and instead of looking at time cross-sections, look at cross-sections of your timeline by media type: photos, posts, location, sentiment. Look at plots, charts, graphs, of your physical activity.

Or view projections by space instead of time: view interrelations between items on a map, even items that don&#039;t have location data, because the database is entity-aware. So if a person receives a text message and the same person has location information at about the same time from a photo or GPS device, then the text message can appear on a map too, reminding you where you first got the text with the news about your nephew&#039;s birth.

And all of this runs on your own computer: no one else has access to it, no one else owns it, but you.

And if everyone had their own timeline, in theory they could be merged into a global supertimeline to become a thorough record of the human race, all without the need for centralizing our data on cloud services that are controlled by greedy corporations.

## History

I&#039;ve been working on this project since about 2013, even before I conceptualized [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com). My initial vision was to create an automated backup of my Picasa albums that I could store on my own hard drive. This project was called Photobak. Picasa eventually became Google Photos, and about the same time I realized I wanted to backup my photos posted to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, too. And while I was at it, why not include my Google Location History to augment the location data from the photos. The vision continued to expand as I realized that my family could use this too, so the schema was upgraded to support multiple people/entities as well. This could allow us to merge databases, or timelines, as family members pass, or as they share parts of their timeline around with each other. Timelinize is the mature evolution of the original project that is now designed to be a comprehensive, highly detailed archive of one&#039;s life through digital (or _digitized_) content. An authoritative, unified record that is easy to preserve and organize.

## License

This project is licensed with AGPL. I chose this license because I do not want others, especially companies, to make proprietary or commercial software using this package. The point of this project is liberation of and control over one&#039;s own personal data, and I want to ensure that this project won&#039;t perpetuate or exacerbate the walled garden problem we already face today. Even if the future of this project ever has proprietary source code, I can ensure it will stay aligned with my values and the project&#039;s original goals.

## What is Higress?

Higress is a cloud-native API gateway based on Istio and Envoy, which can be extended with Wasm plugins written in Go/Rust/JS. It provides dozens of ready-to-use general-purpose plugins and an out-of-the-box console (try the [demo here](http://demo.higress.io/)).

### Core Use Cases

Higress&#039;s AI gateway capabilities support all [mainstream model providers](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/tree/main/plugins/wasm-go/extensions/ai-proxy/provider) both domestic and international. It also supports hosting MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers through its plugin mechanism, enabling AI Agents to easily call various tools and services. With the [openapi-to-mcp tool](https://github.com/higress-group/openapi-to-mcpserver), you can quickly convert OpenAPI specifications into remote MCP servers for hosting. Higress provides unified management for both LLM API and MCP API. 

**üåü Try it now at [https://mcp.higress.ai/](https://mcp.higress.ai/)** to experience Higress-hosted Remote MCP Servers firsthand:

### Enterprise Adoption

Higress was born within Alibaba to solve the issues of Tengine reload affecting long-connection services and insufficient load balancing capabilities for gRPC/Dubbo. Within Alibaba Cloud, Higress&#039;s AI gateway capabilities support core AI applications such as Tongyi Bailian model studio, machine learning PAI platform, and other critical AI services. Alibaba Cloud has built its cloud-native API gateway product based on Higress, providing 99.99% gateway high availability guarantee service capabilities for a large number of enterprise customers.

Higress can be started with just Docker, making it convenient for individual developers to set up locally for learning or for building simple sites:

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir higress; cd higress
# Start higress, configuration files will be written to the working directory
docker run -d --rm --name higress-ai -v ${PWD}:/data \
        -p 8001:8001 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443  \
        higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/higress/all-in-one:latest
```

Port descriptions:

- Port 8001: Higress UI console entry
- Port 8080: Gateway HTTP protocol entry
- Port 8443: Gateway HTTPS protocol entry

&gt; All Higress Docker images use Higress&#039;s own image repository and are not affected by Docker Hub rate limits.
&gt; In addition, the submission and updates of the images are protected by a security scanning mechanism (powered by Alibaba Cloud ACR), making them very secure for use in production environments.
&gt; 
&gt; If you experience a timeout when pulling image from `higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com`, you can try replacing it with the following docker registry mirror source:
&gt; 
&gt; **Southeast Asia**: `higress-registry.ap-southeast-7.cr.aliyuncs.com`

For other installation methods such as Helm deployment under K8s, please refer to the official [Quick Start documentation](https://higress.io/en-us/docs/user/quickstart).

## Use Cases

## Project-HAMi: Heterogeneous AI Computing Virtualization Middleware

## Introduction

HAMi, formerly known as &#039;k8s-vGPU-scheduler&#039;, is a Heterogeneous device management middleware for Kubernetes. It can manage different types of heterogeneous devices (like GPU, NPU, etc.), share heterogeneous devices among pods, make better scheduling decisions based on topology of devices and scheduling policies.

It aims to remove the gap between different Heterogeneous devices, and provide a unified interface for users to manage with no changes to their applications. As of December 2024, HAMi has been widely used not only in Internet, public cloud and private cloud, but also broadly adopted in various vertical industries including finance, securities, energy, telecommunications, education, and manufacturing. More than 50 companies or institutions are not only end users but also active contributors. 

![cncf_logo](imgs/cncf-logo.png)

HAMi is a sandbox and [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?item=orchestration-management--scheduling-orchestration--hami) project of  
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/)(CNCF), 
[CNAI Landscape project](https://landscape.cncf.io/?group=cnai&amp;item=cnai--general-orchestration--hami).


## Device virtualization

HAMi provides device virtualization for several heterogeneous devices including GPU, by supporting device sharing and device resource isolation. For the list of devices supporting device virtualization, see [supported devices](#supported-devices)

### Device sharing

- Allows partial device allocation by specifying device core usage.
- Allows partial device allocation by specifying device memory.
- Imposes a hard limit on streaming multiprocessors.
- Requires zero changes to existing programs.
- Support [dynamic-mig](docs/dynamic-mig-support.md) feature, [example](examples/nvidia/dynamic_mig_example.yaml)

&lt;img src=&quot;./imgs/example.png&quot; width = &quot;500&quot; /&gt; 

### Device Resources Isolation

A simple demonstration of device isolation:
A task with the following resources will see 3000M device memory inside container:

```yaml
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # declare how many physical GPUs the pod needs
          nvidia.com/gpumem: 3000 # identifies 3G GPU memory each physical GPU allocates to the pod
```

![img](./imgs/hard_limit.jpg)

&gt; Note:
1. **After installing HAMi, the value of `nvidia.com/gpu` registered on the node defaults to the number of vGPUs.**
2. **When requesting resources in a pod, `nvidia.com/gpu` refers to the number of physical GPUs required by the current pod.**

### Supported devices

[NVIDIA GPU](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi#preparing-your-gpu-nodes)   
[Cambricon MLU](docs/cambricon-mlu-support.md)   
[HYGON DCU](docs/hygon-dcu-support.md)   
[Iluvatar CoreX GPU](docs/iluvatar-gpu-support.md)

## Architect

&lt;img src=&quot;./imgs/hami-arch.png&quot; width = &quot;600&quot; /&gt; 

HAMi consists of several components, including a unified mutatingwebhook, a unified scheduler extender, different device-plugins and different in-container virtualization technics for each heterogeneous AI devices.

## Quick Start

### Choose your orchestrator

[![kube-scheduler](https://img.shields.io/badge/kube-scheduler-blue)](#prerequisites)
[![volcano-scheduler](https://img.shields.io/badge/volcano-scheduler-orange)](docs/how-to-use-volcano-vgpu.md)

### Prerequisites

The list of prerequisites for running the NVIDIA device plugin is described below:

- NVIDIA drivers &gt;= 440
- nvidia-docker version &gt; 2.0
- default runtime configured as nvidia for containerd/docker/cri-o container runtime
- Kubernetes version &gt;= 1.18
- glibc &gt;= 2.17 &amp; glibc &lt; 2.30
- kernel version &gt;= 3.10
- helm &gt; 3.0

### Install

First, Label your GPU nodes for scheduling with HAMi by adding the label &quot;gpu=on&quot;. Without this label, the nodes cannot be managed by our scheduler.

```
kubectl label nodes {nodeid} gpu=on
```

Add our repo in helm

```
helm repo add hami-charts https://project-hami.github.io/HAMi/
```

Use the following command for deployment:

```
helm install hami hami-charts/hami -n kube-system
```

Customize your installation by adjusting the [configs](docs/config.md).

Verify your installation using the following command:

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

If both `hami-device-plugin` (formerly known as `vgpu-device-plugin`)  and `hami-scheduler` (formerly known as `vgpu-scheduler`)  pods are in the *Running* state, your installation is successful. You can try examples [here](examples/nvidia/default_use.yaml) 

### WebUI

[HAMi-WebUI](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi-WebUI) is available after HAMi v2.4

For installation guide, click [here](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi-WebUI/blob/main/docs/installation/helm/index.md)

### Monitor

Monitoring is automatically enabled after installation. Obtain an overview of cluster information by visiting the following URL:

```
http://{scheduler ip}:{monitorPort}/metrics
```

The default monitorPort is 31993; other values can be set using `--set devicePlugin.service.httpPort` during installation.

Grafana dashboard [example](docs/dashboard.md)

&gt; **Note** The status of a node won&#039;t be collected before you submit a task

## Notes

- If you don&#039;t request vGPUs when using the device plugin with NVIDIA images all the GPUs on the machine may be exposed inside your container
- Currently, A100 MIG can be supported in only &quot;none&quot; and &quot;mixed&quot; modes.
- Tasks with the &quot;nodeName&quot; field cannot be scheduled at the moment; please use &quot;nodeSelector&quot; instead.

## Quick Start

### System Requirements

- Go 1.23+ (for source builds)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite (for database storage)
- Redis (for caching and distributed coordination, optional)

### Method 1: Docker Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d --name gpt-load \
    -p 3001:3001 \
    -e AUTH_KEY=your-secure-key-here \
    -v &quot;$(pwd)/data&quot;:/app/data \
    ghcr.io/tbphp/gpt-load:latest
```

&gt; Please change `your-secure-key-here` to a strong password (never use the default value), then you can log in to the management interface: &lt;http://localhost:3001&gt;

### Method 2: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

**Installation Commands:**

```bash
# Create Directory
mkdir -p gpt-load &amp;&amp; cd gpt-load

# Download configuration files
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbphp/gpt-load/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbphp/gpt-load/refs/heads/main/.env.example

# Edit the .env file and change AUTH_KEY to a strong password. Never use default or simple keys like sk-123456.

# Start services
docker compose up -d
```

Before deployment, you must change the default admin key (AUTH_KEY). A recommended format is: sk-prod-[32-character random string].

The default installation uses the SQLite version, which is suitable for lightweight, single-instance applications.

If you need to install MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis, please uncomment the required services in the `docker-compose.yml` file, configure the corresponding environment variables, and restart.

**Other Commands:**

```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Restart Service
docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d

# Update to latest version
docker compose pull &amp;&amp; docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d
```

After deployment:

- Access Web Management Interface: &lt;http://localhost:3001&gt;
- API Proxy Address: &lt;http://localhost:3001/proxy&gt;

&gt; Use your modified AUTH_KEY to log in to the management interface.

### Method 3: Source Build

Source build requires a locally installed database (SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and Redis (optional).

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/tbphp/gpt-load.git
cd gpt-load
go mod tidy

# Create configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and change AUTH_KEY to a strong password. Never use default or simple keys like sk-123456.
# Modify DATABASE_DSN and REDIS_DSN configurations in .env
# REDIS_DSN is optional; if not configured, memory storage will be enabled

# Run
make run
```

After deployment:

- Access Web Management Interface: &lt;http://localhost:3001&gt;
- API Proxy Address: &lt;http://localhost:3001/proxy&gt;

&gt; Use your modified AUTH_KEY to log in to the management interface.

### Method 4: Cluster Deployment

Cluster deployment requires all nodes to connect to the same MySQL (or PostgreSQL) and Redis, with Redis being mandatory. It&#039;s recommended to use unified distributed MySQL and Redis clusters.

**Deployment Requirements:**

- All nodes must configure identical `AUTH_KEY`, `DATABASE_DSN`, `REDIS_DSN`
- Leader-follower architecture where follower nodes must configure environment variable: `IS_SLAVE=true`

For details, please refer to [Cluster Deployment Documentation](https://www.gpt-load.com/docs/cluster?lang=en)

GPT-Load adopts a dual-layer configuration architecture:

#### 1. Static Configuration (Environment Variables)

- **Characteristics**: Read at application startup, immutable during runtime, requires application restart to take effect
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure configuration such as database connections, server ports, authentication keys, etc.
- **Management**: Set via `.env` files or system environment variables

#### 2. Dynamic Configuration (Hot-Reload)

- **System Settings**: Stored in database, providing unified behavioral standards for the entire application
- **Group Configuration**: Behavior parameters customized for specific groups, can override system settings
- **Configuration Priority**: Group Configuration &gt; System Settings &gt; Environment Configuration
- **Characteristics**: Supports hot-reload, takes effect immediately after modification without application restart

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Static Configuration (Environment Variables)&lt;/summary&gt;

## Data Encryption Migration

GPT-Load supports encrypted storage of API keys. You can enable, disable, or change the encryption key at any time.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;View Data Encryption Migration Details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Migration Scenarios

- **Enable Encryption**: Encrypt plaintext data for storage - Use `--to &lt;new-key&gt;`
- **Disable Encryption**: Decrypt encrypted data to plaintext - Use `--from &lt;current-key&gt;`
- **Change Encryption Key**: Replace the encryption key - Use `--from &lt;current-key&gt; --to &lt;new-key&gt;`

### Operation Steps

#### Docker Compose Deployment

```bash
# 1. Update the image (ensure using the latest version)
docker compose pull

# 2. Stop the service
docker compose down

# 3. Backup the database (strongly recommended)
# Before migration, you must manually backup the database or export your keys to avoid key loss due to operations or exceptions.

# 4. Execute migration command
# Enable encryption (your-32-char-secret-key is your key, recommend using 32+ character random string)
docker compose run --rm gpt-load migrate-keys --to &quot;your-32-char-secret-key&quot;

# Disable encryption
docker compose run --rm gpt-load migrate-keys --from &quot;your-current-key&quot;

# Change encryption key
docker compose run --rm gpt-load migrate-keys --from &quot;old-key&quot; --to &quot;new-32-char-secret-key&quot;

# 5. Update configuration file
# Edit .env file, set ENCRYPTION_KEY to match the --to parameter
# If disabling encryption, remove ENCRYPTION_KEY or set it to empty
vim .env
# Add or modify: ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-char-secret-key

# 6. Restart the service
docker compose up -d
```

#### Source Build Deployment

```bash
# 1. Stop the service
# Stop the running service process (Ctrl+C or kill process)

# 2. Backup the database (strongly recommended)
# Before migration, you must manually backup the database or export your keys to avoid key loss due to operations or exceptions.

# 3. Execute migration command
# Enable encryption
make migrate-keys ARGS=&quot;--to your-32-char-secret-key&quot;

# Disable encryption
make migrate-keys ARGS=&quot;--from your-current-key&quot;

# Change encryption key
make migrate-keys ARGS=&quot;--from old-key --to new-32-char-secret-key&quot;

# 4. Update configuration file
# Edit .env file, set ENCRYPTION_KEY to match the --to parameter
echo &quot;ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-char-secret-key&quot; &gt;&gt; .env

# 5. Restart the service
make run
```

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Reminders**:
- **Once ENCRYPTION_KEY is lost, encrypted data CANNOT be recovered!** Please securely backup this key. Consider using a password manager or secure key management system
- **Service must be stopped** before migration to avoid data inconsistency
- Strongly recommended to **backup the database** in case migration fails and recovery is needed
- Keys should use **32 characters or longer random strings** for security
- Ensure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env` matches the `--to` parameter after migration
- If disabling encryption, remove or clear the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` configuration

### Key Generation Examples

```bash
# Generate secure random key (32 characters)
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d &quot;=+/&quot; | cut -c1-32
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Web Management Interface

            <h2>README</h2><pre>Centrifugo is an open-source scalable real-time messaging server. Centrifugo can instantly deliver messages to application online users connected over supported transports (WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, Server-Sent Events (aka EventSource), GRPC, WebTransport). Centrifugo has the concept of channel subscriptions ‚Äì so it&#039;s a user-facing PUB/SUB server.

Centrifugo is language-agnostic and can be used to build chat apps, live comments, multiplayer games, real-time data visualizations, collaborative tools, etc. in combination with any backend. It is well suited for modern architectures and allows decoupling the business logic from the real-time transport layer.

Several official client SDKs for browser and mobile development wrap the bidirectional protocol. In addition, Centrifugo supports a unidirectional approach for simple use cases with no SDK dependency.

## Why Centrifugo

The core idea of Centrifugo is simple ‚Äì it&#039;s a PUB/SUB server on top of modern real-time transports:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://centrifugal.dev/img/protocol_pub_sub.png?v=2&quot; /&gt;

The hard part is to make this concept production-ready, efficient, flexible and available from different application environments. Centrifugo is a mature solution that already helped many projects with adding real-time features and scale towards many concurrent connections. Centrifugo provides a set of features not available in other open-source solutions in the area:

* Efficient real-time transports: WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, Server-Sent Events, GRPC, WebTransport
* Built-in scalability with Redis (or Redis Cluster, or Redis-compatible storage ‚Äì ex. AWS Elasticache, Valkey, KeyDB, DragonflyDB, etc), or Nats.
* Simple HTTP and GRPC server API to communicate with Centrifugo from the app backend
* Asynchronous PostgreSQL and Kafka consumers to support transactional outbox and CDC patterns

## Credits

- [Xray-core v1.0.0](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was forked from [v2fly-core 9a03cc5](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/commit/9a03cc5c98d04cc28320fcee26dbc236b3291256), and we have made &amp; accumulated a huge number of enhancements over time, check [the release notes for each version](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases).
- For third-party projects used in [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core), check your local or [the latest go.mod](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/blob/main/go.mod).

## One-line Compilation

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED=0
go build -o xray.exe -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Reproducible Releases

Make sure that you are using the same Go version, and remember to set the git commit id (7 bytes):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;all=-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

If you are compiling a 32-bit MIPS/MIPSLE target, use this command instead:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

## What is frp?

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone&#039;s needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh1&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-a.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh2&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-b.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-a.example.com`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-b.example.com`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhostHTTPSPort`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;web&quot;
  type = &quot;http&quot;
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = [&quot;www.example.com&quot;]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;dns&quot;
  type = &quot;udp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  unixPath = &quot;/var/run/docker.sock&quot;
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_static_file&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;static_file&quot;
  localPath = &quot;/tmp/files&quot;
  stripPrefix = &quot;static&quot;
  httpUser = &quot;abc&quot;
  httpPassword = &quot;abc&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `localAddr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_https2http&quot;
  type = &quot;https&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;test.example.com&quot;]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;https2http&quot;
  localAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:80&quot;
  crtPath = &quot;./server.crt&quot;
  keyPath = &quot;./server.key&quot;
  hostHeaderRewrite = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = &quot;frp&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `secretKey` field for the preshared key, and that the `remotePort` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`secretKey` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn&#039;t work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

These configuration files is for reference only. Please do not use this configuration directly to run the program as it may have various issues.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps_full_example.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc_full_example.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go&#039;s standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}&quot;
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = {{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remember to prefix your reference with `.Envs`.

## About Kratos
  
&gt; The name is inspired by the Greek-mythology-based game &quot;God of War&quot;. It tells the adventures of Kratos becoming a god of war from a mortal and launching a god-killing slaughter.

Kratos is a microservice-oriented governance framework implemented by golang, which offers convenient capabilities to help you quickly build a bulletproof application from scratch, such as:

- The [communication protocol](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/api) is based on the HTTP/gRPC through the definition of Protobuf.
- Abstract [transport](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/transport/overview) layer support: [HTTP](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/transport/http) / [gRPC](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/transport/grpc).
- Powerful [middleware](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/overview) design, support: [Tracing (OpenTelemetry)](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/tracing), [Metrics (Prometheus is default)](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/metrics), [Recovery](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/recovery) and more.
- [Registry](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/registry) interface able to be connected with various other centralized registries through plug-ins.
- The [standard log interfaces](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/log) ease the integration of the third-party log libs with logs collected through the *Fluentd*.
- Automatically support the selection of the content [encoding](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/encoding) with Accept and Content-Type.
- Multiple data sources are supported for [configurations](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/config) and dynamic configurations (use atomic operations).
- In the protocol of HTTP/gRPC, use the uniform [metadata](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/metadata) transfer method.
- You can define [errors](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/errors/) in protos and generate enums with protoc-gen-go.
- You can define [verification rules](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/component/middleware/validate) in Protobuf supported by the HTTP/gRPC service.
- [Swagger API](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/guide/openapi) is generated Automatically and embed Swagger UI endpoint can be started by adding [Swagger plugin](https://github.com/go-kratos/swagger-api).

Kratos is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Kratos

Kratos has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://go-kratos.dev/en/docs/getting-started/start) and [example](https://github.com/go-kratos/examples) library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

We also provide a [modern template](https://github.com/go-kratos/kratos-layout). This template should help reduce the work required to set up modern projects.

### Goals

Kratos boosts your productivity. With the integration of excellent resources and further support, programmers can get rid of most issues might encounter in the field of distributed systems and software engineering such that they are allowed to focus on the release of businesses only. Additionally, for each programmer, Kratos is also an ideal one learning warehouse for many aspects of microservices to enrich their experiences and skills.

### Principles

* **Simple**: Appropriate design with plain and easy code.
* **General**: Cover the various utilities for business development.
* **Highly efficient**: Speeding up the efficiency of businesses upgrading.
* **Stable**: The base libs validated in the production environment have the characteristics of high testability, high coverage as well as high security and reliability.
* **Robust**: Eliminating misusing through high quality of the base libs.
* **High-performance**: Optimal performance excluding the optimization of hacking in case of *unsafe*.¬†
* **Expandability**: Properly designed interfaces where you can expand utilities such as base libs to meet your further requirements.
* **Fault-tolerance**: Designed against failure, enhance the understanding and exercising of SRE within Kratos to achieve more robustness.
* **Toolchain**: Includes an extensive toolchain, such as the code generation of cache, the lint tool, and so forth.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## What is Nebula?
Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool with a focus on performance, simplicity and security.
It lets you seamlessly connect computers anywhere in the world. Nebula is portable, and runs on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, and Android.
It can be used to connect a small number of computers, but is also able to connect tens of thousands of computers.

Nebula incorporates a number of existing concepts like encryption, security groups, certificates,
and tunneling.
What makes Nebula different to existing offerings is that it brings all of these ideas together,
resulting in a sum that is greater than its individual parts.

Further documentation can be found [here](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/).

You can read more about Nebula [here](https://medium.com/p/884110a5579).

You can also join the NebulaOSS Slack group [here](https://join.slack.com/t/nebulaoss/shared_invite/zt-39pk4xopc-CUKlGcb5Z39dQ0cK1v7ehA).

## Technical Overview

Nebula is a mutually authenticated peer-to-peer software-defined network based on the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/).
Nebula uses certificates to assert a node&#039;s IP address, name, and membership within user-defined groups.
Nebula&#039;s user-defined groups allow for provider agnostic traffic filtering between nodes.
Discovery nodes (aka lighthouses) allow individual peers to find each other and optionally use UDP hole punching to establish connections from behind most firewalls or NATs.
Users can move data between nodes in any number of cloud service providers, datacenters, and endpoints, without needing to maintain a particular addressing scheme.

Nebula uses Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (`ECDH`) key exchange and `AES-256-GCM` in its default configuration.

Nebula was created to provide a mechanism for groups of hosts to communicate securely, even across the internet, while enabling expressive firewall definitions similar in style to cloud security groups.

## Getting started (quickly)

To set up a Nebula network, you&#039;ll need:

#### 1. The [Nebula binaries](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/releases) or [Distribution Packages](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula#distribution-packages) for your specific platform. Specifically you&#039;ll need `nebula-cert` and the specific nebula binary for each platform you use.

#### 2. (Optional, but you really should..) At least one discovery node with a routable IP address, which we call a lighthouse.

Nebula lighthouses allow nodes to find each other, anywhere in the world. A lighthouse is the only node in a Nebula network whose IP should not change. Running a lighthouse requires very few compute resources, and you can easily use the least expensive option from a cloud hosting provider. If you&#039;re not sure which provider to use, a number of us have used $6/mo [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplets as lighthouses.

Once you have launched an instance, ensure that Nebula udp traffic (default port udp/4242) can reach it over the internet.

#### 3. A Nebula certificate authority, which will be the root of trust for a particular Nebula network.

```sh
./nebula-cert ca -name &quot;Myorganization, Inc&quot;
```

This will create files named `ca.key` and `ca.cert` in the current directory. The `ca.key` file is the most sensitive file you&#039;ll create, because it is the key used to sign the certificates for individual nebula nodes/hosts. Please store this file somewhere safe, preferably with strong encryption.

**Be aware!** By default, certificate authorities have a 1-year lifetime before expiration. See [this guide](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/guides/rotating-certificate-authority/) for details on rotating a CA.

#### 4. Nebula host keys and certificates generated from that certificate authority

This assumes you have four nodes, named lighthouse1, laptop, server1, host3. You can name the nodes any way you&#039;d like, including FQDN. You&#039;ll also need to choose IP addresses and the associated subnet. In this example, we are creating a nebula network that will use 192.168.100.x/24 as its network range. This example also demonstrates nebula groups, which can later be used to define traffic rules in a nebula network.
```sh
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;lighthouse1&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.1/24&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;laptop&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.2/24&quot; -groups &quot;laptop,home,ssh&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;server1&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.9/24&quot; -groups &quot;servers&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;host3&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.10/24&quot;
```

By default, host certificates will expire 1 second before the CA expires. Use the `-duration` flag to specify a shorter lifetime.

#### 5. Configuration files for each host

Download a copy of the nebula [example configuration](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/blob/master/examples/config.yml).

* On the lighthouse node, you&#039;ll need to ensure `am_lighthouse: true` is set.

* On the individual hosts, ensure the lighthouse is defined properly in the `static_host_map` section, and is added to the lighthouse `hosts` section.


#### 6. Copy nebula credentials, configuration, and binaries to each host

For each host, copy the nebula binary to the host, along with `config.yml` from step 5, and the files `ca.crt`, `{host}.crt`, and `{host}.key` from step 4.

**DO NOT COPY `ca.key` TO INDIVIDUAL NODES.**

#### 7. Run nebula on each host

```sh
./nebula -config /path/to/config.yml
```

For more detailed instructions, [find the full documentation here](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/).

## Building Nebula from source

Make sure you have [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed and clone this repo. Change to the nebula directory.

To build nebula for all platforms:
`make all`

To build nebula for a specific platform (ex, Windows):
`make bin-windows`

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for more details on build targets

## Curve P256 and BoringCrypto

The default curve used for cryptographic handshakes and signatures is Curve25519. This is the recommended setting for most users. If your deployment has certain compliance requirements, you have the option of creating your CA using `nebula-cert ca -curve P256` to use NIST Curve P256. The CA will then sign certificates using ECDSA P256, and any hosts using these certificates will use P256 for ECDH handshakes.

In addition, Nebula can be built using the [BoringCrypto GOEXPERIMENT](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.20/src/crypto/internal/boring/README.md) by running either of the following make targets:

```sh
make bin-boringcrypto
make release-boringcrypto
```

This is not the recommended default deployment, but may be useful based on your compliance requirements.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

## üéØ What is Nightingale

Nightingale is an open-source monitoring project that focuses on alerting. Similar to Grafana, Nightingale also connects with various existing data sources. However, while Grafana emphasizes visualization, Nightingale places greater emphasis on the alerting engine, as well as the processing and distribution of alarms.

&gt; The Nightingale project was initially developed and open-sourced by DiDi.inc. On May 11, 2022, it was donated to the Open Source Development Committee of the China Computer Federation (CCF ODC).

![](https://n9e.github.io/img/global/arch-bg.png)

## üí° How Nightingale Works

Many users have already collected metrics and log data. In this case, you can connect your storage repositories (such as VictoriaMetrics, ElasticSearch, etc.) as data sources in Nightingale. This allows you to configure alerting rules and notification rules within Nightingale, enabling the generation and distribution of alarms.

![Nightingale Product Architecture](doc/img/readme/20240221152601.png)

Nightingale itself does not provide monitoring data collection capabilities. We recommend using [Categraf](https://github.com/flashcatcloud/categraf) as the collector, which integrates seamlessly with Nightingale.

[Categraf](https://github.com/flashcatcloud/categraf) can collect monitoring data from operating systems, network devices, various middleware, and databases. It pushes this data to Nightingale via the `Prometheus Remote Write` protocol. Nightingale then stores the monitoring data in a time-series database (such as Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, etc.) and provides alerting and visualization capabilities.

For certain edge data centers with poor network connectivity to the central Nightingale server, we offer a distributed deployment mode for the alerting engine. In this mode, even if the network is disconnected, the alerting functionality remains unaffected.

![Edge Deployment Mode](doc/img/readme/20240222102119.png)

&gt; In the above diagram, Data Center A has a good network with the central data center, so it uses the Nightingale process in the central data center as the alerting engine. Data Center B has a poor network with the central data center, so it deploys `n9e-edge` as the alerting engine to handle alerting for its own data sources.

## üîï Alert Noise Reduction, Escalation, and Collaboration

Nightingale focuses on being an alerting engine, responsible for generating alarms and flexibly distributing them based on rules. It supports 20 built-in notification medias (such as phone calls, SMS, email, DingTalk, Slack, etc.).

If you have more advanced requirements, such as:
- Want to consolidate events from multiple monitoring systems into one platform for unified noise reduction, response handling, and data analysis.
- Want to support personnel scheduling, practice on-call culture, and support alert escalation (to avoid missing alerts) and collaborative handling.

Then Nightingale is not suitable. It is recommended that you choose on-call products such as PagerDuty and FlashDuty. These products are simple and easy to use.

## üó®Ô∏è Communication Channels

- **Report Bugs:** It is highly recommended to submit issues via the [Nightingale GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/ccfos/nightingale/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=kind%2Fbug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml).
- **Documentation:** For more information, we recommend thoroughly browsing the [Nightingale Documentation Site](https://n9e.github.io/).

## üîë Key Features

![Nightingale Alerting rules](doc/img/readme/2025-05-23_18-43-37.png)

- Nightingale supports alerting rules, mute rules, subscription rules, and notification rules. It natively supports 20 types of notification media and allows customization of message templates.  
- It supports event pipelines for Pipeline processing of alarms, facilitating automated integration with in-house systems. For example, it can append metadata to alarms or perform relabeling on events. 
- It introduces the concept of business groups and a permission system to manage various rules in a categorized manner.  
- Many databases and middleware come with built-in alert rules that can be directly imported and used. It also supports direct import of Prometheus alerting rules.  
- It supports alerting self-healing, which automatically triggers a script to execute predefined logic after an alarm is generated‚Äîsuch as cleaning up disk space or capturing the current system state.

![Nightingale Alarm Dashboard](doc/img/readme/2025-05-30_08-49-28.png)

- Nightingale archives historical alarms and supports multi-dimensional query and statistics.  
- It supports flexible aggregation grouping, allowing a clear view of the distribution of alarms across the company.

![Nightingale Integration Center](doc/img/readme/2025-05-23_18-46-06.png)

- Nightingale has built-in metric descriptions, dashboards, and alerting rules for common operating systems, middleware, and databases, which are contributed by the community with varying quality.  
- It directly receives data via multiple protocols such as Remote Write, OpenTSDB, Datadog, and Falcon, integrates with various Agents.  
- It supports data sources like Prometheus, ElasticSearch, Loki, ClickHouse, MySQL, Postgres, allowing alerting based on data from these sources.  
- Nightingale can be easily embedded into internal enterprise systems (e.g. Grafana, CMDB), and even supports configuring menu visibility for these embedded systems.

![Nightingale dashboards](doc/img/readme/2025-05-23_18-49-02.png)

- Nightingale supports dashboard functionality, including common chart types, and comes with pre-built dashboards. The image above is a screenshot of one of these dashboards.  
- If you are already accustomed to Grafana, it is recommended to continue using Grafana for visualization, as Grafana has deeper expertise in this area.  
- For machine-related monitoring data collected by Categraf, it is advisable to use Nightingale&#039;s built-in dashboards for viewing. This is because Categraf&#039;s metric naming follows Telegraf&#039;s convention, which differs from that of Node Exporter.  
- Due to Nightingale&#039;s concept of business groups (where machines can belong to different groups), there may be scenarios where you only want to view machines within the current business group on the dashboard. Thus, Nightingale&#039;s dashboards can be linked with business groups for interactive filtering.
