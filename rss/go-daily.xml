&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Vault Logo&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/f22d202cde2018f9455dec755118a9b84586e082/Vault_PrimaryLogo_Black.png&quot;&gt;

Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.

The key features of Vault are:

* **Secure Secret Storage**: Vault can store arbitrary key/value pairs. Vault encrypts data before writing it to persistent
  storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn&#039;t enough to access
  your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io),
  and more.

* **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some
  systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application
  needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault
  will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After
  creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them
  after the lease is up.

* **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing
  it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and
  developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without
  having to design their own encryption methods.

* **Leasing and Renewal**: Vault associates a **lease** with each secret.
  At the end of the lease, Vault automatically revokes the
  secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.

* **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault
  can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example,
  all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.
  Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the
  case of an intrusion.

Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams
-------------------------------

Documentation is available on the [Vault website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs).

If you&#039;re new to Vault and want to get started with security automation, please
check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/getting-started)
on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault)
to continue your learning.

For examples of how to interact with Vault from inside your application in different programming languages, see the [vault-examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-examples) repo. An out-of-the-box [sample application](https://github.com/hashicorp/hello-vault-go) is also available.

Show off your Vault knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the
[certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/#hashicorp-certified-vault-associate)
for information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/certification)
on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform.

Developing Vault
--------------------

If you wish to work on Vault itself or any of its built-in systems, you&#039;ll
first need [Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.

For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a
[GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), then setting the 
[GOBIN](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables) variable to `$GOPATH/bin`. 
Ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your path as some distributions bundle the old version 
of build tools. 

Next, clone this repository. Vault uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules),
so it is recommended that you clone the repository ***outside*** of the GOPATH.
You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:

```sh
$ make bootstrap
...
```

To compile a development version of Vault, run `make` or `make dev`. This will
put the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make dev
...
$ bin/vault
...
```

To compile a development version of Vault with the UI, run `make static-dist dev-ui`. This will
put the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/vault
...
```

To run tests, type `make test`. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If
this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!

```sh
$ make test
...
```

If you&#039;re developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that
package by specifying the `TEST` variable. For example below, only
`vault` package tests will be run.

```sh
$ make test TEST=./vault
...
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like `could not read Username for &#039;https://github.com&#039;` you may need to adjust your git config like so:

```sh
$ git config --global --add url.&quot;git@github.com:&quot;.insteadOf &quot;https://github.com/&quot;
```


### Importing Vault

This repository publishes two libraries that may be imported by other projects:
`github.com/hashicorp/vault/api` and `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk`.

Note that this repository also contains Vault (the product), and as with most Go
projects, Vault uses Go modules to manage its dependencies. The mechanism to do
that is the [go.mod](./go.mod) file. As it happens, the presence of that file
also makes it theoretically possible to import Vault as a dependency into other
projects. Some other projects have made a practice of doing so in order to take
advantage of testing tooling that was developed for testing Vault itself. This
is not, and has never been, a supported way to use the Vault project. We aren&#039;t 
likely to fix bugs relating to failure to import `github.com/hashicorp/vault` 
into your project.

See also the section &quot;Docker-based tests&quot; below.

### Acceptance Tests

Vault has comprehensive [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)
covering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.

If you&#039;re working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to
verify it is functioning (and also hasn&#039;t broken anything else), we recommend
running the acceptance tests.

**Warning:** The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify *real resources*, which
may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically
possible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,
please run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least,
we recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend
you&#039;re testing.

To run the acceptance tests, invoke `make testacc`:

```sh
$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul
...
```

The `TEST` variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the
backend is. The `TESTARGS` variable is recommended to filter down to a specific
resource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very
long time.

Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for
things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell
you what to set, so it is not documented here.

For more information on Vault Enterprise features, visit the [Vault Enterprise site](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=github-vault-enterprise).

### Docker-based Tests

We have created an experimental new testing mechanism inspired by NewTestCluster.
An example of how to use it:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;hashicorp/vault&quot;, // or &quot;hashicorp/vault-enterprise&quot;
    ImageTag:    &quot;latest&quot;,
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
  
  client := cluster.Nodes()[0].APIClient()
  _, err := client.Logical().Read(&quot;sys/storage/raft/configuration&quot;)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Or for Enterprise:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;hashicorp/vault-enterprise&quot;,
    ImageTag:  &quot;latest&quot;,
	VaultLicense: licenseString, // not a path, the actual license bytes
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

Here is a more realistic example of how we use it in practice.  DefaultOptions uses 
`hashicorp/vault`:`latest` as the repo and tag, but it also looks at the environment
variable VAULT_BINARY. If populated, it will copy the local file referenced by
VAULT_BINARY into the container. This is useful when testing local changes.

Instead of setting the VaultLicense option, you can set the VAULT_LICENSE_CI environment
variable, which is better than committing a license to version control.

Optionally you can set COMMIT_SHA, which will be appended to the image name we
build as a debugging convenience.

```go
func Test_Custom_Build_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

There are a variety of helpers in the `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster`
package, e.g. these tests below will create a pair of 3-node clusters and link them using
PR or DR replication respectively, and fail if the replication state doesn&#039;t become healthy
before the passed context expires.

Again, as written, these depend on having a Vault Enterprise binary locally and the env
var VAULT_BINARY set to point to it, as well as having VAULT_LICENSE_CI set.

```go
func TestStandardPerfReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)
  if err != nil {
      t.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer r.Cleanup()

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
  defer cancel()
  err = r.StandardPerfReplication(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func TestStandardDRReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer r.Cleanup()

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
  defer cancel()
  err = r.StandardDRReplication(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Finally, here&#039;s an example of running an existing OSS docker test with a custom binary:

```bash
$ GOOS=linux make dev
$ VAULT_BINARY=$(pwd)/bin/vault go test -run &#039;TestRaft_Configuration_Docker&#039; ./vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary
ok      github.com/hashicorp/vault/vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary        20.960s
```

&lt;/div&gt;

Prometheus, a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics
from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,
displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

The features that distinguish Prometheus from other metrics and monitoring systems are:

* A **multi-dimensional** data model (time series defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)
* PromQL, a **powerful and flexible query language** to leverage this dimensionality
* No dependency on distributed storage; **single server nodes are autonomous**
* An HTTP **pull model** for time series collection
* **Pushing time series** is supported via an intermediary gateway for batch jobs
* Targets are discovered via **service discovery** or **static configuration**
* Multiple modes of **graphing and dashboarding support**
* Support for hierarchical and horizontal **federation**

## Architecture overview

![Architecture overview](documentation/images/architecture.svg)

## Install

There are various ways of installing Prometheus.

### Precompiled binaries

Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the
[*download* section](https://prometheus.io/download/)
on [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io). Using the latest production release binary
is the recommended way of installing Prometheus.
See the [Installing](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/install/)
chapter in the documentation for all the details.

### Docker images

Docker images are available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/).

You can launch a Prometheus container for trying it out with

```bash
docker run --name prometheus -d -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```

Prometheus will now be reachable at &lt;http://localhost:9090/&gt;.

### Building from source

To build Prometheus from source code, You need:

* Go: Version specified in [go.mod](./go.mod) or greater.
* NodeJS: Version specified in [.nvmrc](./web/ui/.nvmrc) or greater.
* npm: Version 10 or greater (check with `npm --version` and [here](https://www.npmjs.com/)).

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus.git
cd prometheus
```

You can use the `go` tool to build and install the `prometheus`
and `promtool` binaries into your `GOPATH`:

```bash
go install github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/...
prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml
```

*However*, when using `go install` to build Prometheus, Prometheus will expect to be able to
read its web assets from local filesystem directories under `web/ui/static`. In order for
these assets to be found, you will have to run Prometheus from the root of the cloned
repository. Note also that this directory does not include the React UI unless it has been
built explicitly using `make assets` or `make build`.

An example of the above configuration file can be found [here.](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml)

You can also build using `make build`, which will compile in the web assets so that
Prometheus can be run from anywhere:

```bash
make build
./prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml
```

The Makefile provides several targets:

* *build*: build the `prometheus` and `promtool` binaries (includes building and compiling in web assets)
* *test*: run the tests
* *test-short*: run the short tests
* *format*: format the source code
* *vet*: check the source code for common errors
* *assets*: build the React UI

### Service discovery plugins

Prometheus is bundled with many service discovery plugins. You can customize
which service discoveries are included in your build using Go build tags.

To exclude service discoveries when building with `make build`, add the desired
tags to the `.promu.yml` file under `build.tags.all`:

```yaml
build:
    tags:
        all:
            - netgo
            - builtinassets
            - remove_all_sd           # Exclude all optional SDs
            - enable_kubernetes_sd    # Re-enable only kubernetes
```

Then run `make build` as usual. Alternatively, when using `go build` directly:

```bash
go build -tags &quot;remove_all_sd,enable_kubernetes_sd&quot; ./cmd/prometheus
```

Available build tags:
* `remove_all_sd` - Exclude all optional service discoveries (keeps file_sd, static_sd, and http_sd)
* `enable_&lt;name&gt;_sd` - Re-enable a specific SD when using `remove_all_sd`

If you add out-of-tree plugins, which we do not endorse at the moment,
additional steps might be needed to adjust the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. As
always, be extra careful when loading third party code.

### Building the Docker image

You can build a docker image locally with the following commands:

```bash
make promu
promu crossbuild -p linux/amd64
make npm_licenses
make common-docker-amd64
```

The `make docker` target is intended only for use in our CI system and will not
produce a fully working image when run locally.

## Using Prometheus as a Go Library

### Remote Write

We are publishing our Remote Write protobuf independently at
[buf.build](https://buf.build/prometheus/prometheus/assets).

You can use that as a library:

```shell
go get buf.build/gen/go/prometheus/prometheus/protocolbuffers/go@latest
```

This is experimental.

### Prometheus code base

In order to comply with [go mod](https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions) rules,
Prometheus release number do not exactly match Go module releases.

For the
Prometheus v3.y.z releases, we are publishing equivalent v0.3y.z tags. The y in v0.3y.z is always padded to two digits, with a leading zero if needed.

Therefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v3.0.0 as a library could do:

```shell
go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.300.0
```

For the
Prometheus v2.y.z releases, we published the equivalent v0.y.z tags.

Therefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v2.35.0 as a library could do:

```shell
go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.35.0
```

This solution makes it clear that we might break our internal Go APIs between
minor user-facing releases, as [breaking changes are allowed in major version
zero](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

## React UI Development

For more information on building, running, and developing on the React-based UI, see the React app&#039;s [README.md](web/ui/README.md).

## More information

* Godoc documentation is available via [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/prometheus). Due to peculiarities of Go Modules, v3.y.z will be displayed as v0.3y.z (the y in v0.3y.z is always padded to two digits, with a leading zero if needed), while v2.y.z will be displayed as v0.y.z.
* See the [Community page](https://prometheus.io/community) for how to reach the Prometheus developers and users on various communication channels.

[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

---

Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework written in [Go](https://go.dev/). It provides a Martini-like API but with significantly better performance—up to 40 times faster—thanks to [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter). Gin is designed for building REST APIs, web applications, and microservices where speed and developer productivity are essential.

**Why choose Gin?**

Gin combines the simplicity of Express.js-style routing with Go&#039;s performance characteristics, making it ideal for:

- Building high-throughput REST APIs
- Developing microservices that need to handle many concurrent requests
- Creating web applications that require fast response times
- Prototyping web services quickly with minimal boilerplate

**Gin&#039;s key features:**

- **Zero allocation router** - Extremely memory-efficient routing with no heap allocations
- **High performance** - Benchmarks show superior speed compared to other Go web frameworks
- **Middleware support** - Extensible middleware system for authentication, logging, CORS, etc.
- **Crash-free** - Built-in recovery middleware prevents panics from crashing your server
- **JSON validation** - Automatic request/response JSON binding and validation
- **Route grouping** - Organize related routes and apply common middleware
- **Error management** - Centralized error handling and logging
- **Built-in rendering** - Support for JSON, XML, HTML templates, and more
- **Extensible** - Large ecosystem of community middleware and plugins

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go version**: Gin requires [Go](https://go.dev/) version [1.24](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.24.0) or above
- **Basic Go knowledge**: Familiarity with Go syntax and package management is helpful

### Installation

With [Go&#039;s module support](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules), simply import Gin in your code and Go will automatically fetch it during build:

```go
import &quot;github.com/gin-gonic/gin&quot;
```

### Your First Gin Application

Here&#039;s a complete example that demonstrates Gin&#039;s simplicity:

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;log&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/gin-gonic/gin&quot;
)

func main() {
  // Create a Gin router with default middleware (logger and recovery)
  r := gin.Default()

  // Define a simple GET endpoint
  r.GET(&quot;/ping&quot;, func(c *gin.Context) {
    // Return JSON response
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;pong&quot;,
    })
  })

  // Start server on port 8080 (default)
  // Server will listen on 0.0.0.0:8080 (localhost:8080 on Windows)
  if err := r.Run(); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf(&quot;failed to run server: %v&quot;, err)
  }
}
```

**Running the application:**

1. Save the code above as `main.go`
2. Run the application:

   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit [`http://localhost:8080/ping`](http://localhost:8080/ping)
4. You should see: `{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;pong&quot;}`

**What this example demonstrates:**

- Creating a Gin router with default middleware
- Defining HTTP endpoints with simple handler functions
- Returning JSON responses
- Starting an HTTP server

---------------------------------------

## Installation
Simple install the package to your [$GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH &quot;GOPATH&quot;) with the [go tool](https://golang.org/cmd/go/ &quot;go command&quot;) from shell:
```bash
go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```
Make sure [Git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine and in your system&#039;s `PATH`.

## Usage
_Go MySQL Driver_ is an implementation of Go&#039;s `database/sql/driver` interface. You only need to import the driver and can use the full [`database/sql`](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/) API then.

Use `mysql` as `driverName` and a valid [DSN](#dsn-data-source-name)  as `dataSourceName`:

```go
import (
	&quot;database/sql&quot;
	&quot;time&quot;

	_ &quot;github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql&quot;
)

// ...

db, err := sql.Open(&quot;mysql&quot;, &quot;user:password@/dbname&quot;)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// See &quot;Important settings&quot; section.
db.SetConnMaxLifetime(time.Minute * 3)
db.SetMaxOpenConns(10)
db.SetMaxIdleConns(10)
```

[Examples are available in our Wiki](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/wiki/Examples &quot;Go-MySQL-Driver Examples&quot;).

### Important settings

`db.SetConnMaxLifetime()` is required to ensure connections are closed by the driver safely before connection is closed by MySQL server, OS, or other middlewares. Since some middlewares close idle connections by 5 minutes, we recommend timeout shorter than 5 minutes. This setting helps load balancing and changing system variables too.

`db.SetMaxOpenConns()` is highly recommended to limit the number of connection used by the application. There is no recommended limit number because it depends on application and MySQL server.

`db.SetMaxIdleConns()` is recommended to be set same to `db.SetMaxOpenConns()`. When it is smaller than `SetMaxOpenConns()`, connections can be opened and closed much more frequently than you expect. Idle connections can be closed by the `db.SetConnMaxLifetime()`. If you want to close idle connections more rapidly, you can use `db.SetConnMaxIdleTime()` since Go 1.15.


### DSN (Data Source Name)

The Data Source Name has a common format, like e.g. [PEAR DB](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-dsn.php) uses it, but without type-prefix (optional parts marked by squared brackets):
```
[username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/dbname[?param1=value1&amp;...&amp;paramN=valueN]
```

A DSN in its fullest form:
```
username:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param=value
```

Except for the databasename, all values are optional. So the minimal DSN is:
```
/dbname
```

If you do not want to preselect a database, leave `dbname` empty:
```
/
```
This has the same effect as an empty DSN string:
```

```

`dbname` is escaped by [PathEscape()](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#PathEscape) since v1.8.0. If your database name is `dbname/withslash`, it becomes:

```
/dbname%2Fwithslash
```

Alternatively, [Config.FormatDSN](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#Config.FormatDSN) can be used to create a DSN string by filling a struct.

#### Password
Passwords can consist of any character. Escaping is **not** necessary.

#### Protocol
See [net.Dial](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial) for more information which networks are available.
In general you should use a Unix domain socket if available and TCP otherwise for best performance.

#### Address
For TCP and UDP networks, addresses have the form `host[:port]`.
If `port` is omitted, the default port will be used.
If `host` is a literal IPv6 address, it must be enclosed in square brackets.
The functions [net.JoinHostPort](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#JoinHostPort) and [net.SplitHostPort](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#SplitHostPort) manipulate addresses in this form.

For Unix domain sockets the address is the absolute path to the MySQL-Server-socket, e.g. `/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock` or `/tmp/mysql.sock`.

#### Parameters
*Parameters are case-sensitive!*

Notice that any of `true`, `TRUE`, `True` or `1` is accepted to stand for a true boolean value. Not surprisingly, false can be specified as any of: `false`, `FALSE`, `False` or `0`.

##### `allowAllFiles`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

`allowAllFiles=true` disables the file allowlist for `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` and allows *all* files.
[*Might be insecure!*](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html#load-data-local)

##### `allowCleartextPasswords`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

`allowCleartextPasswords=true` allows using the [cleartext client side plugin](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/cleartext-pluggable-authentication.html) if required by an account, such as one defined with the [PAM authentication plugin](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/pam-authentication-plugin.html). Sending passwords in clear text may be a security problem in some configurations. To avoid problems if there is any possibility that the password would be intercepted, clients should connect to MySQL Server using a method that protects the password. Possibilities include [TLS / SSL](#tls), IPsec, or a private network.


##### `allowFallbackToPlaintext`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

`allowFallbackToPlaintext=true` acts like a `--ssl-mode=PREFERRED` MySQL client as described in [Command Options for Connecting to the Server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/connection-options.html#option_general_ssl-mode)

##### `allowNativePasswords`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        true
```
`allowNativePasswords=false` disallows the usage of MySQL native password method.

##### `allowOldPasswords`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```
`allowOldPasswords=true` allows the usage of the insecure old password method. This should be avoided, but is necessary in some cases. See also [the old_passwords wiki page](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/wiki/old_passwords).

##### `charset`

```
Type:           string
Valid Values:   &lt;name&gt;
Default:        none
```

Sets the charset used for client-server interaction (`&quot;SET NAMES &lt;value&gt;&quot;`). If multiple charsets are set (separated by a comma), the following charset is used if setting the charset fails. This enables for example support for `utf8mb4` ([introduced in MySQL 5.5.3](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html)) with fallback to `utf8` for older servers (`charset=utf8mb4,utf8`).

See also [Unicode Support](#unicode-support).

##### `checkConnLiveness`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        true
```

On supported platforms connections retrieved from the connection pool are checked for liveness before using them. If the check fails, the respective connection is marked as bad and the query retried with another connection.
`checkConnLiveness=false` disables this liveness check of connections.

##### `collation`

```
Type:           string
Valid Values:   &lt;name&gt;
Default:        utf8mb4_general_ci
```

Sets the collation used for client-server interaction on connection. In contrast to `charset`, `collation` does not issue additional queries. If the specified collation is unavailable on the target server, the connection will fail.

A list of valid charsets for a server is retrievable with `SHOW COLLATION`.

The default collation (`utf8mb4_general_ci`) is supported from MySQL 5.5.  You should use an older collation (e.g. `utf8_general_ci`) for older MySQL.

Collations for charset &quot;ucs2&quot;, &quot;utf16&quot;, &quot;utf16le&quot;, and &quot;utf32&quot; can not be used ([ref](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-connection.html#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset)).

See also [Unicode Support](#unicode-support).

##### `clientFoundRows`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

`clientFoundRows=true` causes an UPDATE to return the number of matching rows instead of the number of rows changed.

##### `columnsWithAlias`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

When `columnsWithAlias` is true, calls to `sql.Rows.Columns()` will return the table alias and the column name separated by a dot. For example:

```
SELECT u.id FROM users as u
```

will return `u.id` instead of just `id` if `columnsWithAlias=true`.

##### `compress`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

Toggles zlib compression. false by default.

##### `interpolateParams`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

If `interpolateParams` is true, placeholders (`?`) in calls to `db.Query()` and `db.Exec()` are interpolated into a single query string with given parameters. This reduces the number of roundtrips, since the driver has to prepare a statement, execute it with given parameters and close the statement again with `interpolateParams=false`.

*This can not be used together with the multibyte encodings BIG5, CP932, GB2312, GBK or SJIS. These are rejected as they may [introduce a SQL injection vulnerability](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12118602/3430118)!*

##### `loc`

```
Type:           string
Valid Values:   &lt;escaped name&gt;
Default:        UTC
```

Sets the location for time.Time values (when using `parseTime=true`). *&quot;Local&quot;* sets the system&#039;s location. See [time.LoadLocation](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#LoadLocation) for details.

Note that this sets the location for time.Time values but does not change MySQL&#039;s [time_zone setting](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/time-zone-support.html). For that see the [time_zone system variable](#system-variables), which can also be set as a DSN parameter.

Please keep in mind, that param values must be [url.QueryEscape](https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#QueryEscape)&#039;ed. Alternatively you can manually replace the `/` with `%2F`. For example `US/Pacific` would be `loc=US%2FPacific`.

##### `timeTruncate`

```
Type:           duration
Default:        0
```

[Truncate time values](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration.Truncate) to the specified duration. The value must be a decimal number with a unit suffix (*&quot;ms&quot;*, *&quot;s&quot;*, *&quot;m&quot;*, *&quot;h&quot;*), such as *&quot;30s&quot;*, *&quot;0.5m&quot;* or *&quot;1m30s&quot;*.

##### `maxAllowedPacket`
```
Type:          decimal number
Default:       64*1024*1024
```

Max packet size allowed in bytes. The default value is 64 MiB and should be adjusted to match the server settings. `maxAllowedPacket=0` can be used to automatically fetch the `max_allowed_packet` variable from server *on every connection*.

##### `multiStatements`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

Allow multiple statements in one query. This can be used to bach multiple queries. Use [Rows.NextResultSet()](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#Rows.NextResultSet) to get result of the second and subsequent queries.

When `multiStatements` is used, `?` parameters must only be used in the first statement. [interpolateParams](#interpolateparams) can be used to avoid this limitation unless prepared statement is used explicitly.

It&#039;s possible to access the last inserted ID and number of affected rows for multiple statements by using `sql.Conn.Raw()` and the `mysql.Result`. For example:

```go
conn, _ := db.Conn(ctx)
conn.Raw(func(conn any) error {
  ex := conn.(driver.Execer)
  res, err := ex.Exec(`
  UPDATE point SET x = 1 WHERE y = 2;
  UPDATE point SET x = 2 WHERE y = 3;
  `, nil)
  // Both slices have 2 elements.
  log.Print(res.(mysql.Result).AllRowsAffected())
  log.Print(res.(mysql.Result).AllLastInsertIds())
})
```

##### `parseTime`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```

`parseTime=true` changes the output type of `DATE` and `DATETIME` values to `time.Time` instead of `[]byte` / `string`
The date or datetime like `0000-00-00 00:00:00` is converted into zero value of `time.Time`.


##### `readTimeout`

```
Type:           duration
Default:        0
```

I/O read timeout. The value must be a decimal number with a unit suffix (*&quot;ms&quot;*, *&quot;s&quot;*, *&quot;m&quot;*, *&quot;h&quot;*), such as *&quot;30s&quot;*, *&quot;0.5m&quot;* or *&quot;1m30s&quot;*.

##### `rejectReadOnly`

```
Type:           bool
Valid Values:   true, false
Default:        false
```


`rejectReadOnly=true` causes the driver to reject read-only connections. This
is for a possible race condition during an automatic failover, where the mysql
client gets connected to a read-only replica after the failover.

Note that this should be a fairly rare case, as an automatic failover normally
happens when the primary is down, and the race condition shouldn&#039;t happen
unless it comes back up online as soon as the failover is kicked off. On the
other hand, when this happens, a MySQL application can get stuck on a
read-only connection until restarted. It is however fairly easy to reproduce,
for example, using a manual failover on AWS Aurora&#039;s MySQL-compatible cluster.

If you are not relying on read-only transactions to reject writes that aren&#039;t
supposed to happen, setting this on some MySQL providers (such as AWS Aurora)
is safer for failovers.

Note that ERROR 1290 can be returned for a `read-only` server and this option will
cause a retry for that error. However the same error number is used for some
other cases. You should ensure your application will never cause an ERROR 1290
except for `read-only` mode when enabling this option.


##### `serverPubKey`

```
Type:           string
Valid Values:   &lt;name&gt;
Default:        none
```

Server public keys can be registered with [`mysql.RegisterServerPubKey`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#RegisterServerPubKey), which can then be used by the assigned name in the DSN.
Public keys are used to transmit encrypted data, e.g. for authentication.
If the server&#039;s public key is known, it should be set manually to avoid expensive and potentially insecure transmissions of the public key from the server to the client each time it is required.


##### `timeout`

```
Type:           duration
Default:        OS default
```

Timeout for establishing connections, aka dial timeout. The value must be a decimal number with a unit suffix (*&quot;ms&quot;*, *&quot;s&quot;*, *&quot;m&quot;*, *&quot;h&quot;*), such as *&quot;30s&quot;*, *&quot;0.5m&quot;* or *&quot;1m30s&quot;*.


##### `tls`

```
Type:           bool / string
Valid Values:   true, false, skip-verify, preferred, &lt;name&gt;
Default:        false
```

`tls=true` enables TLS / SSL encrypted connection to the server. Use `skip-verify` if you want to use a self-signed or invalid certificate (server side) or use `preferred` to use TLS only when advertised by the server. This is similar to `skip-verify`, but additionally allows a fallback to a connection which is not encrypted. Neither `skip-verify` nor `preferred` add any reliable security. You can use a custom TLS config after registering it with [`mysql.RegisterTLSConfig`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#RegisterTLSConfig).


##### `writeTimeout`

```
Type:           duration
Default:        0
```

I/O write timeout. The value must be a decimal number with a unit suffix (*&quot;ms&quot;*, *&quot;s&quot;*, *&quot;m&quot;*, *&quot;h&quot;*), such as *&quot;30s&quot;*, *&quot;0.5m&quot;* or *&quot;1m30s&quot;*.

##### `connectionAttributes`

```
Type:           comma-delimited string of user-defined &quot;key:value&quot; pairs
Valid Values:   (&lt;name1&gt;:&lt;value1&gt;,&lt;name2&gt;:&lt;value2&gt;,...)
Default:        none
```

[Connection attributes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-connection-attribute-tables.html) are key-value pairs that application programs can pass to the server at connect time.

##### System Variables

Any other parameters are interpreted as system variables:
  * `&lt;boolean_var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`: `SET &lt;boolean_var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`
  * `&lt;enum_var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`: `SET &lt;enum_var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`
  * `&lt;string_var&gt;=%27&lt;value&gt;%27`: `SET &lt;string_var&gt;=&#039;&lt;value&gt;&#039;`

Rules:
* The values for string variables must be quoted with `&#039;`.
* The values must also be [url.QueryEscape](http://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#QueryEscape)&#039;ed!
 (which implies values of string variables must be wrapped with `%27`).

Examples:
  * `autocommit=1`: `SET autocommit=1`
  * [`time_zone=%27Europe%2FParis%27`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/

![koanf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/547147/72681838-6981dd00-3aed-11ea-8f5d-310816c70c08.png)

**koanf** is a library for reading configuration from different sources in different formats in Go applications. It is a cleaner, lighter [alternative to spf13/viper](#alternative-to-viper) with better abstractions and extensibility and far fewer dependencies.

koanf v2 has modules (Providers) for reading configuration from a variety of sources such as files, command line flags, environment variables, Vault, and S3 and for parsing (Parsers) formats such as JSON, YAML, TOML, HUML, Hashicorp HCL. It is easy to plug in custom parsers and providers.

All external dependencies in providers and parsers are detached from the core and can be installed separately as necessary.

[![Run Tests](https://github.com/knadh/koanf/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/knadh/koanf/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/knadh/koanf?utm_source=godoc)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/knadh/koanf/v2)

### Concepts

- `koanf.Provider` is a generic interface that provides configuration, for example, from files, environment variables, HTTP sources, or anywhere. The configuration can either be raw bytes that a parser can parse, or it can be a nested `map[string]any` that can be directly loaded.
- `koanf.Parser` is a generic interface that takes raw bytes, parses, and returns a nested `map[string]any`. For example, JSON and YAML parsers.
- Once loaded into koanf, configuration are values queried by a delimited key path syntax. eg: `app.server.port`. Any delimiter can be chosen.
- Configuration from multiple sources can be loaded and merged into a koanf instance, for example, load from a file first and override certain values with flags from the command line.

With these two interface implementations, koanf can obtain configuration in any format from any source, parse it, and make it available to an application.

### Reading config from files

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/json&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/yaml&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/file&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use &quot;.&quot; as the key path delimiter. This can be &quot;/&quot; or any character.
var k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)

func main() {
	// Load JSON config.
	if err := k.Load(file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.json&quot;), json.Parser()); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	// Load YAML config and merge into the previously loaded config (because we can).
	k.Load(file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.yml&quot;), yaml.Parser())

	fmt.Println(&quot;parent&#039;s name is = &quot;, k.String(&quot;parent1.name&quot;))
	fmt.Println(&quot;parent&#039;s ID is = &quot;, k.Int(&quot;parent1.id&quot;))
}

```

### Watching file for changes
Some providers expose a `Watch()` method that makes the provider watch for changes
in configuration and trigger a callback to reload the configuration.
This is not goroutine safe if there are concurrent `*Get()` calls happening on the
koanf object while it is doing a `Load()`. Such scenarios will need mutex locking.

`file, appconfig, vault, consul` providers have a `Watch()` method.


```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/json&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/yaml&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/file&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use &quot;.&quot; as the key path delimiter. This can be &quot;/&quot; or any character.
var k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)

func main() {
	// Load JSON config.
	f := file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.json&quot;)
	if err := k.Load(f, json.Parser()); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	// Load YAML config and merge into the previously loaded config (because we can).
	k.Load(file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.yml&quot;), yaml.Parser())

	fmt.Println(&quot;parent&#039;s name is = &quot;, k.String(&quot;parent1.name&quot;))
	fmt.Println(&quot;parent&#039;s ID is = &quot;, k.Int(&quot;parent1.id&quot;))

	// Watch the file and get a callback on change. The callback can do whatever,
	// like re-load the configuration.
	// File provider always returns a nil `event`.
	f.Watch(func(event any, err error) {
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf(&quot;watch error: %v&quot;, err)
			return
		}

		// Throw away the old config and load a fresh copy.
		log.Println(&quot;config changed. Reloading ...&quot;)
		k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)
		k.Load(f, json.Parser())
		k.Print()
	})

	// To stop a file watcher, call:
	// f.Unwatch()

	// Block forever (and manually make a change to mock/mock.json) to
	// reload the config.
	log.Println(&quot;waiting forever. Try making a change to mock/mock.json to live reload&quot;)
	&lt;-make(chan bool)
}
```


### Reading from command line

The following example shows the use of `posflag.Provider`, a wrapper over the [spf13/pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag) library, an advanced commandline lib. For Go&#039;s built in `flag` package, use `basicflag.Provider`.

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/toml&quot;

	// TOML version 2 is available at:
	// &quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/toml/v2&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/file&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/posflag&quot;
	flag &quot;github.com/spf13/pflag&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use &quot;.&quot; as the key path delimiter. This can be &quot;/&quot; or any character.
var k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)

func main() {
	// Use the POSIX compliant pflag lib instead of Go&#039;s flag lib.
	f := flag.NewFlagSet(&quot;config&quot;, flag.ContinueOnError)
	f.Usage = func() {
		fmt.Println(f.FlagUsages())
		os.Exit(0)
	}
	// Path to one or more config files to load into koanf along with some config params.
	f.StringSlice(&quot;conf&quot;, []string{&quot;mock/mock.toml&quot;}, &quot;path to one or more .toml config files&quot;)
	f.String(&quot;time&quot;, &quot;2020-01-01&quot;, &quot;a time string&quot;)
	f.String(&quot;type&quot;, &quot;xxx&quot;, &quot;type of the app&quot;)
	f.Parse(os.Args[1:])

	// Load the config files provided in the commandline.
	cFiles, _ := f.GetStringSlice(&quot;conf&quot;)
	for _, c := range cFiles {
		if err := k.Load(file.Provider(c), toml.Parser()); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading file: %v&quot;, err)
		}
	}

	// &quot;time&quot; and &quot;type&quot; may have been loaded from the config file, but
	// they can still be overridden with the values from the command line.
	// The bundled posflag.Provider takes a flagset from the spf13/pflag lib.
	// Passing the Koanf instance to posflag helps it deal with default command
	// line flag values that are not present in conf maps from previously loaded
	// providers.
	if err := k.Load(posflag.Provider(f, &quot;.&quot;, k), nil); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	fmt.Println(&quot;time is = &quot;, k.String(&quot;time&quot;))
}
```

### Reading environment variables

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;strings&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/json&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/env/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/file&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use . as the key path delimiter. This can be / or anything.
var k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)

func main() {
	// Load JSON config.
	if err := k.Load(file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.json&quot;), json.Parser()); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	// Load only environment variables with prefix &quot;MYVAR_&quot; and merge into config.
	// Transform var names by:
	// 1. Converting to lowercase
	// 2. Removing &quot;MYVAR_&quot; prefix  
	// 3. Replacing &quot;_&quot; with &quot;.&quot; to representing nesting using the . delimiter.
	// Example: MYVAR_PARENT1_CHILD1_NAME becomes &quot;parent1.child1.name&quot;
	k.Load(env.Provider(&quot;.&quot;, env.Opt{
		Prefix: &quot;MYVAR_&quot;,
		TransformFunc: func(k, v string) (string, any) {
			// Transform the key.
			k = strings.ReplaceAll(strings.ToLower(strings.TrimPrefix(k, &quot;MYVAR_&quot;)), &quot;_&quot;, &quot;.&quot;)

			// Transform the value into slices, if they contain spaces.
			// Eg: MYVAR_TAGS=&quot;foo bar baz&quot; -&gt; tags: [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;]
			// This is to demonstrate that string values can be transformed to any type
			// where necessary.
			if strings.Contains(v, &quot; &quot;) {
				return k, strings.Split(v, &quot; &quot;)
			}

			return k, v
		},
	}), nil)

	fmt.Println(&quot;name is =&quot;, k.String(&quot;parent1.child1.name&quot;))
	fmt.Println(&quot;time is =&quot;, k.Time(&quot;time&quot;, time.DateOnly))
	fmt.Println(&quot;ids are =&quot;, k.Strings(&quot;parent1.child1.grandchild1.ids&quot;))
}
```

### Reading from an S3 bucket

```go
// Load JSON config from s3.
if err := k.Load(s3.Provider(s3.Config{
	AccessKey: os.Getenv(&quot;AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY&quot;),
	SecretKey: os.Getenv(&quot;AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY&quot;),
	Region:    os.Getenv(&quot;AWS_S3_REGION&quot;),
	Bucket:    os.Getenv(&quot;AWS_S3_BUCKET&quot;),
	ObjectKey: &quot;dir/config.json&quot;,
}), json.Parser()); err != nil {
	log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
}
```

### Reading raw bytes

The bundled `rawbytes` Provider can be used to read arbitrary bytes from a source, like a database or an HTTP call.

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/json&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/rawbytes&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use . as the key path delimiter. This can be / or anything.
var k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)

func main() {
	b := []byte(`{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;rawbytes&quot;, &quot;parent1&quot;: {&quot;child1&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;rawbytes&quot;}}}`)
	k.Load(rawbytes.Provider(b), json.Parser())
	fmt.Println(&quot;type is = &quot;, k.String(&quot;parent1.child1.type&quot;))
}
```

### Unmarshalling and marshalling
`Parser`s can be used to unmarshal and scan the values in a Koanf instance into a struct based on the field tags, and to marshal a Koanf instance back into serialized bytes, for example to JSON or YAML files

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/json&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/file&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use . as the key path delimiter. This can be / or anything.
var (
	k      = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)
	parser = json.Parser()
)

func main() {
	// Load JSON config.
	if err := k.Load(file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.json&quot;), parser); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	// Structure to unmarshal nested conf to.
	type childStruct struct {
		Name       string            `koanf:&quot;name&quot;`
		Type       string            `koanf:&quot;type&quot;`
		Empty      map[string]string `koanf:&quot;empty&quot;`
		GrandChild struct {
			Ids []int `koanf:&quot;ids&quot;`
			On  bool  `koanf:&quot;on&quot;`
		} `koanf:&quot;grandchild1&quot;`
	}

	var out childStruct

	// Quick unmarshal.
	k.Unmarshal(&quot;parent1.child1&quot;, &amp;out)
	fmt.Println(out)

	// Unmarshal with advanced config.
	out = childStruct{}
	k.UnmarshalWithConf(&quot;parent1.child1&quot;, &amp;out, koanf.UnmarshalConf{Tag: &quot;koanf&quot;})
	fmt.Println(out)

	// Marshal the instance back to JSON.
	// The parser instance can be anything, eg: json.Parser(), yaml.Parser() etc.
	b, _ := k.Marshal(parser)
	fmt.Println(string(b))
}
```

### Unmarshalling with flat paths

Sometimes it is necessary to unmarshal an assortment of keys from various nested structures into a flat target structure. This is possible with the `UnmarshalConf.FlatPaths` flag.

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/json&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/file&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use . as the key path delimiter. This can be / or anything.
var k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)

func main() {
	// Load JSON config.
	if err := k.Load(file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.json&quot;), json.Parser()); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	type rootFlat struct {
		Type                        string            `koanf:&quot;type&quot;`
		Empty                       map[string]string `koanf:&quot;empty&quot;`
		Parent1Name                 string            `koanf:&quot;parent1.name&quot;`
		Parent1ID                   int               `koanf:&quot;parent1.id&quot;`
		Parent1Child1Name           string            `koanf:&quot;parent1.child1.name&quot;`
		Parent1Child1Type           string            `koanf:&quot;parent1.child1.type&quot;`
		Parent1Child1Empty          map[string]string `koanf:&quot;parent1.child1.empty&quot;`
		Parent1Child1Grandchild1IDs []int             `koanf:&quot;parent1.child1.grandchild1.ids&quot;`
		Parent1Child1Grandchild1On  bool              `koanf:&quot;parent1.child1.grandchild1.on&quot;`
	}

	// Unmarshal the whole root with FlatPaths: True.
	var o1 rootFlat
	k.UnmarshalWithConf(&quot;&quot;, &amp;o1, koanf.UnmarshalConf{Tag: &quot;koanf&quot;, FlatPaths: true})
	fmt.Println(o1)

	// Unmarshal a child structure of &quot;parent1&quot;.
	type subFlat struct {
		Name                 string            `koanf:&quot;name&quot;`
		ID                   int               `koanf:&quot;id&quot;`
		Child1Name           string            `koanf:&quot;child1.name&quot;`
		Child1Type           string            `koanf:&quot;child1.type&quot;`
		Child1Empty          map[string]string `koanf:&quot;child1.empty&quot;`
		Child1Grandchild1IDs []int             `koanf:&quot;child1.grandchild1.ids&quot;`
		Child1Grandchild1On  bool              `koanf:&quot;child1.grandchild1.on&quot;`
	}

	var o2 subFlat
	k.UnmarshalWithConf(&quot;parent1&quot;, &amp;o2, koanf.UnmarshalConf{Tag: &quot;koanf&quot;, FlatPaths: true})
	fmt.Println(o2)
}
```

#### Reading from nested maps

The bundled `confmap` provider takes a `map[string]any` that can be loaded into a koanf instance. 

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/confmap&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/file&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/json&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/yaml&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use &quot;.&quot; as the key path delimiter. This can be &quot;/&quot; or any character.
var k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)

func main() {
	// Load default values using the confmap provider.
	// We provide a flat map with the &quot;.&quot; delimiter.
	// A nested map can be loaded by setting the delimiter to an empty string &quot;&quot;.
	k.Load(confmap.Provider(map[string]any{
		&quot;parent1.name&quot;: &quot;Default Name&quot;,
		&quot;parent3.name&quot;: &quot;New name here&quot;,
	}, &quot;.&quot;), nil)

	// Load JSON config on top of the default values.
	if err := k.Load(file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.json&quot;), json.Parser()); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	// Load YAML config and merge into the previously loaded config (because we can).
	k.Load(file.Provider(&quot;mock/mock.yml&quot;), yaml.Parser())

	fmt.Println(&quot;parent&#039;s name is = &quot;, k.String(&quot;parent1.name&quot;))
	fmt.Println(&quot;parent&#039;s ID is = &quot;, k.Int(&quot;parent1.id&quot;))
}
```

#### Reading from struct 

The bundled `structs` provider can be used to read data from a struct to load into a koanf instance.

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/structs&quot;
)

// Global koanf instance. Use &quot;.&quot; as the key path delimiter. This can be &quot;/&quot; or any character.
var k = koanf.New(&quot;.&quot;)

type parentStruct struct {
	Name   string      `koanf:&quot;name&quot;`
	ID     int         `koanf:&quot;id&quot;`
	Child1 childStruct `koanf:&quot;child1&quot;`
}
type childStruct struct {
	Name        string            `koanf:&quot;name&quot;`
	Type        string            `koanf:&quot;type&quot;`
	Empty       map[string]string `koanf:&quot;empty&quot;`
	Grandchild1 grandchildStruct  `koanf:&quot;grandchild1&quot;`
}
type grandchildStruct struct {
	Ids []int `koanf:&quot;ids&quot;`
	On  bool  `koanf:&quot;on&quot;`
}
type sampleStruct struct {
	Type    string            `koanf:&quot;type&quot;`
	Empty   map[string]string `koanf:&quot;empty&quot;`
	Parent1 parentStruct      `koanf:&quot;parent1&quot;`
}

func main() {
	// Load default values using the structs provider.
	// We provide a struct along with the struct tag `koanf` to the
	// provider.
	k.Load(structs.Provider(sampleStruct{
		Type:  &quot;json&quot;,
		Empty: make(map[string]string),
		Parent1: parentStruct{
			Name: &quot;parent1&quot;,
			ID:   1234,
			Child1: childStruct{
				Name:  &quot;child1&quot;,
				Type:  &quot;json&quot;,
				Empty: make(map[string]string),
				Grandchild1: grandchildStruct{
					Ids: []int{1, 2, 3},
					On:  true,
				},
			},
		},
	}, &quot;koanf&quot;), nil)

	fmt.Printf(&quot;name is = `%s`\n&quot;, k.String(&quot;parent1.child1.name&quot;))
}
```
### Merge behavior
#### Default behavior
The default behavior when you create Koanf this way is: `koanf.New(delim)` that the latest loaded configuration will
merge with the previous one.

For example:
`first.yml`
```yaml
key: [1,2,3]
```
`second.yml`
```yaml
key: &#039;string&#039;
```
When `second.yml` is loaded it will override the type of the `first.yml`.

If this behavior is not desired, you can merge &#039;strictly&#039;. In the same scenario, `Load` will return an error.

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;errors&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/maps&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/json&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/parsers/yaml&quot;
	&quot;github.com/knadh/koanf/providers/file&quot;
)

var conf = koanf.Conf{
	Delim:       &quot;.&quot;,
	StrictMerge: true,
}
var k = koanf.NewWithConf(conf)

func main() {
	yamlPath := &quot;mock/mock.yml&quot;
	if err := k.Load(file.Provider(yamlPath), yaml.Parser()); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	jsonPath := &quot;mock/mock.json&quot;
	if err := k.Load(file.Provider(jsonPath), json.Parser()); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;error loading config: %v&quot;, err)
	}
}
```
**Note:** When merging different extensions, each parser can treat his types differently,
 meaning even though you the load same types there is a probability that it will fail with `StrictMerge: true`.

For example: merging JSON and YAML will most likely fail because JSON treats integers as float64 and YAML treats them as integers.

### Order of merge and key case sensitivity

- Config keys are case-sensitive in koanf. For example, `app.server.port` and `APP.SERVER.port` are not the same.
- koanf does not impose any ordering on loading config from various providers. Every successive `Load()` or `Merge()` merges new config into the existing config. That is, it is possible to load environment variables first, then files on top of it, and then command line variables on top of it, or any such order.

### Custom Providers and Parsers

A Provider returns a nested `map[string]any` config that can be loaded directly into koanf with `koanf.Load()` or it can return raw bytes that can be parsed with a Parser (again, loaded using `koanf.Load()`. Writing Providers and Parsers are easy. See the bundled implementations in the [providers](https://github.com/knadh/koanf/tree/master/providers) and [parsers](https://github.com/knadh/koanf/tree/master/parsers) directories.

### Custom merge strategies

By default, when merging two config sources using `Load()`, koanf recursively merges keys of nested maps (`map[string]any`),
while static values are overwritten (slices, strings, etc). This behaviour can be changed by providing a custom merge function with the `WithMergeFunc` option.

```go
package main

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary
archives are published at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.23 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

| **`geth`** | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options) for command line options. |
|   `clef`   | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we&#039;ve enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

Minimum:

* CPU with 4+ cores
* 8GB RAM
* 1TB free storage space to sync the Mainnet
* 8 MBit/sec download Internet service

Recommended:

* Fast CPU with 8+ cores
* 16GB+ RAM
* High-performance SSD with at least 1TB of free space
* 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum
network: create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this
particular use case, the user doesn&#039;t care about years-old historical data, so we can
sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:

```shell
$ geth console
```

This command will:
 * Start `geth` in snap sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
   of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start the built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/javascript-console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/blob/0.20.7/DOCUMENTATION.md) 
   (note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
   as well as `geth`&#039;s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach it to an already running
   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.

### A Full node on the Holesky test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you&#039;d like to play around with creating Ethereum
contracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until
you get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main
network, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to
the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```shell
$ geth --holesky console
```

The `console` subcommand has the same meaning as above and is equally
useful on the testnet too.

Specifying the `--holesky` flag, however, will reconfigure your `geth` instance a bit:

 * Instead of connecting to the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the Holesky 
   test network, which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis
   states.
 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), `geth`
   will nest itself one level deeper into a `holesky` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/holesky` on
   Linux). Note, on OSX and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node
   requires the use of a custom endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a
   production node endpoint by default, e.g.,
   `geth attach &lt;datadir&gt;/holesky/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by
   this.

*Note: Although some internal protective measures prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should always
use separate accounts for play and real money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

#### Docker quick start

One of the quickest ways to get Ethereum up and running on your machine is by using
Docker:

```shell
docker run -d --name ethereum-node -v /Users/alice/ethereum:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           ethereum/client-go
```

This will start `geth` in snap-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB, as the
above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for
saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag
available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers
and/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints are not
accessible from the outside.

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you&#039;ll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you&#039;d expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API&#039;s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API&#039;s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You&#039;ll need to use your own programming environments&#039; capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you&#039;ll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for
granted in the official networks need to be manually set up.

Unfortunately since [the Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/) it is no longer possible
to easily set up a network of geth nodes without also setting up a corresponding beacon chain.

There are three different solutions depending on your use case:

  * If you are looking for a simple way to test smart contracts from go in your CI, you can use the [Simulated Backend](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings#blockchain-simulator).
  * If you want a convenient single node environment for testing, you can use our [Dev Mode](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/dev-mode).
  * If you are looking for a multiple node test network, you can set one up quite easily with [Kurtosis](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/kurtosis).

### Waste

![](https://github.com/elC0mpa/aws-cost-billing/blob/main/demo/waste.gif)

## Features

- **📉 Cost Comparison:** Compares costs between the current and previous month for the exact same period (e.g., comparing Jan 1–15 vs Feb 1–15) to give a fair assessment of spending velocity.
- **🏥 Waste Detection (The &quot;Checkup&quot;):** Scans your account for &quot;zombie&quot; resources and inefficiencies that are silently inflating your bill.
- **📊 Trend Analysis:** Visualizes cost history over the last 6 months to spot long-term anomalies.

## Motivation

As a Cloud Architect, I often need to check AWS costs and billing information. While the AWS Console provides raw data, it lacks the immediate context I need to answer the question: _&quot;Are we spending efficiently?&quot;_

I created **aws-doctor** to fill that gap. It doesn&#039;t just show you the bill; it acts as a diagnostic tool that helps you understand **where** the money is going and **what** can be cleaned up. It automates the routine checks I used to perform manually, serving as a free, open-source alternative to the paid recommendations found in AWS Trusted Advisor.

The remote GitHub MCP Server is hosted by GitHub and provides the easiest method for getting up and running. If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don&#039;t worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.

### Prerequisites

1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)

### Install in VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you&#039;re using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.

Alternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Using OAuth&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Using a GitHub PAT&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=left colspan=2&gt;VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```json
{
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```json
{
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}&quot;
      }
    }
  },
  &quot;inputs&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;github_mcp_pat&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;GitHub Personal Access Token&quot;,
      &quot;password&quot;: true
    }
  ]
}
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- **[Rovo Dev CLI](/docs/installation-guides/install-rovo-dev-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Rovo Dev CLI

&gt; **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application&#039;s documentation for more info.

### Configuration

#### Toolset configuration

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

#### Insiders Mode

&gt; **Try new features early!** The remote server offers an insiders version with early access to new features and experimental tools.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Using URL Path&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Using Header&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```json
{
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/insiders&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

```json
{
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;X-MCP-Insiders&quot;: &quot;true&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md#insiders-mode) for more details and examples.

#### GitHub Enterprise

##### GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.

Example for `https://octocorp.ghe.com` with GitHub PAT token:

```
{
    ...
    &quot;proxima-github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp&quot;,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}&quot;
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

&gt; **Note:** When using OAuth with GitHub Enterprise with VS Code and GitHub Copilot, you also need to configure your VS Code settings to point to your GitHub Enterprise instance - see [Authenticate from VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/authenticate-to-ghecom)

##### GitHub Enterprise Server

GitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.

### Prerequisites

1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The Docker image is available at `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.
3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
The MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handling PATs Securely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

### Environment Variables (Recommended)

To keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:

1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

   Or create a `.env` file:

   ```env
   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Protect your `.env` file**

   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
   echo &quot;.env&quot; &gt;&gt; .gitignore
   ```

3. **Reference the token in configurations**

   ```bash
   # CLI usage
   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT

   # In config files (where supported)
   &quot;env&quot;: {
     &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;$GITHUB_PAT&quot;
   }
   ```

&gt; **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.

### Token Security Best Practices

- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions
  - `repo` - Repository operations
  - `read:packages` - Docker image access
  - `read:org` - Organization team access
- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments
- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically
- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control
- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens

  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json
  ```

&lt;/details&gt;

### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

The flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set
the hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.

- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.
- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.

``` json
&quot;github&quot;: {
    &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
    &quot;args&quot;: [
    &quot;run&quot;,
    &quot;-i&quot;,
    &quot;--rm&quot;,
    &quot;-e&quot;,
    &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,
    &quot;-e&quot;,
    &quot;GITHUB_HOST&quot;,
    &quot;ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server&quot;
    ],
    &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;${input:github_token}&quot;,
        &quot;GITHUB_HOST&quot;: &quot;https://&lt;your GHES or ghe.com domain name&gt;&quot;
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.

More about using MCP server tools in VS Code&#039;s [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

Install in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)

Add the following JSON block to your IDE&#039;s MCP settings.

```json
{
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;inputs&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;github_token&quot;,
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;GitHub Personal Access Token&quot;,
        &quot;password&quot;: true
      }
    ],
    &quot;servers&quot;: {
      &quot;github&quot;: {
        &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [
          &quot;run&quot;,
          &quot;-i&quot;,
          &quot;--rm&quot;,
          &quot;-e&quot;,
          &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,
          &quot;ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server&quot;
        ],
        &quot;env&quot;: {
          &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;${input:github_token}&quot;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example JSON block without the MCP key included&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```json
{
  &quot;inputs&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;promptString&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;github_token&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;GitHub Personal Access Token&quot;,
      &quot;password&quot;: true
    }
  ],
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,
        &quot;ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;${input:github_token}&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Install in Other MCP Hosts

For other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:

- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot
- **[Claude Code &amp; Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop
- **[Cursor](docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE
- **[Google Gemini CLI](docs/installation-guides/install-gemini-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Google Gemini CLI
- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE

For a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.

&gt; **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application&#039;s documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.

### Build from source

If you don&#039;t have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the
`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:

```JSON
{
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;servers&quot;: {
      &quot;github&quot;: {
        &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/github-mcp-server&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;stdio&quot;],
        &quot;env&quot;: {
          &quot;GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;&quot;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### CLI utilities

The `github-mcp-server` binary includes a few CLI subcommands that are helpful for debugging and exploring the server.

- `github-mcp-server tool-search &quot;&lt;query&gt;&quot;` searches tools by name, description, and input parameter names. Use `--max-results` to return more matches.
Example (color output requires a TTY; use `docker run -t` (or `-it`) when running in Docker):
```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server tool-search &quot;issue&quot; --max-results 5
github-mcp-server tool-search &quot;issue&quot; --max-results 5
```

## Tool Configuration

The GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.

_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

&gt; **Looking for examples?** See the [Server Configuration Guide](./docs/server-configuration.md) for common recipes like minimal setups, read-only mode, and combining tools with toolsets.

#### Specifying Toolsets

To specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:

   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLSETS=&quot;repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security&quot; ./github-mcp-server
   ```

The environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.

#### Specifying Individual Tools

You can also configure specific tools using the `--tools` flag. Tools can be used independently or combined with toolsets and dynamic toolsets discovery for fine-grained control.

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:

   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLS=&quot;get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request&quot; ./github-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Combining with Toolsets** (additive):

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues --tools get_gist
   ```

   This registers all tools from `repos` and `issues` toolsets, plus `get_gist`.

4. **Combining with Dynamic Toolsets** (additive):

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents --dynamic-toolsets
   ```

   This registers `get_file_contents` plus the dynamic toolset tools (`enable_toolset`, `list_available_toolsets`, `get_toolset_tools`).

**Important Notes:**

- Tools, toolsets, and dynamic toolsets can all be used together
- Read-only mode takes priority: write tools are skipped if `--read-only` is set, even if explicitly requested via `--tools`
- Tool names must match exactly (e.g., `get_file_contents`, not `getFileContents`). Invalid tool names will cause the server to fail at startup with an error message
- When tools are renamed, old names are preserved as aliases for backward compatibility. See [Deprecated Tool Aliases](docs/deprecated-tool-aliases.md) for details.

### Using Toolsets With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=&lt;your-token&gt; \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=&quot;repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security&quot; \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Using Tools With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass specific tools as environment variables. You can also combine tools with toolsets:

```bash
# Tools only
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=&lt;your-token&gt; \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLS=&quot;get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request&quot; \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server

# Tools combined with toolsets (additive)
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=&lt;your-token&gt; \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=&quot;repos,issues&quot; \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLS=&quot;get_gist&quot; \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Special toolsets

#### &quot;all&quot; toolset

The special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:

```bash
./github-mcp-server --toolsets all
```

## What is frp?

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone&#039;s needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh1&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-a.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh2&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-b.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-a.example.com`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-b.example.com`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhostHTTPSPort`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;web&quot;
  type = &quot;http&quot;
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = [&quot;www.example.com&quot;]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;dns&quot;
  type = &quot;udp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  unixPath = &quot;/var/run/docker.sock&quot;
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_static_file&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;static_file&quot;
  localPath = &quot;/tmp/files&quot;
  stripPrefix = &quot;static&quot;
  httpUser = &quot;abc&quot;
  httpPassword = &quot;abc&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `localAddr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_https2http&quot;
  type = &quot;https&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;test.example.com&quot;]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;https2http&quot;
  localAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:80&quot;
  crtPath = &quot;./server.crt&quot;
  keyPath = &quot;./server.key&quot;
  hostHeaderRewrite = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = &quot;frp&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `secretKey` field for the preshared key, and that the `remotePort` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`secretKey` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn&#039;t work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

These configuration files is for reference only. Please do not use this configuration directly to run the program as it may have various issues.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps_full_example.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc_full_example.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go&#039;s standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}&quot;
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = {{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remem

# 💡 WeKnora - LLM-Powered Document Understanding &amp; Retrieval Framework

## 📌 Overview

[**WeKnora**](https://weknora.weixin.qq.com) is an LLM-powered framework designed for deep document understanding and semantic retrieval, especially for handling complex, heterogeneous documents. 

It adopts a modular architecture that combines multimodal preprocessing, semantic vector indexing, intelligent retrieval, and large language model inference. At its core, WeKnora follows the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** paradigm, enabling high-quality, context-aware answers by combining relevant document chunks with model reasoning.

# Overview

**Eino[&#039;aino]** (pronounced similarly to &quot;I know&quot;) aims to be the ultimate LLM application development framework in Golang. Drawing inspirations from many excellent LLM application development frameworks in the open-source community such as LangChain &amp; Google ADK, etc., as well as learning from cutting-edge research and real world applications, Eino offers an LLM application development framework that emphasizes on simplicity, scalability, reliability and effectiveness that better aligns with Golang programming conventions.

What Eino provides are:
- a carefully curated list of **component** abstractions and implementations that can be easily reused and combined to build LLM applications
- a powerful **composition** framework that does the heavy lifting of strong type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection, option assignment, etc. for the user.
- an **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** that provides high-level abstractions for building AI agents with multi-agent orchestration, human-in-the-loop interrupts, and prebuilt agent patterns.
- a set of meticulously designed **API** that obsesses on simplicity and clarity.
- an ever-growing collection of best practices in the form of bundled **flows** and **examples**.
- a useful set of tools that covers the entire development cycle, from visualized development and debugging to online tracing and evaluation.

With the above arsenal, Eino can standardize, simplify, and improve efficiency at different stages of the AI application development cycle:
![](.github/static/img/eino/eino_concept.jpeg)

# A quick walkthrough

Use a component directly:
```Go
model, _ := openai.NewChatModel(ctx, config) // create an invokable LLM instance
message, _ := model.Generate(ctx, []*Message{
    SystemMessage(&quot;you are a helpful assistant.&quot;),
    UserMessage(&quot;what does the future AI App look like?&quot;)})
```

Of course, you can do that, Eino provides lots of useful components to use out of the box. But you can do more by using orchestration, for three reasons:
- orchestration encapsulates common patterns of LLM application.
- orchestration solves the difficult problem of processing stream response by the LLM.
- orchestration handles type safety, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment for you.

Eino provides three set of APIs for orchestration

| API      | Characteristics and usage                                             |
| -------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chain    | Simple chained directed graph that can only go forward.               |
| Graph    | Cyclic or Acyclic directed graph. Powerful and flexible.              |
| Workflow | Acyclic graph that supports data mapping at struct field level. |

Let&#039;s create a simple chain: a ChatTemplate followed by a ChatModel.

![](.github/static/img/eino/simple_chain.png)

```Go
chain, _ := NewChain[map[string]any, *Message]().
           AppendChatTemplate(prompt).
           AppendChatModel(model).
           Compile(ctx)

chain.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;what&#039;s your name?&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a graph that uses a ChatModel to generate answer or tool calls, then uses a ToolsNode to execute those tools if needed.

![](.github/static/img/eino/tool_call_graph.png)

```Go
graph := NewGraph[map[string]any, *schema.Message]()

_ = graph.AddChatTemplateNode(&quot;node_template&quot;, chatTpl)
_ = graph.AddChatModelNode(&quot;node_model&quot;, chatModel)
_ = graph.AddToolsNode(&quot;node_tools&quot;, toolsNode)
_ = graph.AddLambdaNode(&quot;node_converter&quot;, takeOne)

_ = graph.AddEdge(START, &quot;node_template&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_template&quot;, &quot;node_model&quot;)
_ = graph.AddBranch(&quot;node_model&quot;, branch)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_tools&quot;, &quot;node_converter&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_converter&quot;, END)

compiledGraph, err := graph.Compile(ctx)
if err != nil {
return err
}
out, err := compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;:&quot;Beijing&#039;s weather this weekend&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a workflow that flexibly maps input &amp; output at the field level:

![](.github/static/img/eino/simple_workflow.png)

```Go
type Input1 struct {
    Input string
}

type Output1 struct {
    Output string
}

type Input2 struct {
    Role schema.RoleType
}

type Output2 struct {
    Output string
}

type Input3 struct {
    Query string
    MetaData string
}

var (
    ctx context.Context
    m model.BaseChatModel
    lambda1 func(context.Context, Input1) (Output1, error)
    lambda2 func(context.Context, Input2) (Output2, error)
    lambda3 func(context.Context, Input3) (*schema.Message, error)

Eino&#039;s **graph orchestration** provides the following benefits out of the box:
- Type checking: it makes sure the two nodes&#039; input and output types match at compile time.
- Stream processing: concatenates message stream before passing to chatModel and toolsNode if needed, and copies the stream into callback handlers.
- Concurrency management: the shared state can be safely read and written because the StatePreHandler is concurrency safe.
- Aspect injection: injects callback aspects before and after the execution of ChatModel if the specified ChatModel implementation hasn&#039;t injected itself.
- Option assignment: call options are assigned either globally, to specific component type or to specific node.

For example, you could easily extend the compiled graph with callbacks:
```Go
handler := NewHandlerBuilder().
  OnStartFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, input CallbackInput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onStart, runInfo: %v, input: %v&quot;, info, input)
    }).
  OnEndFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, output CallbackOutput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onEnd, runInfo: %v, out: %v&quot;, info, output)
    }).
  Build()
  
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))
```

or you could easily assign options to different nodes:
```Go
// assign to All nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))

// assign only to ChatModel nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithChatModelOption(WithTemperature(0.5))

// assign only to node_1
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler).DesignateNode(&quot;node_1&quot;))
```

Now let&#039;s create a &#039;ReAct&#039; agent: A ChatModel binds to Tools. It receives input Messages and decides independently whether to call the Tool or output the final result. The execution result of the Tool will again become the input Message for the ChatModel and serve as the context for the next round of independent judgment.

Eino&#039;s **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** provides `ChatModelAgent` that implements this pattern out of the box:

```Go
agent, _ := adk.NewChatModelAgent(ctx, &amp;adk.ChatModelAgentConfig{
    Name:        &quot;assistant&quot;,
    Description: &quot;A helpful assistant that can use tools&quot;,
    Model:       chatModel,
    ToolsConfig: adk.ToolsConfig{
        ToolsNodeConfig: compose.ToolsNodeConfig{
            Tools: []tool.BaseTool{weatherTool, calculatorTool},
        },
    },
})

runner := adk.NewRunner(ctx, adk.RunnerConfig{Agent: agent})
iter := runner.Query(ctx, &quot;What&#039;s the weather in Beijing this weekend?&quot;)
for {
    event, ok := iter.Next()
    if !ok {
        break
    }
    // process agent events (model outputs, tool calls, etc.)
}
```

The ADK handles the ReAct loop internally, emitting events for each step of the agent&#039;s reasoning process.

Beyond the basic ReAct pattern, ADK provides powerful capabilities for building production-ready agent systems:

**Multi-Agent with Context Management**: Agents can transfer control to sub-agents or be wrapped as tools. The framework automatically manages conversation context across agent boundaries:

```Go
// Set up agent hierarchy - mainAgent can now transfer to sub-agents
mainAgentWithSubs, _ := adk.SetSubAgents(ctx, mainAgent, []adk.Agent{researchAgent, codeAgent})
```

When `mainAgent` transfers to `researchAgent`, the conversation history is automatically rewritten to provide appropriate context for the sub-agent.

Agents can also be wrapped as tools, allowing one agent to invoke another as part of its tool-calling workflow:

```Go
// Wrap an agent as a tool that can be called by other agents
researchTool := adk.NewAgentTool(ctx, researchAgent)
```

**Interrupt Anywhere, Resume Directly**: Any agent can pause execution for human approval or external input, and resume exactly where it left off:

```Go
// Inside a tool or agent, trigger an interrupt
return adk.Interrupt(ctx, &quot;Please confirm this action&quot;)

// Later, resume from checkpoint
iter, _ := runner.Resume(ctx, checkpointID)
```

**Prebuilt Agent Patterns**: Ready-to-use implementations for common architectures:

```Go
// Deep Agent: battle-tested pattern for complex task orchestration with 
// built-in task management, sub-agent delegation, and progress tracking
deepAgent, _ := deep.New(ctx, &amp;deep.Config{
    Name:        &quot;deep_agent&quot;,
    Description: &quot;An agent that breaks down and executes complex tasks&quot;,
    ChatModel:   chatModel,
    SubAgents:   []adk.Agent{researchAgent, codeAgent},
    ToolsConfig: adk.ToolsConfig{...},
})

// Supervisor pattern: one agent coordinates multiple specialists
supervisorAgent, _ := supervisor.New(ctx, &amp;supervisor.Config{
    Supervisor: coordinatorAgent,
    SubAgents:  []adk.Agent{writerAgent, reviewerAgent},
})

// Sequential execution: agents run one after another
seqAgent, _ := adk.NewSequentialAgent(ctx, &amp;adk.SequentialAgentConfig{
    SubAgents: []adk.Agent{plannerAgent, executorAgent, summarizerAgent},
})
```

**Extensible Middleware System**: Add capabilities to agents without modifying their core logic:

```Go
fsMiddleware, _ := filesystem.NewMiddleware(ctx, &amp;filesystem.Config{
    Backend: myFileSystem,
})

agent, _ := adk.NewChatModelAgent(ctx, &amp;adk.ChatModelAgentConfig{
    // ...
    Middlewares: []adk.AgentMiddleware{fsMiddleware},
})
```

# Key Features

## Rich Components

- Encapsulates common building blocks into **component abstractions**, each have multiple **component implementations** that are ready to be used out of the box.
    - component abstractions such as ChatModel, Tool, ChatTemplate, Retriever, Document Loader, Lambda, etc.
    - each component type has an interface of its own: defined Input &amp; Output Type, defined Option type, and streaming paradigms that make sense.
    - implementations are transparent. Abstractions are all you care about when orchestrating components together.

- Implementations can be nested and captures complex business logic.
    - ReAct Agent, MultiQueryRetriever, Host MultiAgent, etc. They consist of multiple components and non-trivial business logic.
    - They are still transparent from the outside. A MultiQueryRetriever can be used anywhere that accepts a Retriever.

## Powerful Orchestration

- Data flows from Retriever / Document Loaders / ChatTemplate to ChatModel, then flows to Tools and parsed as Final Answer. This directed, controlled flow of data through multiple components can be implemented through **graph orchestration**.
- Component instances are graph nodes, and edges are data flow channels.
- Graph orchestration is powerful and flexible enough to implement complex business logic:
  - type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment are handled by the framework.
  - branch out execution at runtime, read and write global state, or do field level data mapping using workflow(currently in alpha stage).
  - **Aspects (Callbacks)** handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, tracing, and metrics. Five aspects are supported: OnStart, OnEnd, OnError, OnStartWithStreamInput, OnEndWithStreamOutput. Custom callback handlers can be added during graph run via options.

## Agent Development Kit (ADK)

While graph orchestration gives you fine-grained control, the **ADK** package provides higher-level abstractions optimized for building AI agents:

- **ChatModelAgent**: A ReAct-style agent that handles tool calling, conversation state, and the reasoning loop automatically.
- **Multi-Agent with Context Engineering**: Build hierarchical agent systems where conversation history is automatically managed across agent transfers and agent-as-tool invocations, enabling seamless context sharing between specialized agents.
- **Workflow Agents**: Compose agents using `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` for complex execution flows.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: `Interrupt` and `Resume` mechanisms with checkpoint persistence for workflows requiring human approval or input.
- **Prebuilt Patterns**: Ready-to-use implementations including Deep Agent (task orchestration), Supervisor (hierarchical coordination), and Plan-Execute-Replan.
- **Agent Middlewares**: Extensible middleware system for adding tools (filesystem operations) and managing context (token reduction).

## Complete Stream Processing

- Stream processing is important because ChatModel outputs chunks of messages in real time as it generates them. It&#039;s especially important with orchestration because more components need to handle streaming data.
- Eino automatically **concatenates** stream chunks for downstream nodes that only accepts non-stream input, such as ToolsNode.
- Eino automatically **boxes** non stream into stream when stream is needed during graph execution.  
- Eino automatically **merges** multiple streams as they converge into a single downward node.
- Eino automatically **copies** stream as they fan out to different downward node, or is passed to callback handlers.
- Orchestration elements such as **branch** and **state handlers** are also stream aware.
- With these streaming processing abilities, the streaming paradigms of components themselves become transparent to the user. 
- A compiled Graph can run with 4 different streaming paradigms:

| Streaming Paradigm | Explanation                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invoke             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns non-stream type O                     |
| Stream             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns stream type StreamReader[O]           |
| Collect            | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns non-stream type O           |
| Transform          | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns stream type StreamReader[O] |

# Overview

Cobra is a library providing a simple interface to create powerful modern CLI
interfaces similar to git &amp; go tools.

Cobra provides:
* Easy subcommand-based CLIs: `app server`, `app fetch`, etc.
* Fully POSIX-compliant flags (including short &amp; long versions)
* Nested subcommands
* Global, local and cascading flags
* Intelligent suggestions (`app srver`... did you mean `app server`?)
* Automatic help generation for commands and flags
* Grouping help for subcommands
* Automatic help flag recognition of `-h`, `--help`, etc.
* Automatically generated shell autocomplete for your application (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
* Automatically generated man pages for your application
* Command aliases so you can change things without breaking them
* The flexibility to define your own help, usage, etc.
* Optional seamless integration with [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for 12-factor apps

# Concepts

Cobra is built on a structure of commands, arguments &amp; flags.

**Commands** represent actions, **Args** are things and **Flags** are modifiers for those actions.

The best applications read like sentences when used, and as a result, users
intuitively know how to interact with them.

The pattern to follow is
`APPNAME VERB NOUN --ADJECTIVE`
    or
`APPNAME COMMAND ARG --FLAG`.

A few good real world examples may better illustrate this point.

In the following example, &#039;server&#039; is a command, and &#039;port&#039; is a flag:

    hugo server --port=1313

In this command we are telling Git to clone the url bare.

    git clone URL --bare

## Commands

Command is the central point of the application. Each interaction that
the application supports will be contained in a Command. A command can
have children commands and optionally run an action.

In the example above, &#039;server&#039; is the command.

[More about cobra.Command](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra#Command)

## Flags

A flag is a way to modify the behavior of a command. Cobra supports
fully POSIX-compliant flags as well as the Go [flag package](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/).
A Cobra command can define flags that persist through to children commands
and flags that are only available to that command.

In the example above, &#039;port&#039; is the flag.

Flag functionality is provided by the [pflag
library](https://github.com/spf13/pflag), a fork of the flag standard library
which maintains the same interface while adding POSIX compliance.

# Installing
Using Cobra is easy. First, use `go get` to install the latest version
of the library.

```
go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra@latest
```

Next, include Cobra in your application:

```go
import &quot;github.com/spf13/cobra&quot;
```

# Usage
`cobra-cli` is a command line program to generate cobra applications and command files.
It will bootstrap your application scaffolding to rapidly
develop a Cobra-based application. It is the easiest way to incorporate Cobra into your application.

It can be installed by running:

```
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

For complete details on using the Cobra-CLI generator, please read [The Cobra Generator README](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/blob/main/README.md)

----

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who&#039;s involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

----

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

## To start developing K8s

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```

For the full story, head over to the [developer&#039;s documentation].

Starting with [v4.0.0](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
this project adds Go module support, but maintains backward compatibility with
older `v3.x.y` tags and upstream `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go`. See the
[`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for more information. Version
v5.0.0 introduces major improvements to the validation of tokens, but is not
entirely backward compatible. 

&gt; After the original author of the library suggested migrating the maintenance
&gt; of `jwt-go`, a dedicated team of open source maintainers decided to clone the
&gt; existing library into this repository. See
&gt; [dgrijalva/jwt-go#462](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go/issues/462) for a
&gt; detailed discussion on this topic.


**SECURITY NOTICE:** Some older versions of Go have a security issue in the
crypto/elliptic. The recommendation is to upgrade to at least 1.15 See issue
[dgrijalva/jwt-go#216](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go/issues/216) for more
detail.

**SECURITY NOTICE:** It&#039;s important that you [validate the `alg` presented is
what you
expect](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/).
This library attempts to make it easy to do the right thing by requiring key
types to match the expected alg, but you should take the extra step to verify it in
your usage.  See the examples provided.

### Supported Go versions

Our support of Go versions is aligned with Go&#039;s [version release
policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy). So we will support a major
version of Go until there are two newer major releases. We no longer support
building jwt-go with unsupported Go versions, as these contain security
vulnerabilities that will not be fixed.

## What the heck is a JWT?

JWT.io has [a great introduction](https://jwt.io/introduction) to JSON Web
Tokens.

In short, it&#039;s a signed JSON object that does something useful (for example,
authentication).  It&#039;s commonly used for `Bearer` tokens in Oauth 2.  A token is
made of three parts, separated by `.`&#039;s.  The first two parts are JSON objects,
that have been [base64url](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648)
encoded.  The last part is the signature, encoded the same way.

The first part is called the header.  It contains the necessary information for
verifying the last part, the signature.  For example, which encryption method
was used for signing and what key was used.

The part in the middle is the interesting bit.  It&#039;s called the Claims and
contains the actual stuff you care about.  Refer to [RFC
7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) for information about
reserved keys and the proper way to add your own.

## What&#039;s in the box?

This library supports the parsing and verification as well as the generation and
signing of JWTs.  Current supported signing algorithms are HMAC SHA, RSA,
RSA-PSS, and ECDSA, though hooks are present for adding your own.

## Installation Guidelines

1. To install the jwt package, you first need to have
   [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed, then you can use the command
   below to add `jwt-go` as a dependency in your Go program.

```sh
go get -u github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5
```

2. Import it in your code:

```go
import &quot;github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5&quot;
```

## Usage

A detailed usage guide, including how to sign and verify tokens can be found on
our [documentation website](https://golang-jwt.github.io/jwt/usage/create/).

## Examples

See [the project documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5)
for examples of usage:

* [Simple example of parsing and validating a
  token](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5#example-Parse-Hmac)
* [Simple example of building and signing a
  token](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5#example-New-Hmac)
* [Directory of
  Examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5#pkg-examples)

## Compliance

This library was last reviewed to comply with [RFC
7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) dated May 2015 with a few
notable differences:

* In order to protect against accidental use of [Unsecured
  JWTs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-6), tokens using
  `alg=none` will only be accepted if the constant
  `jwt.UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType` is provided as the key.

## Project Status &amp; Versioning

This library is considered production ready.  Feedback and feature requests are
appreciated.  The API should be considered stable.  There should be very few
backward-incompatible changes outside of major version updates (and only with
good reason).

This project uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org).  Accepted pull
requests will land on `main`.  Periodically, versions will be tagged from
`main`.  You can find all the releases on [the project releases
page](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/releases).

**BREAKING CHANGES:** A full list of breaking changes is available in
`VERSION_HISTORY.md`.  See [`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for more information on updating
your code.

## Extensions

This library publishes all the necessary components for adding your own signing
methods or key functions.  Simply implement the `SigningMethod` interface and
register a factory method using `RegisterSigningMethod` or provide a
`jwt.Keyfunc`.

A common use case would be integrating with different 3rd party signature
providers, like key management services from various cloud providers or Hardware
Security Modules (HSMs) or to implement additional standards.

Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

* Documentation and Tutorials: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul]
* Forum: [Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/consul)

Consul provides several key features:

* **Multi-Datacenter** - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can
  support any number of regions without complex configuration.

* **Service Mesh** - Consul Service Mesh enables secure service-to-service
  communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Applications
  can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS
  connections for inbound and outbound connections with Transparent Proxy.

* **API Gateway** - Consul API Gateway manages access to services within Consul Service Mesh, 
  allow users to define traffic and authorization policies to services deployed within the mesh.  

* **Service Discovery** - Consul makes it simple for services to register
  themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface.
  External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.

* **Health Checking** - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert
  operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service
  discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service
  level circuit breakers.

* **Dynamic App Configuration** - An HTTP API that allows users to store indexed objects within Consul,
  for storing configuration parameters and application metadata.

Consul runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows and includes an
optional [browser based UI](https://demo.consul.io). A commercial version
called [Consul Enterprise](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/enterprise) is also
available.

**Please note**: We take Consul&#039;s security and our users&#039; trust very seriously. If you
believe you have found a security issue in Consul, please [responsibly disclose](https://www.hashicorp.com/security#vulnerability-reporting)

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Logrus &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/hTeVwmJ.png&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;40&quot; alt=&quot;:walrus:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; title=&quot;:walrus:&quot;/&gt; [![Build Status](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/sirupsen/logrus.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sirupsen/logrus)

Logrus is a structured logger for Go (golang), completely API compatible with
the standard library logger.

**Logrus is in maintenance-mode.** We will not be introducing new features. It&#039;s
simply too hard to do in a way that won&#039;t break many people&#039;s projects, which is
the last thing you want from your Logging library (again...).

This does not mean Logrus is dead. Logrus will continue to be maintained for
security, (backwards compatible) bug fixes, and performance (where we are
limited by the interface).

I believe Logrus&#039; biggest contribution is to have played a part in today&#039;s
widespread use of structured logging in Golang. There doesn&#039;t seem to be a
reason to do a major, breaking iteration into Logrus V2, since the fantastic Go
community has built those independently. Many fantastic alternatives have sprung
up. Logrus would look like those, had it been re-designed with what we know
about structured logging in Go today. Check out, for example,
[Zerolog][zerolog], [Zap][zap], and [Apex][apex].

[zerolog]: https://github.com/rs/zerolog
[zap]: https://github.com/uber-go/zap
[apex]: https://github.com/apex/log

**Seeing weird case-sensitive problems?** It&#039;s in the past been possible to
import Logrus as both upper- and lower-case. Due to the Go package environment,
this caused issues in the community and we needed a standard. Some environments
experienced problems with the upper-case variant, so the lower-case was decided.
Everything using `logrus` will need to use the lower-case:
`github.com/sirupsen/logrus`. Any package that isn&#039;t, should be changed.

To fix Glide, see [these
comments](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/553#issuecomment-306591437).
For an in-depth explanation of the casing issue, see [this
comment](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/570#issuecomment-313933276).

Nicely color-coded in development (when a TTY is attached, otherwise just
plain text):

![Colored](http://i.imgur.com/PY7qMwd.png)

With `logrus.SetFormatter(&amp;logrus.JSONFormatter{})`, for easy parsing by logstash
or Splunk:

```text
{&quot;animal&quot;:&quot;walrus&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;A group of walrus emerges from the
ocean&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:10,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562264131 -0400 EDT&quot;}

{&quot;level&quot;:&quot;warning&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;The group&#039;s number increased tremendously!&quot;,
&quot;number&quot;:122,&quot;omg&quot;:true,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562471297 -0400 EDT&quot;}

{&quot;animal&quot;:&quot;walrus&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;A giant walrus appears!&quot;,
&quot;size&quot;:10,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562500591 -0400 EDT&quot;}

{&quot;animal&quot;:&quot;walrus&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;Tremendously sized cow enters the ocean.&quot;,
&quot;size&quot;:9,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562527896 -0400 EDT&quot;}

{&quot;level&quot;:&quot;fatal&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;The ice breaks!&quot;,&quot;number&quot;:100,&quot;omg&quot;:true,
&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562543128 -0400 EDT&quot;}
```

With the default `logrus.SetFormatter(&amp;logrus.TextFormatter{})` when a TTY is not
attached, the output is compatible with the
[logfmt](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kr/logfmt) format:

```text
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=debug msg=&quot;Started observing beach&quot; animal=walrus number=8
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=info msg=&quot;A group of walrus emerges from the ocean&quot; animal=walrus size=10
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=warning msg=&quot;The group&#039;s number increased tremendously!&quot; number=122 omg=true
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=debug msg=&quot;Temperature changes&quot; temperature=-4
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=panic msg=&quot;It&#039;s over 9000!&quot; animal=orca size=9009
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=fatal msg=&quot;The ice breaks!&quot; err=&amp;{0x2082280c0 map[animal:orca size:9009] 2015-03-26 01:27:38.441574009 -0400 EDT panic It&#039;s over 9000!} number=100 omg=true
```
To ensure this behaviour even if a TTY is attached, set your formatter as follows:

```go
logrus.SetFormatter(&amp;logrus.TextFormatter{
    DisableColors: true,
    FullTimestamp: true,
})
```

#### Logging Method Name

If you wish to add the calling method as a field, instruct the logger via:

```go
logrus.SetReportCaller(true)
```
This adds the caller as &#039;method&#039; like so:

```json
{&quot;animal&quot;:&quot;penguin&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;fatal&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;github.com/sirupsen/arcticcreatures.migrate&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;a penguin swims by&quot;,
&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562543129 -0400 EDT&quot;}
```

```text
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=fatal method=github.com/sirupsen/arcticcreatures.migrate msg=&quot;a penguin swims by&quot; animal=penguin
```
Note that this does add measurable overhead - the cost will depend on the version of Go, but is
between 20 and 40% in recent tests with 1.6 and 1.7.  You can validate this in your
environment via benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.*CallerTracing
```

#### Case-sensitivity

The organization&#039;s name was changed to lower-case--and this will not be changed
back. If you are getting import conflicts due to case sensitivity, please use
the lower-case import: `github.com/sirupsen/logrus`.

#### Example

The simplest way to use Logrus is simply the package-level exported logger:

```go
package main

import &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;

func main() {
  logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
    &quot;animal&quot;: &quot;walrus&quot;,
  }).Info(&quot;A walrus appears&quot;)
}
```

Note that it&#039;s completely api-compatible with the stdlib logger, so you can
replace your `log` imports everywhere with `log &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;`
and you&#039;ll now have the flexibility of Logrus. You can customize it all you
want:

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;os&quot;

  log &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
)

func init() {
  // Log as JSON instead of the default ASCII formatter.
  log.SetFormatter(&amp;log.JSONFormatter{})

  // Output to stdout instead of the default stderr
  // Can be any io.Writer, see below for File example
  log.SetOutput(os.Stdout)

  // Only log the warning severity or above.
  log.SetLevel(log.WarnLevel)
}

func main() {
  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;animal&quot;: &quot;walrus&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;:   10,
  }).Info(&quot;A group of walrus emerges from the ocean&quot;)

  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;omg&quot;:    true,
    &quot;number&quot;: 122,
  }).Warn(&quot;The group&#039;s number increased tremendously!&quot;)

  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;omg&quot;:    true,
    &quot;number&quot;: 100,
  }).Fatal(&quot;The ice breaks!&quot;)

  // A common pattern is to re-use fields between logging statements by re-using
  // the logrus.Entry returned from WithFields()
  contextLogger := log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;common&quot;: &quot;this is a common field&quot;,
    &quot;other&quot;: &quot;I also should be logged always&quot;,
  })

  contextLogger.Info(&quot;I&#039;ll be logged with common and other field&quot;)
  contextLogger.Info(&quot;Me too&quot;)
}
```

For more advanced usage such as logging to multiple locations from the same
application, you can also create an instance of the `logrus` Logger:

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;os&quot;

  &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
)

// Create a new instance of the logger. You can have any number of instances.
var logger = logrus.New()

func main() {
  // The API for setting attributes is a little different than the package level
  // exported logger. See Godoc. 
  logger.Out = os.Stdout

  // You could set this to any `io.Writer` such as a file
  // file, err := os.OpenFile(&quot;logrus.log&quot;, os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
  // if err == nil {
  //  logger.Out = file
  // } else {
  //  logger.Info(&quot;Failed to log to file, using default stderr&quot;)
  // }

  logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
    &quot;animal&quot;: &quot;walrus&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;:   10,
  }).Info(&quot;A group of walrus emerges from the ocean&quot;)
}
```

#### Fields

Logrus encourages careful, structured logging through logging fields instead of
long, unparseable error messages. For example, instead of: `logrus.Fatalf(&quot;Failed
to send event %s to topic %s with key %d&quot;)`, you should log the much more
discoverable:

```go
logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
  &quot;event&quot;: event,
  &quot;topic&quot;: topic,
  &quot;key&quot;: key,
}).Fatal(&quot;Failed to send event&quot;)
```

We&#039;ve found this API forces you to think about logging in a way that produces
much more useful logging messages. We&#039;ve been in countless situations where just
a single added field to a log statement that was already there would&#039;ve saved us
hours. The `WithFields` call is optional.

In general, with Logrus using any of the `printf`-family functions should be
seen as a hint you should add a field, however, you can still use the
`printf`-family functions with Logrus.

#### Default Fields

Often it&#039;s helpful to have fields _always_ attached to log statements in an
application or parts of one. For example, you may want to always log the
`request_id` and `user_ip` in the context of a request. Instead of writing
`logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{&quot;request_id&quot;: request_id, &quot;user_ip&quot;: user_ip})` on
every line, you can create a `logrus.Entry` to pass around instead:

```go
requestLogger := logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{&quot;request_id&quot;: request_id, &quot;user_ip&quot;: user_ip})
requestLogger.Info(&quot;something happened on that request&quot;) // will log request_id and user_ip
requestLogger.Warn(&quot;something not great happened&quot;)
```

#### Hooks

You can add hooks for logging levels. For example to send errors to an exception
tracking service on `Error`, `Fatal` and `Panic`, info to StatsD or log to
multiple places simultaneously, e.g. syslog.

Logrus comes with [built-in hooks](hooks/). Add those, or your custom hook, in
`init`:

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;log/syslog&quot;

  &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
  airbrake &quot;gopkg.in/gemnasium/logrus-airbrake-hook.v2&quot;
  logrus_syslog &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus/hooks/syslog&quot;
)

func init() {

  // Use the Airbrake hook to report errors that have Error severity or above to
  // an exception tracker. You can create custom hooks, see the Hooks section.
  logrus.AddHook(airbrake.NewHook(123, &quot;xyz&quot;, &quot;production&quot;))

  hook, err := logrus_syslog.NewSyslogHook(&quot;udp&quot;, &quot;localhost:514&quot;, syslog.LOG_INFO, &quot;&quot;)
  if err != nil {
    logrus.Error(&quot;Unable to connect to local syslog daemon&quot;)
  } else {
    logrus.AddHook(hook)
  }
}
```
Note: Syslog hooks also support connecting to local syslog (Ex. &quot;/dev/log&quot; or &quot;/var/run/syslog&quot; or &quot;/var/run/log&quot;). For the detail, please check the [syslog hook README](hooks/syslog/README.md).

A list of currently known service hooks can be found in this wiki [page](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/wiki/Hooks)


#### Level logging

Logrus has seven logging levels: Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal and Panic.

```go
logrus.Trace(&quot;Something very low level.&quot;)
logrus.Debug(&quot;Useful debugging information.&quot;)
logrus.Info(&quot;Something noteworthy happened!&quot;)
logrus.Warn(&quot;You should probably take a look at this.&quot;)
logrus.Error(&quot;Something failed but I&#039;m not quitting.&quot;)
// Calls os.Exit(1) after logging
logrus.Fatal(&quot;Bye.&quot;)
// Calls panic() after logging
logrus.Panic(&quot;I&#039;m bailing.&quot;)
```

You can set the logging level on a `Logger`, then it will only log entries with
that severity or anything above it:

```go
// Will log anything that is info or above (warn, error, fatal, panic). Default.
logrus.SetLevel(logrus.InfoLevel)
```

It may be useful to set `logrus.Level = logrus.DebugLevel` in a debug or verbose
environment if your application has that.

Note: If you want different log levels for global (`logrus.SetLevel(...)`) and syslog logging, please check the [syslog hook README](hooks/syslog/README.md#different-log-levels-for-local-and-remote-logging).

#### Entries

Besides the fields added with `WithField` or `WithFields` some fields are
automatically added to all logging events:

1. `time`. The timestamp when the entry was created.
2. `msg`. The logging message passed to `{Info,Warn,Error,Fatal,Panic}` after
   the `AddFields` call. E.g. `Failed to send event.`
3. `level`. The logging level. E.g. `info`.

#### Environments

Logrus has no notion of environment.

If you wish for hooks and formatters to only be used in specific environments,
you should handle that yourself. For example, if your application has a global
variable `Environment`, which is a string representation of the environment you
could do:

```go
import (
  &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
)

func init() {
  // do something here to set environment depending on an environment variable
  // or command-line flag
  if Environment == &quot;production&quot; {
    logrus.SetFormatter(&amp;logrus.JSONFormatter{})
  } else {
    // The TextFormatter is default, you don&#039;t actually have to do this.
    logrus.SetFormatter(&amp;logrus.TextFormatter{})
  }
}
```

This configuration is how `logrus` was intended to be used, but JSON in
production is mostly only useful if you do log aggregation with tools like
Splunk or Logstash.

#### Formatters

The built-in logging formatters are:

* `logrus.TextFormatter`. Logs the event in colors if stdout is a tty, otherwise
  without colors.
  * *Note:* to force colored output when there is no TTY, set the `ForceColors`
    field to `true`.  To force no colored output even if there is a TTY  set the
    `DisableColors` field to `true`. For Windows, see
    [github.com/mattn/go-colorable](https://github.com/mattn/go-colorable).
  * When colors are enabled, levels are truncated to 4 characters by default. To disable
    truncation set the `DisableLevelTruncation` field to `true`.
  * When outputting to a TTY, it&#039;s often helpful to visually scan down a column where all the levels are the same width. Setting the `PadLevelText` field to `true` enables this behavior, by adding padding to the level text.
  * All options are listed in the [generated docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sirupsen/logrus#TextFormatter).
* `logrus.JSONFormatter`. Logs fields as JSON.
  * All options are listed in the [generated docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sirupsen/logrus#JSONFormatter).

Third-party logging formatters:

* [`FluentdFormatter`](https://github.com/joonix/log). Formats entries that can be parsed by Kubernetes and Google Container Engine.
* [`GELF`](https://github.com/fabienm/go-logrus-formatters). Formats entries so they comply to Graylog&#039;s [GELF 1.1 specification](http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.4/pages/gelf.html).
* [`logstash`](https://github.com/bshuster-repo/logrus-logstash-hook). Logs fields as [Logstash](http://logstash.net) Events.
* [`prefixed`](https://github.com/x-cray/logrus-prefixed-formatter). Displays log entry source along with alternative layout.
* [`zalgo`](https://github.com/aybabtme/logzalgo). Invoking the Power of Zalgo.
* [`nested-logrus-formatter`](https://github.com/antonfisher/nested-logrus-formatter). Converts logrus fields to a nested structure.
* [`powerful-logrus-formatter`](https://github.com/zput/zxcTool). get fileName, log&#039;s line number and the latest function&#039;s name when print log; Save log to files.
* [`caption-json-formatter`](https://github.com/nolleh/caption_json_formatter). logrus&#039;s message json formatter with human-readable caption added.

You can define your formatter by implementing the `Formatter` interface,
requiring a `Format` method. `Format` takes an `*Entry`. `entry.Data` is a
`Fields` type (`map[string]interface{}`) with all your fields as well as the
default ones (see Entries section above):

```go
type MyJSONFormatter struct{}

logrus.SetFormatter(new(MyJSONFormatter))

func (f *MyJSONFormatter) Format(entry *Entry) ([]byte, error) {
  // Note this doesn&#039;t include Time, Level and Message which are available on
  // the Entry. Consult `godoc` on information about those fields or read the
  // source of the official loggers.
  serialized, err := json.Marshal(entry.Data)
    if err != nil {
      return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;Failed to marshal fields to JSON, %w&quot;, err)
    }
  return append(serialized, &#039;\n&#039;), nil
}
```

#### Logger as an `io.Writer`

Logrus can be transformed into an `io.Writer`. That writer is the end of an `io.Pipe` and it is your responsibility to close it.

```go
w := logger.Writer()
defer w.Close()

srv := http.Server{
    // create a stdlib log.Logger that writes to
    // logrus.Logger.
    ErrorLog: log.New(w, &quot;&quot;, 0),
}
```

Each line written to that writer will be printed the usual way, using formatters
and hooks. The level for those entries is `info`.

This means that we can override the standard library logger easily:

```go
logger := logrus.New()
logger.Formatter = &amp;logrus.JSONFormatter{}

// Use logrus for standard log output
// Note that `log` here references stdlib&#039;s log
// Not logrus imported under the name `log`.
log.SetOutput(logger.Writer())
```

#### Rotation

Log rotation is not provided with Logrus. Log rotation should be done by an
external program (like `logrotate(8)`) that can compress and delete old log
entries. It should not be a feature of the application-level logger.

#### Tools

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
|[Logrus Mate](https://github.com/gogap/logrus_mate)|Logrus mate is a tool for Logrus to manage loggers, you can initial logger&#039;s level, hook and formatter by config file, the logger will be generated with different configs in different environments.|
|[Logrus Viper Helper](https://github.com/heirko/go-contrib/tree/master/logrusHelper)|An Helper around Logrus to wrap with spf13/Viper to load configuration with fangs! And to simplify Logrus configuration use some behavior of [Logrus Mate](https://github.com/gogap/logrus_mate). [sample](https://github.com/heirko/iris-contrib/blob/master/middleware/logrus-logger/example) |

#### Testing

Logrus has a built-in facility for asserting the presence of log messages. This is implemented through the `test` hook and provides:

* decorators for existing logger (`test.NewLocal` and `test.NewGlobal`) which basically just adds the `test` hook
* a test logger (`test.NewNullLogger`) that just records log messages (and does not output any):

```go
import(
  &quot;testing&quot;

  &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
  &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus/hooks/test&quot;
  &quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)

func TestSomething(t*testing.T){
  logger, hook := test.NewNullLogger()
  logger.Error(&quot;Helloerror&quot;)

  assert.Equal(t, 1, len(hook.Entries))
  assert.Equal(t, logrus.ErrorLevel, hook.LastEntry().Level)
  assert.Equal(t, &quot;Helloerror&quot;, hook.LastEntry().Message)

  hook.Reset()
  assert.Nil(t, hook.LastEntry())
}
```

#### Fatal handlers

Logrus can register one or more functions that will be called when any `fatal`
level message is logged. The registered handlers will be executed before
logrus performs an `os.Exit(1)`. This behavior may be helpful if callers need
to gracefully shut down. Unlike a `panic(&quot;Something went wrong...&quot;)` call which can be intercepted with a deferred `recover` a call to `os.Exit(1)` can not be intercepted.

```go
// ...
handler := func() {
  // gracefully shut down something...
}
logrus.RegisterExitHandler(handler)
// ...
```

#### Thread safety

By default, Logger is protected by a mutex for concurrent writes. The mutex is held when calling hooks and writing logs.
If you are sure such locking is not needed, you can call logger.SetNoLock() to disable the locking.

Situations when locking is not needed include:

* You have no hooks registered, or hooks calling is already thread-safe.

* Writing to logger.Out is already thread-safe, for example:

  1) logger.Out is protected by locks.

  2) logger.Out is an os.File handler opened with `O_APPEND` flag, and every write is smaller than 4k. (This allows multi-thread/multi-process writing)

# OpenCost — your favorite open source cost monitoring tool for Kubernetes and cloud spend

OpenCost give teams visibility into current and historical Kubernetes and cloud spend and resource allocation.
These models provide cost transparency in Kubernetes environments that support multiple applications, teams, departments, etc.
It also provides visibility into the cloud costs across multiple providers.

OpenCost was originally developed and open sourced by [Kubecost](https://kubecost.com). This project combines a [specification](/spec/) as well as a Golang implementation of these detailed requirements. The web UI is available in the [opencost/opencost-ui](http://github.com/opencost/opencost-ui) repository.

[![OpenCost UI Walkthrough](./ui/src/thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/lCP4Ci9Kcdg)
*OpenCost UI Walkthrough*

To see the full functionality of OpenCost you can view [OpenCost features](https://opencost.io). Here is a summary of features enabled:

- Real-time cost allocation by Kubernetes cluster, node, namespace, controller kind, controller, service, or pod
- Multi-cloud cost monitoring for all cloud services on AWS, Azure, GCP
- Dynamic on-demand k8s asset pricing enabled by integrations with AWS, Azure, and GCP billing APIs
- Supports on-prem k8s clusters with custom CSV pricing
- Allocation for in-cluster K8s resources like CPU, GPU, memory, and persistent volumes
- Easily export pricing data to Prometheus with /metrics endpoint ([learn more](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/prometheus))
- Carbon costs for cloud resources
- MCP support
- Support for external costs like Datadog through [OpenCost Plugins](https://github.com/opencost/opencost-plugins)
- Free and open source distribution ([Apache2 license](LICENSE))

## Getting Started

OpenCost is now installed and managed via the official Helm chart only.

Quick install on any Kubernetes 1.20+ cluster:

```bash
helm repo add opencost https://opencost.github.io/opencost-helm-chart
helm repo update
helm install opencost opencost/opencost
```

Note: The standalone Kubernetes manifest files have been removed. Please use Helm for all installations and upgrades. See the [Helm installation docs](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/install) for details and configuration.

&gt; **Note for sharded Prometheus users:**
&gt; If you run Prometheus in a sharded (HA) setup, set `PROMETHEUS_SERVER_ENDPOINT` to a global query endpoint (e.g., Thanos Query, Cortex, or Mimir). Pointing to a single Prometheus pod may result in incomplete or intermittent export results. See the [Prometheus integration docs](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/prometheus) for details.

## Usage

- [Cost APIs](https://www.opencost.io/docs/integrations/api)
- [CLI / kubectl cost](https://www.opencost.io/docs/integrations/kubectl-cost)
- [Prometheus Metrics](https://www.opencost.io/docs/integrations/prometheus)
- [User Interface](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/ui)

## MCP Server

The OpenCost MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides AI agents with access to cost allocation and asset data through a standardized interface. The MCP server is **enabled by default** in all OpenCost deployments, runs on port 8081, and is **built into the Helm chart** for easy production deployment. Users have full control to disable it or configure custom ports and settings.

### Features

- **Enabled by Default**: MCP server starts automatically with OpenCost
- **Full User Control**: Easy to disable or configure port and settings
- **Allocation Queries**: Retrieve cost allocation data with filtering and aggregation
- **Asset Queries**: Access detailed asset information including nodes, disks, load balancers, and more
- **Cloud Cost Queries**: Query cloud cost data with provider, service, and region filtering
- **HTTP Transport**: Uses HTTP for reliable communication with MCP clients
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with default OpenCost deployment
- **Helm Integration**: Built into the official Helm chart for production deployments

### Quick Start

#### Using Tilt (Development)
```bash
# Clone and start OpenCost with MCP server
git clone https://github.com/opencost/opencost.git
cd opencost
tilt up
```

Tilt configuration notes (cloud costs):

OpenCost&#039;s Tilt values (`tilt-values.yaml`) include extra environment variables to enable Cloud Cost ingestion in dev:

```yaml
# tilt-values.yaml (excerpt)
opencost:
  exporter:
    extraEnv:
      CLOUD_COST_ENABLED: &quot;true&quot;
      CLOUD_COST_CONFIG_PATH: &quot;/var/cloud-integration/cloud-integration.json&quot;
```

- Set `CLOUD_COST_ENABLED` to &quot;true&quot; to turn on cloud cost ingestion.
- Point `CLOUD_COST_CONFIG_PATH` to the mounted cloud integration file used by Tilt (e.g., `/var/cloud-integration/cloud-integration.json`).
- Adjust other values in `tilt-values.yaml` as needed during development.

#### Using Helm (Production)
```bash
# Add the OpenCost Helm repository
helm repo add opencost https://opencost.github.io/opencost-helm-chart
helm repo update

# Deploy OpenCost with MCP server (enabled by default)
helm install opencost opencost/opencost

# Access MCP server via port forwarding (example)
kubectl port-forward svc/opencost 8081:8081
```

The MCP server is **enabled by default** in the Helm chart. For custom configuration:

```bash
# Deploy with MCP server disabled
helm install opencost opencost/opencost \
  --set opencost.mcp.enabled=false

# Deploy with custom MCP port
helm install opencost opencost/opencost \
  --set opencost.mcp.port=9091

# Deploy with debug logging
helm install opencost opencost/opencost \
  --set opencost.mcp.extraEnv.MCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

#### Configuration Summary

| Configuration | Command | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Default** | `helm install opencost opencost/opencost` | MCP enabled on port 8081 |
| **Disable** | `--set opencost.mcp.enabled=false` | Completely disable MCP server |
| **Custom Port** | `--set opencost.mcp.port=9091` | Use different port |
| **Debug Mode** | `--set opencost.mcp.extraEnv.MCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug` | Enable debug logging |

### MCP Client Configuration

Configure your MCP client (e.g., Cursor) to connect to the OpenCost MCP server:

**Default configuration (port 8081):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;opencost&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8081&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

**Custom port configuration:**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;opencost&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:9091&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

**For Kubernetes deployments:**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;opencost&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://opencost.opencost.svc.cluster.local:8081&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

**For external access (with LoadBalancer/Ingress):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;opencost&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://your-opencost-domain.com:8081&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

*go-git* is a highly extensible git implementation library written in **pure Go**.

It can be used to manipulate git repositories at low level *(plumbing)* or high level *(porcelain)*, through an idiomatic Go API. It also supports several types of storage, such as in-memory filesystems, or custom implementations, thanks to the [`Storer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v6/plumbing/storer) interface.

It&#039;s being actively developed since 2015 and is being used extensively by [Keybase](https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone), [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) or [Pulumi](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apulumi+go-git&amp;type=Code), and by many other libraries and tools.

After the [legal issues](https://github.com/src-d/go-git/issues/1295#issuecomment-592965250) with the [`src-d`](https://github.com/src-d) organization, the lack of update for four months and the requirement to make a hard fork, the project is **now back to normality**.

The project is currently actively maintained by individual contributors, including several of the original authors, but also backed by a new company, [gitsight](https://github.com/gitsight), where `go-git` is a critical component used at scale.


Comparison with git
-------------------

*go-git* aims to be fully compatible with [git](https://github.com/git/git), all the *porcelain* operations are implemented to work exactly as *git* does.

*git* is a humongous project with years of development by thousands of contributors, making it challenging for *go-git* to implement all the features. You can find a comparison of *go-git* vs *git* in the [compatibility documentation](COMPATIBILITY.md).


Installation
------------

The recommended way to install *go-git* is:

```go
import &quot;github.com/go-git/go-git/v6&quot; // with go modules enabled (GO111MODULE=on or outside GOPATH)
import &quot;github.com/go-git/go-git&quot; // with go modules disabled
```


Examples
--------

&gt; Please note that the `CheckIfError` and `Info` functions  used in the examples are from the [examples package](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/blob/master/_examples/common.go#L19) just to be used in the examples.


### Basic example

A basic example that mimics the standard `git clone` command

```go
// Clone the given repository to the given directory
Info(&quot;git clone https://github.com/go-git/go-git&quot;)

_, err := git.PlainClone(&quot;/tmp/foo&quot;, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
    URL:      &quot;https://github.com/go-git/go-git&quot;,
    Progress: os.Stdout,
})

CheckIfError(err)
```

Outputs:
```
Counting objects: 4924, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (1333/1333), done.
Total 4924 (delta 530), reused 6 (delta 6), pack-reused 3533
```

### In-memory example

Cloning a repository into memory and printing the history of HEAD, just like `git log` does


```go
// Clones the given repository in memory, creating the remote, the local
// branches and fetching the objects, exactly as:
Info(&quot;git clone https://github.com/go-git/go-billy&quot;)

r, err := git.Clone(memory.NewStorage(), nil, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
    URL: &quot;https://github.com/go-git/go-billy&quot;,
})

CheckIfError(err)

// Gets the HEAD history from HEAD, just like this command:
Info(&quot;git log&quot;)

// ... retrieves the branch pointed by HEAD
ref, err := r.Head()
CheckIfError(err)


// ... retrieves the commit history
cIter, err := r.Log(&amp;git.LogOptions{From: ref.Hash()})
CheckIfError(err)

// ... just iterates over the commits, printing it
err = cIter.ForEach(func(c *object.Commit) error {
	fmt.Println(c)
	return nil
})
CheckIfError(err)
```

Outputs:
```
