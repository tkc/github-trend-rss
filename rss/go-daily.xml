&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Installation

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose using provided directory structure (recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a new directory called `glance` as well as the template files within it by running:

```bash
mkdir glance &amp;&amp; cd glance &amp;&amp; curl -sL https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xzf - --strip-components 2
```

*[click here to view the files that will be created](https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/tree/main/root)*

Then, edit the following files as desired:
* `docker-compose.yml` to configure the port, volumes and other containery things
* `config/home.yml` to configure the widgets or layout of the home page
* `config/glance.yml` if you want to change the theme or add more pages

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Other files you may want to edit&lt;/summary&gt;

* `.env` to configure environment variables that will be available inside configuration files
* `assets/user.css` to add custom CSS
&lt;/details&gt;

When ready, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose manual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  glance:
    container_name: glance
    image: glanceapp/glance
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Then, create a new directory called `config` and download the example starting [`glance.yml`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/glance.yml) file into it by running:

```bash
mkdir config &amp;&amp; wget -O config/glance.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

Feel free to edit the `glance.yml` file to your liking, and when ready run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker logs glance
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual binary installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Precompiled binaries are available for Linux, Windows and macOS (x86, x86_64, ARM and ARM64 architectures).

### Linux

Visit the [latest release page](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) for available binaries. You can place the binary in `/opt/glance/` and have it start with your server via a [systemd service](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/). By default, when running the binary, it will look for a `glance.yml` file in the directory it&#039;s placed in. To specify a different path for the config file, use the `--config` option:

```bash
/opt/glance/glance --config /etc/glance.yml
```

To grab a starting template for the config file, run:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

### Windows

Download and extract the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) (most likely the file called `glance-windows-amd64.zip` if you&#039;re on a 64-bit system) and place it in a folder of your choice. Then, create a new text file called `glance.yml` in the same folder and paste the content from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml) in it. You should then be able to run the executable and access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.



&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Glance can also be installed through the following 3rd party channels:
* [Proxmox VE Helper Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=glance)
* [NixOS package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&amp;show=glance)
* [Coolify.io](https://coolify.io/docs/services/glance/)

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Building from source

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build binary with Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) &gt;= v1.23

To build the project for your current OS and architecture, run:

```bash
go build -o build/glance .
```

To build for a specific OS and architecture, run:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/glance .
```

[*click here for a full list of GOOS and GOARCH combinations*](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#:~:text=$GOOS%20and%20$GOARCH)

Alternatively, if you just want to run the app without creating a binary, like when you&#039;re testing out changes, you can run:

```bash
go run .
```
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build project and Docker image with Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To build the project and image using just Docker, run:

*(replace `owner` with your name or organization)*

```bash
docker build -t owner/glance:latest .
```

If you wish to push the image to a registry (by default Docker Hub), run:

```bash
docker push owner/glance:latest
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## FAQ
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the information on the page update automatically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No, a page refresh is required to update the information. Some things do dynamically update where it makes sense, like the clock widget and the relative time showing how long ago something happened.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequently do widgets update?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No requests are made periodically in the background, information is only fetched upon loading the page and then cached. The default cache lifetime is different for each widget and can be configured.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I create my own widgets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, there are multiple ways to create custom widgets:
* `iframe` widget - allows you to embed things from other websites
* `html` widget - allows you to insert your own static HTML
* `extension` widget - fetch HTML from a URL
* `custom-api` widget - fetch JSON from a URL and render it using custom HTML
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I change the title of a widget?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, the title of all widgets can be changed by specifying the `title` property in the widget&#039;s configuration:

```yaml
- type: rss
  title: My custom title

- type: markets
  title: My custom title

- type: videos
  title: My custom title

# and so on for all widgets...
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Feature requests

New feature suggestions are always welcome and will be considered, though please keep in mind that some of them may be out of scope for what the project is trying to achieve (or is reasonably capable of). If you have an idea for a new feature and would like to share it, you can do so [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

Feature requests are tagged with one of the following:

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/roadmap) - will be implemented in a future release
* [Backlog](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/backlog) - may be implemented in the future but needs further feedback or interest from the community
* [Icebox](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/icebox) - no plans to implement as it doesn&#039;t currently align with the project&#039;s goals or capabilities, may be revised at a later date

&lt;br&gt;

## Contributing guidelines

* Before working on a new feature it&#039;s preferable to submit a feature request first and state that you&#039;d like to implement it yourself
* Please don&#039;t submit PRs for feature requests that are either in the roadmap&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;, backlog&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; or icebox&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Use `dev` for the base branch if you&#039;re adding new features or fixing bugs, otherwise use `main`
* Avoid introducing new dependencies
* Avoid making backwards-incompatible configuration changes
* Avoid introducing new colors or hard-coding colors, use the standard `primary`, `positive` and `negative`
* For icons, try to use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) where applicable
* Provide a screenshot of the changes if UI related where possible
* No `package.json`

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1] [2] [3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

[1] The feature likely already has work put into it that may conflict with your implementation

[2] The demand, implementation or functionality for this feature is not yet clear

[3] No plans to add this feature for the time being

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

### What is DiceDB?

DiceDB is an open-source, fast, reactive, in-memory database optimized for modern hardware. Commonly used as a cache, it offers a familiar interface while enabling real-time data updates through query subscriptions. It delivers higher throughput and lower median latencies, making it ideal for modern workloads.

## Get started

### Setting up DiceDB with Docker

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```bash
$ docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb:latest
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and SDKs.

### Build from source

To build DiceDB from source, you need to have the following

1. [Golang](https://go.dev/)
2. Any of the below supported platform environments:
    1. [Linux based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)
    2. [OSX (Darwin) based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)
    3. WSL under Windows

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dicedb/dice
$ cd dice
$ make build
```

The above command will create a binary `dicedb`. Execute the binary and that will
start the DiceDB server., or, you can run the following command to run like a usual
Go program

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

You can skip passing the flag if you are not working with `.WATCH` feature.

## Setting up CLI

### Using cURL

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and you can install it by running the following command

```bash
$ sudo su
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you are working on unsupported OS (as per above script), you can always follow the installation instructions mentioned in the [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) repository.

### Building from source

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli
$ cd dicedb-cli
$ make build
```

The above command will create a binary `dicedb-cli`. Execute the binary will
start the CLI and will try to connect to the DiceDB server.

## Want to contribute?

We have multiple repositories where you can contribute. So, as per your interest, you can pick one and build a deeper understanding of the project on the go.

- [dicedb/dice](https://github.com/dicedb/dice) for core database features and engine / Stack - Go
- [dicedb/dicedb-cli](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-cli) command line interface for DiceDB / Stack - Go
- [dicedb/dicedb-go](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-go) Go Client for DiceDB

## Essentials for Development

### Pointing to local checked-out `dicedb-go`

It is advised to checkout [dicedb-go](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-go) repository also because `dice` takes
a strong dependency on it. To point to the local copy add the following line
at the end of the `go.mod` file.

```
replace github.com/dicedb/dicedb-go =&gt; ../dicedb-go
```

Note: this is the literal line that needs to be added at the end of the go.mod file.
Refer to [this article](https://thewebivore.com/using-replace-in-go-mod-to-point-to-your-local-module/), to understand what it is and why it is needed.

Do not check-in the `go.mod` file with this change.

### Install GoLangCI

```bash
$ sudo su
$ sudo curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- -b /bin v1.64.6
```

### Local Setup with Custom Config

Follow these steps to generate and customize your dicedb configuration in a local setup:

```bash
$ go run main.go config-init
```

This will generate configuration file (`dicedb.yaml`) in metadata directory.
Metadata directory is OS-specific,

 - macOS: `/usr/local/etc/dicedb/dicedb.yaml`
 - Linux: `/etc/dicedb/dicedb.yaml`

If you run with a `sudo` privileges, then these directories are used, otherwise
the current working directory is used as the metada directory.

### Running Tests

Unit tests and integration tests are essential for ensuring correctness and in the case of DiceDB, both types of tests are available to validate its functionality.

For unit testing, you can execute individual unit tests by specifying the name of the test function using the `TEST_FUNC` environment variable and running the `make unittest-one` command. Alternatively, running `make unittest` will execute all unit tests.

### Executing one unit test

```bash
TEST_FUNC=&lt;name of the test function&gt; make unittest-one
TEST_FUNC=TestByteList make unittest-one
```

### Running all unit tests

```bash
make unittest
```

Integration tests, on the other hand, involve starting up the DiceDB server and running a series of commands to verify the expected end state and output. To execute a single integration test, you can set the `TEST_FUNC` environment variable to the name of the test function and run `make test-one`. Running `make test` will execute all integration tests.

### Executing a single integration test

Make sure you have DiceDB running before you run the following commands.
By default it connects to the local instance of DiceDB running on port `7379`.

```bash
TEST_FUNC=&lt;name of the test function&gt; make test-one
TEST_FUNC=^TestSet$ make test-one
```

### Running all integration tests

```bash
$ make test
```

We use [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework to power the [dicedb.io website](https://dicedb.io) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) to power the docs. Once you have NodeJS installed, fire the following commands to get your local version of [dicedb.io](https://dicedb.io) running.

```bash
$ cd docs
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, visit http://localhost:4321/ in your favourite browser. This runs with a hot reload which means any changes you make in the website and the documentation can be instantly viewed on the browser.

### Docs directory structure

1. `docs/src/content/docs/commands` is where all the commands are documented
2. `docs/src/content/docs/tutorials` is where all the tutorials are documented

## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

**Authelia** is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single
sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. It acts as a companion for [reverse proxies](#proxy-support) by
allowing, denying, or redirecting requests.

Documentation is available at [https://www.authelia.com/](https://www.authelia.com/).

The following is a simple diagram of the architecture:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin:50px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.authelia.com/images/archi.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**Authelia** can be installed as a standalone service from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/authelia/),
[APT](https://apt.authelia.com/stable/debian/packages/authelia/),
[FreeBSD Ports](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/www/authelia/), or using a
[static binary](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest),
[.deb package](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest), as a container on [Docker] or [Kubernetes].


Deployment can be orchestrated via the Helm [Chart](https://charts.authelia.com) (beta) leveraging ingress controllers
and ingress configurations.

&lt;/p&gt;

## Features summary

This is a list of the key features of Authelia:

* Several second factor methods:
  * **[Security Keys](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authentication/security-key/)** that support
    [FIDO2]&amp;nbsp;[WebAuthn] with devices like a [YubiKey].
  * **[Time-based One-Time password](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authentication/one-time-password/)**
    with compatible authenticator applications.
  * **[Mobile Push Notifications](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authentication/push-notification/)**
    with [Duo](https://duo.com/).
* Password reset with identity verification using email confirmation.
* Access restriction after too many invalid authentication attempts.
* Fine-grained access control using rules which match criteria like subdomain, user, user group membership, request uri,
 request method, and network.
* Choice between one-factor and two-factor policies per-rule.
* Support of basic authentication for endpoints protected by the one-factor policy.
* Highly available using a remote database and Redis as a highly available KV store.
* Compatible with [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik) out of the box using the
  [ForwardAuth](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/forwardauth/) middleware.
* Curated configuration from [LinuxServer](https://www.linuxserver.io/) via their
  [SWAG](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag) container as well as a
  [guide](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2020/08/26/setting-up-authelia/).
* Compatible with [Caddy] using the [forward_auth](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/forward_auth)
  directive.
* Kubernetes Support:
  * Compatible with several Kubernetes ingress controllers:
    * [ingress-nginx](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/nginx-ingress/)
    * [Traefik Kubernetes CRD](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/traefik-ingress/#ingressroute)
    * [Traefik Kubernetes Ingress](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/traefik-ingress/#ingress)
    * [Istio](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/istio/)

&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting Started

See the [Get Started Guide](https://www.authelia.com/integration/prologue/get-started/) or one of the curated examples
below.

### docker compose

The `docker compose` bundles act as a starting point for anyone wanting to see Authelia in action. You will have to
customize them to your needs as they come with self-signed certificates.

#### [Local](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/#local)
The Local compose bundle is intended to test Authelia without worrying about configuration.
It&#039;s meant to be used for scenarios where the server is not be exposed to the internet.
Domains will be defined in the local hosts file and self-signed certificates will be utilised.

#### [Lite](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/#lite)
The Lite compose bundle is intended for scenarios where the server will be exposed to the internet, domains and DNS will
need to be setup accordingly and certificates will be generated through LetsEncrypt. The Lite element refers to minimal
external dependencies; File based user storage, SQLite based configuration storage. In this configuration, the service
will not scale well.

## Deployment

Now that you have tested **Authelia** and you want to try it out in your own infrastructure,
you can learn how to deploy and use it with [Deployment](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/introduction/).
This guide will show you how to deploy it on bare metal as well as on
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Security

Authelia takes security very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in Authelia, please see our

## Breaking changes

Since Authelia is still under active development, it is subject to breaking changes. It&#039;s recommended to pin a version
tag instead of using the `latest` tag and reading the [release notes](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases)
before upgrading. This is where you will find information about breaking changes and what you should do to overcome
said changes.

## Why Open Source?

You might wonder why Authelia is open source while it adds a great deal of security and user experience to your
infrastructure at zero cost. It is open source because we firmly believe that security should be available for all to
benefit in the face of the battlefield which is the Internet, with near zero effort.

Additionally, keeping the code open source is a way to leave it auditable by anyone who is willing to contribute. This
way, you can be confident that the product remains secure and does not act maliciously.

It&#039;s important to keep in mind Authelia is not directly exposed on the
Internet (your reverse proxies are) however, it&#039;s still the control plane for your internal security so take care of it!

If you want to contribute to Authelia, please read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# yt-dlp Web UI

A not so terrible web ui for yt-dlp. 

High performance extendeable web ui and RPC server for yt-dlp with low impact on resources.

Created for the only purpose of *fetching* videos from my server/nas and monitor upcoming livestreams. 

**Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui) or [ghcr.io](https://github.com/marcopiovanello/yt-dlp-web-ui/pkgs/container/yt-dlp-web-ui)**.

```sh
docker pull marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui
```
```sh
# latest dev
docker pull ghcr.io/marcopiovanello/yt-dlp-web-ui:latest
```

## Settings

The currently avaible settings are:
-   Server address
-   Switch theme
-   Extract audio
-   Switch language
-   Optional format selection
-   Override the output filename
-   Override the output path
-   Pass custom yt-dlp arguments safely
-   Download queue (limit concurrent downloads)

## Format selection

This feature is disabled by default as this intended to be used to retrieve the best quality automatically.

To enable it just go to the settings page and enable the **Enable video/audio formats selection** flag!

## [Docker](https://github.com/marcopiovanello/yt-dlp-web-ui/pkgs/container/yt-dlp-web-ui) run
```sh
docker pull marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui
docker run -d -p 3033:3033 -v &lt;your dir&gt;:/downloads marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui
```

Or with docker but building the container manually.

```sh
docker build -t yt-dlp-webui .
docker run -d -p 3033:3033 -v &lt;your dir&gt;:/downloads yt-dlp-webui

docker run -d -p 3033:3033 \
  -v &lt;your dir&gt;:/downloads \  
  -v &lt;your dir&gt;:/config \ # optional
  yt-dlp-webui

```

If you opt to add RPC authentication...
```sh
docker run -d \
    -p 3033:3033 \
    -e JWT_SECRET randomsecret
    -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
    -v /path/for/config:/config \ # optional
    marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui \
    --auth \
    --user your_username \
    --pass your_pass
```

If you wish for limiting the download queue size...

e.g. limiting max 2 concurrent download.
```sh
docker run -d \
    -p 3033:3033 \
    -e JWT_SECRET randomsecret
    -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
    marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui \
    --qs 2
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
services:
  yt-dlp-webui:
    image: marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui
    ports:
      - 3033:3033
    volumes:
      - &lt;your dir&gt;:/downloads # replace &lt;your dir&gt; with a directory on your host system
    healthcheck:
      test: curl -f http://localhost:3033 || exit 1
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Config file
By running `yt-dlp-webui` in standalone mode you have the ability to also specify a config file.
The config file **will overwrite what have been passed as cli argument**.
With Docker, inside the mounted `/conf` volume inside there must be a file named `config.yml`.

```yaml
# Simple configuration file for yt-dlp webui

---
# Host where server will listen at (default: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;)
#host: 0.0.0.0

# Port where server will listen at (default: 3033)
port: 8989

# Directory where downloaded files will be stored (default: &quot;.&quot;)
downloadPath: /home/ren/archive

# [optional] Enable RPC authentication (requires username and password)
require_auth: true
username: my_username
password: my_random_secret

# [optional] The download queue size (default: logical cpu cores)
queue_size: 4 # min. 2

# [optional] Full path to the yt-dlp (default: &quot;yt-dlp&quot;)
#downloaderPath: /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp

# [optional] Enable file based logging with rotation (default: false)
#enable_file_logging: false

# [optional] Directory where the log file will be stored (default: &quot;.&quot;)
#log_path: .

# [optional] Directory where the session database file will be stored (default: &quot;.&quot;)
#session_file_path: .

# [optional] Path where the sqlite database will be created/opened (default: &quot;./local.db&quot;)
#local_database_path

# [optional] Path where a custom frontend will be loaded (instead of the embedded one)
#frontend_path: ./web/solid-frontend
```

### Systemd integration
By defining a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/yt-dlp-webui.service` yt-dlp webui can be launched as in background.

```
[Unit]
Description=yt-dlp-webui service file
After=network.target

[Service]
User=some_user
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp-webui --out /mnt/share/downloads --port 8100

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```shell
systemctl enable yt-dlp-webui
systemctl start yt-dlp-webui
```
It could be that yt-dlp-webui works correctly when started manually from the console, but with systemd, it does not see the yt-dlp executable, or has issues writing to the database file. One way to fix these issues could be as follows:
```shell
cd
mkdir yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
# optionally move the already existing database file there:
mv local.db yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
nano yt-dlp-webui-workingdir/my.conf
```
The config file format is described above; make sure to include the `downloaderPath` setting (the path can possibly be found by running `which yt-dlp`). For example, one could have:
```
downloadPath: /stuff/media
downloaderPath: /home/your_user/.local/bin/yt-dlp
log_path: /home/your_user/yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
session_file_path: /home/your_user/yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
```
Adjust the Service section in the `/etc/systemd/system/yt-dlp-webui.service` file as follows:
```
[Service]
User=your_user
Group=your_user
WorkingDirectory=/home/your_user/yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp-webui --conf /home/your_user/yt-dlp-webui-workingdir/my.conf
```

## Manual installation
```sh
# the dependencies are: yt-dlp, ffmpeg, nodejs, go, make.

make all
```
## Open-API
Navigate to `/openapi` to see the related swagger.


## Extendable
You dont&#039;like the Material feel?
Want to build your own frontend? We got you covered 🤠

`yt-dlp-webui` now exposes a nice **JSON-RPC 1.0** interface through Websockets and HTTP-POST
It is **planned** to also expose a **gRPC** server.

For more information open an issue on GitHub and I will provide more info ASAP.

## Custom frontend
To load a custom frontend you need to specify its path either in the config file ([see config file](#config-file)) or via flags.

The frontend needs to follow this structure:
```
path/to/my/frontend
├── assets
│   ├── js-chunk-1.js (example)
│   ├── js-chunk-2.js (example)
│   ├── style.css (example)
└── index.html
```

`assets` is where the resources will be loaded.  
`index.html` is the entrypoint.

## Nix
This repo adds support for Nix(OS) in various ways through a `flake-parts` flake. 
For more info, please refer to the [official documentation](https://nixos.org/learn/).

## What yt-dlp-webui is not
`yt-dlp-webui` isn&#039;t your ordinary website where to download stuff from the internet, so don&#039;t try asking for links of where this is hosted. It&#039;s a self hosted platform for a Linux NAS.

## Troubleshooting
-   **It says that it isn&#039;t connected.**
    - In some circumstances, you must set the server ip address or hostname in the settings section (gear icon).
-   **The download  doesn&#039;t start.**
    - Simply, yt-dlp process takes a lot of time to fire up. (yt-dlp isn&#039;t fast especially if you have a lower-end/low-power NAS/server/desktop. Furthermore some yt-dlp builds are slower than others)

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cloudflare Tunnel client

Contains the command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel, a tunneling daemon that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins.
This daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a webserver). Cloudflare attracts client requests and sends them to you
via this daemon, without requiring you to poke holes on your firewall --- your origin can remain as closed as possible.
Extensive documentation can be found in the [Cloudflare Tunnel section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps) of the Cloudflare Docs.
All usages related with proxying to your origins are available under `cloudflared tunnel help`.

You can also use `cloudflared` to access Tunnel origins (that are protected with `cloudflared tunnel`) for TCP traffic
at Layer 4 (i.e., not HTTP/websocket), which is relevant for use cases such as SSH, RDP, etc.
Such usages are available under `cloudflared access help`.

You can instead use [WARP client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/private-networks)
to access private origins behind Tunnels for Layer 4 traffic without requiring `cloudflared access` commands on the client side.


## Before you get started

Before you use Cloudflare Tunnel, you&#039;ll need to complete a few steps in the Cloudflare dashboard: you need to add a
website to your Cloudflare account. Note that today it is possible to use Tunnel without a website (e.g. for private
routing), but for legacy reasons this requirement is still necessary:
1. [Add a website to Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Creating-a-Cloudflare-account-and-adding-a-website)
2. [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205195708)


## Installing `cloudflared`

Downloads are available as standalone binaries, a Docker image, and Debian, RPM, and Homebrew packages. You can also find releases [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) on the `cloudflared` GitHub repository.

* You can [install on macOS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation#macos) via Homebrew or by downloading the [latest Darwin amd64 release](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases)
* Binaries, Debian, and RPM packages for Linux [can be found here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation#linux)
* A Docker image of `cloudflared` is [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared)
* You can install on Windows machines with the [steps here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation#windows)
* To build from source, first you need to download the go toolchain by running `./.teamcity/install-cloudflare-go.sh` and follow the output. Then you can run `make cloudflared`

User documentation for Cloudflare Tunnel can be found at https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps


## Creating Tunnels and routing traffic

Once installed, you can authenticate `cloudflared` into your Cloudflare account and begin creating Tunnels to serve traffic to your origins.

* Create a Tunnel with [these instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/create-tunnel)
* Route traffic to that Tunnel:
  * Via public [DNS records in Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/dns)
  * Or via a public hostname guided by a [Cloudflare Load Balancer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb)
  * Or from [WARP client private traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/)


## TryCloudflare

Want to test Cloudflare Tunnel before adding a website to Cloudflare? You can do so with TryCloudflare using the documentation [available here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/).

## Deprecated versions

Cloudflare currently supports versions of cloudflared that are **within one year** of the most recent release. Breaking changes unrelated to feature availability may be introduced that will impact versions released more than one year ago. You can read more about upgrading cloudflared in our [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/#updating-cloudflared).

For example, as of January 2023 Cloudflare will support cloudflared version 2023.1.1 to cloudflared 2022.1.1.

## Development

### Requirements
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [capnp](https://capnproto.org/install.html)
- [cloudflare go toolchain](https://github.com/cloudflare/go)
- Optional tools:
  - [capnpc-go](https://pkg.go.dev/zombiezen.com/go/capnproto2/capnpc-go)
  - [goimports](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
  - [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
  - [gomocks](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/mock)

### Build
To build cloudflared locally run `make cloudflared`

### Test
To locally run the tests run `make test`

### Linting
To format the code and keep a good code quality use `make fmt` and `make lint`

### Mocks
After changes on interfaces you might need to regenerate the mocks, so run `make mock`

# Infrastructure as Code in any Programming Language

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pulumi.com/images/get-started.svg?&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

**Pulumi Infrastructure as Code** is the easiest way to build and deploy infrastructure, of any architecture and on any cloud, using programming languages that you already know and love. Code and ship infrastructure faster with your favorite languages and tools, and embed IaC anywhere with [Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/using-pulumi/automation-api/).

Simply write code in your favorite language and Pulumi automatically provisions and manages your resources on
[AWS](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/aws/),
[Azure](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/azure/),
[Google Cloud Platform](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/gcp/), 
[Kubernetes](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/kubernetes/), and [120+ providers](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/) using an
[infrastructure-as-code](https://www.pulumi.com/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) approach.
Skip the YAML, and use standard language features like loops, functions, classes,
and package management that you already know and love.

For example, create three web servers:

```typescript
const aws = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;);
const sg = new aws.ec2.SecurityGroup(&quot;web-sg&quot;, {
    ingress: [{ protocol: &quot;tcp&quot;, fromPort: 80, toPort: 80, cidrBlocks: [&quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot;] }],
});
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    new aws.ec2.Instance(`web-${i}`, {
        ami: &quot;ami-7172b611&quot;,
        instanceType: &quot;t2.micro&quot;,
        vpcSecurityGroupIds: [sg.id],
        userData: `#!/bin/bash
            echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot; &gt; index.html
            nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &amp;`,
    });
}
```

Or a simple serverless timer that archives Hacker News every day at 8:30AM:

```typescript
const aws = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;);

const snapshots = new aws.dynamodb.Table(&quot;snapshots&quot;, {
    attributes: [{ name: &quot;id&quot;, type: &quot;S&quot;, }],
    hashKey: &quot;id&quot;, billingMode: &quot;PAY_PER_REQUEST&quot;,
});

aws.cloudwatch.onSchedule(&quot;daily-yc-snapshot&quot;, &quot;cron(30 8 * * ? *)&quot;, () =&gt; {
    require(&quot;https&quot;).get(&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;, res =&gt; {
        let content = &quot;&quot;;
        res.setEncoding(&quot;utf8&quot;);
        res.on(&quot;data&quot;, chunk =&gt; content += chunk);
        res.on(&quot;end&quot;, () =&gt; new aws.sdk.DynamoDB.DocumentClient().put({
            TableName: snapshots.name.get(),
            Item: { date: Date.now(), content },
        }).promise());
    }).end();
});
```

Many examples are available spanning containers, serverless, and infrastructure in
[pulumi/examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples).

Pulumi is open source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/LICENSE), supports many languages and clouds, and is easy to extend.  This
repo contains the `pulumi` CLI, language SDKs, and core Pulumi engine, and individual libraries are in their own repos.

## &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Getting Started

[![Watch the video](/youtube_preview_image.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f8KF6UGN7g)

See the [Get Started](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/) guide to quickly get started with
Pulumi on your platform and cloud of choice.

Otherwise, the following steps demonstrate how to deploy your first Pulumi program, using AWS
Serverless Lambdas, in minutes:

1. **Install**:

    To install the latest Pulumi release, run the following (see full
    [installation instructions](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/) for additional installation options):

    ```bash
    $ curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com/ | sh
    ```

2. **Create a Project**:

    After installing, you can get started with the `pulumi new` command:

    ```bash
    $ mkdir pulumi-demo &amp;&amp; cd pulumi-demo
    $ pulumi new hello-aws-javascript
    ```

    The `new` command offers templates for all languages and clouds.  Run it without an argument and it&#039;ll prompt
    you with available projects.  This command created an AWS Serverless Lambda project written in JavaScript.

3. **Deploy to the Cloud**:

    Run `pulumi up` to get your code to the cloud:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    ```

    This makes all cloud resources needed to run your code.  Simply make edits to your project, and subsequent
    `pulumi up`s will compute the minimal diff to deploy your changes.

4. **Use Your Program**:

    Now that your code is deployed, you can interact with it.  In the above example, we can curl the endpoint:

    ```bash
    $ curl $(pulumi stack output url)
    ```

5. **Access the Logs**:

    If you&#039;re using containers or functions, Pulumi&#039;s unified logging command will show all of your logs:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi logs -f
    ```

6. **Destroy your Resources**:

    After you&#039;re done, you can remove all resources created by your program:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi destroy -y
    ```

To learn more, head over to [pulumi.com](https://pulumi.com/) for much more information, including
[tutorials](https://www.pulumi.com/tutorials/), [examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples), and
details of the core Pulumi CLI and [programming model concepts](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/).

## Install

```shell
go get github.com/spf13/viper
```

**Note:** Viper uses [Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies.


## What is Viper?

Viper is a complete configuration solution for Go applications including [12-Factor apps](https://12factor.net/#the_twelve_factors).
It is designed to work within an application, and can handle all types of configuration needs
and formats. It supports:

* setting defaults
* reading from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile and Java properties config files
* live watching and re-reading of config files (optional)
* reading from environment variables
* reading from remote config systems (etcd or Consul), and watching changes
* reading from command line flags
* reading from buffer
* setting explicit values

Viper can be thought of as a registry for all of your applications configuration needs.


## Why Viper?

When building a modern application, you don’t want to worry about
configuration file formats; you want to focus on building awesome software.
Viper is here to help with that.

Viper does the following for you:

1. Find, load, and unmarshal a configuration file in JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile or Java properties formats.
2. Provide a mechanism to set default values for your different configuration options.
3. Provide a mechanism to set override values for options specified through command line flags.
4. Provide an alias system to easily rename parameters without breaking existing code.
5. Make it easy to tell the difference between when a user has provided a command line or config file which is the same as the default.

Viper uses the following precedence order. Each item takes precedence over the item below it:

 * explicit call to `Set`
 * flag
 * env
 * config
 * key/value store
 * default

**Important:** Viper configuration keys are case insensitive.
There are ongoing discussions about making that optional.


## Putting Values into Viper

### Establishing Defaults

A good configuration system will support default values. A default value is not
required for a key, but it’s useful in the event that a key hasn&#039;t been set via
config file, environment variable, remote configuration or flag.

Examples:

```go
viper.SetDefault(&quot;ContentDir&quot;, &quot;content&quot;)
viper.SetDefault(&quot;LayoutDir&quot;, &quot;layouts&quot;)
viper.SetDefault(&quot;Taxonomies&quot;, map[string]string{&quot;tag&quot;: &quot;tags&quot;, &quot;category&quot;: &quot;categories&quot;})
```

### Reading Config Files

Viper requires minimal configuration so it knows where to look for config files.
Viper supports JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile and Java Properties files. Viper can search multiple paths, but
currently a single Viper instance only supports a single configuration file.
Viper does not default to any configuration search paths leaving defaults decision
to an application.

Here is an example of how to use Viper to search for and read a configuration file.
None of the specific paths are required, but at least one path should be provided
where a configuration file is expected.

```go
viper.SetConfigName(&quot;config&quot;) // name of config file (without extension)
viper.SetConfigType(&quot;yaml&quot;) // REQUIRED if the config file does not have the extension in the name
viper.AddConfigPath(&quot;/etc/appname/&quot;)   // path to look for the config file in
viper.AddConfigPath(&quot;$HOME/.appname&quot;)  // call multiple times to add many search paths
viper.AddConfigPath(&quot;.&quot;)               // optionally look for config in the working directory
err := viper.ReadInConfig() // Find and read the config file
if err != nil { // Handle errors reading the config file
	panic(fmt.Errorf(&quot;fatal error config file: %w&quot;, err))
}
```

You can handle the specific case where no config file is found like this:

```go
if err := viper.ReadInConfig(); err != nil {
	if _, ok := err.(viper.ConfigFileNotFoundError); ok {
		// Config file not found; ignore error if desired
	} else {
		// Config file was found but another error was produced
	}
}

// Config file found and successfully parsed
```

*NOTE [since 1.6]:* You can also have a file without an extension and specify the format programmatically. For those configuration files that lie in the home of the user without any extension like `.bashrc`

### Writing Config Files

Reading from config files is useful, but at times you want to store all modifications made at run time.
For that, a bunch of commands are available, each with its own purpose:

* WriteConfig - writes the current viper configuration to the predefined path, if exists. Errors if no predefined path. Will overwrite the current config file, if it exists.
* SafeWriteConfig - writes the current viper configuration to the predefined path. Errors if no predefined path. Will not overwrite the current config file, if it exists.
* WriteConfigAs - writes the current viper configuration to the given filepath. Will overwrite the given file, if it exists.
* SafeWriteConfigAs - writes the current viper configuration to the given filepath. Will not overwrite the given file, if it exists.

As a rule of the thumb, everything marked with safe won&#039;t overwrite any file, but just create if not existent, whilst the default behavior is to create or truncate.

A small examples section:

```go
viper.WriteConfig() // writes current config to predefined path set by &#039;viper.AddConfigPath()&#039; and &#039;viper.SetConfigName&#039;
viper.SafeWriteConfig()
viper.WriteConfigAs(&quot;/path/to/my/.config&quot;)
viper.SafeWriteConfigAs(&quot;/path/to/my/.config&quot;) // will error since it has already been written
viper.SafeWriteConfigAs(&quot;/path/to/my/.other_config&quot;)
```

### Watching and re-reading config files

Viper supports the ability to have your application live read a config file while running.

Gone are the days of needing to restart a server to have a config take effect,
viper powered applications can read an update to a config file while running and
not miss a beat.

Simply tell the viper instance to watchConfig.
Optionally you can provide a function for Viper to run each time a change occurs.

**Make sure you add all of the configPaths prior to calling `WatchConfig()`**

```go
viper.OnConfigChange(func(e fsnotify.Event) {
	fmt.Println(&quot;Config file changed:&quot;, e.Name)
})
viper.WatchConfig()
```

### Reading Config from io.Reader

Viper predefines many configuration sources such as files, environment
variables, flags, and remote K/V store, but you are not bound to them. You can
also implement your own required configuration source and feed it to viper.

```go
viper.SetConfigType(&quot;yaml&quot;) // or viper.SetConfigType(&quot;YAML&quot;)

// any approach to require this configuration into your program.
var yamlExample = []byte(`
Hacker: true
name: steve
hobbies:
- skateboarding
- snowboarding
- go
clothing:
  jacket: leather
  trousers: denim
age: 35
eyes : brown
beard: true
`)

viper.ReadConfig(bytes.NewBuffer(yamlExample))

viper.Get(&quot;name&quot;) // this would be &quot;steve&quot;
```

### Setting Overrides

These could be from a command line flag, or from your own application logic.

```go
viper.Set(&quot;Verbose&quot;, true)
viper.Set(&quot;LogFile&quot;, LogFile)
viper.Set(&quot;host.port&quot;, 5899)   // set subset
```

### Registering and Using Aliases

Aliases permit a single value to be referenced by multiple keys

```go
viper.RegisterAlias(&quot;loud&quot;, &quot;Verbose&quot;)

viper.Set(&quot;verbose&quot;, true) // same result as next line
viper.Set(&quot;loud&quot;, true)   // same result as prior line

viper.GetBool(&quot;loud&quot;) // true
viper.GetBool(&quot;verbose&quot;) // true
```

### Working with Environment Variables

Viper has full support for environment variables. This enables 12 factor
applications out of the box. There are five methods that exist to aid working
with ENV:

 * `AutomaticEnv()`
 * `BindEnv(string...) : error`
 * `SetEnvPrefix(string)`
 * `SetEnvKeyReplacer(string...) *strings.Replacer`
 * `AllowEmptyEnv(bool)`

_When working with ENV variables, it’s important to recognize that Viper
treats ENV variables as case sensitive._

Viper provides a mechanism to try to ensure that ENV variables are unique. By
using `SetEnvPrefix`, you can tell Viper to use a prefix while reading from
the environment variables. Both `BindEnv` and `AutomaticEnv` will use this
prefix.

`BindEnv` takes one or more parameters. The first parameter is the key name, the
rest are the name of the environment variables to bind to this key. If more than
one are provided, they will take precedence in the specified order. The name of
the environment variable is case sensitive. If the ENV variable name is not provided, then
Viper will automatically assume that the ENV variable matches the following format: prefix + &quot;_&quot; + the key name in ALL CAPS. When you explicitly provide the ENV variable name (the second parameter),
it **does not** automatically add the prefix. For example if the second parameter is &quot;id&quot;,
Viper will look for the ENV variable &quot;ID&quot;.

One important thing to recognize when working with ENV variables is that the
value will be read each time it is accessed. Viper does not fix the value when
the `BindEnv` is called.

`AutomaticEnv` is a powerful helper especially when combined with
`SetEnvPrefix`. When called, Viper will check for an environment variable any
time a `viper.Get` request is made. It will apply the following rules. It will
check for an environment variable with a name matching the key uppercased and
prefixed with the `EnvPrefix` if set.

`SetEnvKeyReplacer` allows you to use a `strings.Replacer` object to rewrite Env
keys to an extent. This is useful if you want to use `-` or something in your
`Get()` calls, but want your environmental variables to use `_` delimiters. An
example of using it can be found in `viper_test.go`.

Alternatively, you can use `EnvKeyReplacer` with `NewWithOptions` factory function.
Unlike `SetEnvKeyReplacer`, it accepts a `StringReplacer` interface allowing you to write custom string replacing logic.

By default empty environment variables are considered unset and will fall back to
the next configuration source. To treat empty environment variables as set, use
the `AllowEmptyEnv` method.

#### Env example

```go
SetEnvPrefix(&quot;spf&quot;) // will be uppercased automatically
BindEnv(&quot;id&quot;)

os.Setenv(&quot;SPF_ID&quot;, &quot;13&quot;) // typically done outside of the app

id := Get(&quot;id&quot;) // 13
```

### Working with Flags

Viper has the ability to bind to flags. Specifically, Viper supports `Pflags`
as used in the [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) library.

Like `BindEnv`, the value is not set when the binding method is called, but when
it is accessed. This means you can bind as early as you want, even in an
`init()` function.

For individual flags, the `BindPFlag()` method provides this functionality.

Example:

```go
serverCmd.Flags().Int(&quot;port&quot;, 1138, &quot;Port to run Application server on&quot;)
viper.BindPFlag(&quot;port&quot;, serverCmd.Flags().Lookup(&quot;port&quot;))
```

You can also bind an existing set of pflags (pflag.FlagSet):

Example:

```go
pflag.Int(&quot;flagname&quot;, 1234, &quot;help message for flagname&quot;)

pflag.Parse()
viper.BindPFlags(pflag.CommandLine)

i := viper.GetInt(&quot;flagname&quot;) // retrieve values from viper instead of pflag
```

The use of [pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag/) in Viper does not preclude
the use of other packages that use the [flag](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/)
package from the standard library. The pflag package can handle the flags
defined for the flag package by importing these flags. This is accomplished
by a calling a convenience function provided by the pflag package called
AddGoFlagSet().

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;flag&quot;
	&quot;github.com/spf13/pflag&quot;
)

func main() {

	// using standard library &quot;flag&quot; package
	flag.Int(&quot;flagname&quot;, 1234, &quot;help message for flagname&quot;)

	pflag.CommandLine.AddGoFlagSet(flag.CommandLine)
	pflag.Parse()
	viper.BindPFlags(pflag.CommandLine)

	i := viper.GetInt(&quot;flagname&quot;) // retrieve value from viper

	// ...
}
```

#### Flag interfaces

Viper provides two Go interfaces to bind other flag systems if you don’t use `Pflags`.

`FlagValue` represents a single flag. This is a very simple example on how to implement this interface:

```go
type myFlag struct {}
func (f myFlag) HasChanged() bool { return false }
func (f myFlag) Name() string { return &quot;my-flag-name&quot; }
func (f myFlag) ValueString() string { return &quot;my-flag-value&quot; }
func (f myFlag) ValueType() string { return &quot;string&quot; }
```

Once your flag implements this interface, you can simply tell Viper to bind it:

```go
viper.BindFlagValue(&quot;my-flag-name&quot;, myFlag{})
```

`FlagValueSet` represents a group of flags. This is a very simple example on how to implement this interface:

```go
type myFlagSet struct {
	flags []myFlag
}

func (f myFlagSet) VisitAll(fn func(FlagValue)) {
	for _, flag := range flags {
		fn(flag)
	}
}
```

Once your flag set implements this interface, you can simply tell Viper to bind it:

```go
fSet := myFlagSet{
	flags: []myFlag{myFlag{}, myFlag{}},
}
viper.BindFlagValues(&quot;my-flags&quot;, fSet)
```

### Remote Key/Value Store Support

To enable remote support in Viper, do a blank import of the `viper/remote`
package:

`import _ &quot;github.com/spf13/viper/remote&quot;`

Viper will read a config string (as JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL or envfile) retrieved from a path
in a Key/Value store such as etcd or Consul.  These values take precedence over
default values, but are overridden by configuration values retrieved from disk,
flags, or environment variables.

Viper supports multiple hosts. To use, pass a list of endpoints separated by `;`. For example `http://127.0.0.1:4001;http://127.0.0.1:4002`.

Viper uses [crypt](https://github.com/sagikazarmark/crypt) to retrieve
configuration from the K/V store, which means that you can store your
configuration values encrypted and have them automatically decrypted if you have
the correct gpg keyring.  Encryption is optional.

You can use remote configuration in conjunction with local configuration, or
independently of it.

`crypt` has a command-line helper that you can use to put configurations in your
K/V store. `crypt` defaults to etcd on http://127.0.0.1:4001.

```bash
$ go get github.com/sagikazarmark/crypt/bin/crypt
$ crypt set -plaintext /config/hugo.json /Users/hugo/settings/config.json
```

Confirm that your value was set:

```bash
$ crypt get -plaintext /config/hugo.json
```

See the `crypt` documentation for examples of how to set encrypted values, or
how to use Consul.

### Remote Key/Value Store Example - Unencrypted

#### etcd
```go
viper.AddRemoteProvider(&quot;etcd&quot;, &quot;http://127.0.0.1:4001&quot;,&quot;/config/hugo.json&quot;)
viper.SetConfigType(&quot;json&quot;) // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are &quot;json&quot;, &quot;toml&quot;, &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;yml&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;, &quot;props&quot;, &quot;prop&quot;, &quot;env&quot;, &quot;dotenv&quot;
err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig()
```

#### etcd3
```go
viper.AddRemoteProvider(&quot;etcd3&quot;, &quot;http://127.0.0.1:4001&quot;,&quot;/config/hugo.json&quot;)
viper.SetConfigType(&quot;json&quot;) // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are &quot;json&quot;, &quot;toml&quot;, &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;yml&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;, &quot;props&quot;, &quot;prop&quot;, &quot;env&quot;, &quot;dotenv&quot;
err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig()
```

#### Consul
You need to set a key to Consul key/value storage with JSON value containing your desired config.
For example, create a Consul key/value store key `MY_CONSUL_KEY` with value:

```json
{
    &quot;port&quot;: 8080,
    &quot;hostname&quot;: &quot;myhostname.com&quot;
}
```

```go
viper.AddRemoteProvider(&quot;consul&quot;, &quot;localhost:8500&quot;, &quot;MY_CONSUL_KEY&quot;)
viper.SetConfigType(&quot;json&quot;) // Need to explicitly set this to json
err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig()

fmt.Println(viper.Get(&quot;port&quot;)) // 8080
fmt.Println(viper.Get(&quot;hostname&quot;)) // myhostname.com
```

#### Firestore

```go
viper.AddRemoteProvider(&quot;firestore&quot;, &quot;google-cloud-project-id&quot;, &quot;collection/document&quot;)
viper.SetConfigType(&quot;json&quot;) // Config&#039;s format: &quot;json&quot;, &quot;toml&quot;, &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;yml&quot;
err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig()
```

Of course, you&#039;re allowed to use `SecureRemoteProvider` also


#### NATS

```go
viper.AddRemoteProvider(&quot;nats&quot;, &quot;nats://127.0.0.1:4222&quot;, &quot;myapp.config&quot;)
viper.SetConfigType(&quot;json&quot;)
err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig()
```

### Remote Key/Value Store Example - Encrypted

```go
viper.AddSecureRemoteProvider(&quot;etcd&quot;,&quot;http://127.0.0.1:4001&quot;,&quot;/config/hugo.json&quot;,&quot;/etc/secrets/mykeyring.gpg&quot;)
viper.SetConfigType(&quot;json&quot;) // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes,  supported extensions are &quot;json&quot;, &quot;toml&quot;, &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;yml&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;, &quot;props&quot;, &quot;prop&quot;, &quot;env&quot;, &quot;dotenv&quot;
err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig()
```

### Watching Changes in etcd - Unencrypted

```go
// alternatively, you can create a new viper instance.
var runtime_viper = viper.New()

runtime_viper.AddRemoteProvider(&quot;etcd&quot;, &quot;http://127.0.0.1:4001&quot;, &quot;/config/hugo.yml&quot;)
runtime_viper.SetConfigType(&quot;yaml&quot;) // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are &quot;json&quot;, &quot;toml&quot;, &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;yml&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;, &quot;props&quot;, &quot;prop&quot;, &quot;env&quot;, &quot;dotenv&quot;

// read from remote config the first time.
err := runtime_viper.ReadRemoteConfig()

// unmarshal config
runtime_viper.Unmarshal(&amp;runtime_conf)

// open a goroutine to watch remote changes forever
go func(){
	for {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 5) // delay after each request

		// currently, only tested with etcd support
		err := runtime_viper.WatchRemoteConfig()
		if err != nil {
			log.Errorf(&quot;unable to read remote config: %v&quot;, err)
			continue
		}

		// unmarshal new config into our runtime config struct. you can also use channel
		// to implement a signal to notify the system of the changes
		runtime_viper.Unmarshal(&amp;runtime_conf)
	}
}()
```

## Getting Values From Viper

In Viper, there are a few ways to get a value depending on the value’s type.
The following functions and methods exist:

 * `Get(key string) : any`
 * `GetBool(key string) : bool`
 * `GetFloat64(key string) : float64`
 * `GetInt(key string) : int`
 * `GetIntSlice(key string) : []int`
 * `GetString(key string) : string`
 * `GetStringMap(key string) : map[string]any`
 * `GetStringMapString(key string) : map[string]string`
 * `GetStringSlice(key string) : []string`
 * `GetTime(key string) : time.Time`
 * `GetDuration(key string) : time.Duration`
 * `IsSet(ke

## Testimonials

&gt; This is by far my favorite web framework for Go. It is inspired by FastAPI, which is also amazing, and conforms to many RFCs for common web things ... I really like the feature set, the fact that it [can use] Chi, and the fact that it is still somehow relatively simple to use. I&#039;ve tried other frameworks and they do not spark joy for me. - [Jeb_Jenky](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/zhitcg/comment/izmg6vk/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&gt; After working with #Golang for over a year, I stumbled upon Huma, the #FastAPI-inspired web framework. It’s the Christmas miracle I’ve been hoping for! This framework has everything! - [Hana Mohan](https://twitter.com/unamashana/status/1733088066053583197)

&gt; I love Huma. Thank you, sincerely, for this awesome package. I’ve been using it for some time now and it’s been great! - [plscott](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1aoshey/comment/kq6hcpd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&gt; Thank you Daniel for Huma. Superbly useful project and saves us a lot of time and hassle thanks to the OpenAPI gen — similar to FastAPI in Python. - [WolvesOfAllStreets](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1aqj99d/comment/kqfqcml/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&gt; Huma is wonderful, I&#039;ve started working with it recently, and it&#039;s a pleasure, so thank you very much for your efforts 🙏 - [callmemicah](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1b32ts4/comment/ksvr9h7/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&gt; It took us 3 months to build our platform in Python with FastAPI, SQL Alchemy and only 3 weeks to rewrite it in Go with Huma and SQL C. Things just work and I seldomly have to debug where in Python I spent a majority of my time debugging. - [Bitclick\_](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1cj2znb/comment/l2e4u6y/)

&gt; Look at Huma, it&#039;s great. A nice slim layer on top of stdlib mux/chi and automatic body and parameter serialization, kinda feels like doing dotnet web APIs, but forces you to actually design request and response structs, which is great imo. - [Kirides](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1fnn5c2/comment/lokuvpo/)

# Install

Install via `go get`. Note that Go 1.21 or newer is required.

```sh
# After: go mod init ...
go get -u github.com/danielgtaylor/huma/v2
```

# Example

Here is a complete basic hello world example in Huma, that shows how to initialize a Huma app complete with CLI, declare a resource operation, and define its handler function.

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;net/http&quot;

	&quot;github.com/danielgtaylor/huma/v2&quot;
	&quot;github.com/danielgtaylor/huma/v2/adapters/humachi&quot;
	&quot;github.com/danielgtaylor/huma/v2/humacli&quot;
	&quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5&quot;

	_ &quot;github.com/danielgtaylor/huma/v2/formats/cbor&quot;
)

// Options for the CLI. Pass `--port` or set the `SERVICE_PORT` env var.
type Options struct {
	Port int `help:&quot;Port to listen on&quot; short:&quot;p&quot; default:&quot;8888&quot;`
}

// GreetingOutput represents the greeting operation response.
type GreetingOutput struct {
	Body struct {
		Message string `json:&quot;message&quot; example:&quot;Hello, world!&quot; doc:&quot;Greeting message&quot;`
	}
}

func main() {
	// Create a CLI app which takes a port option.
	cli := humacli.New(func(hooks humacli.Hooks, options *Options) {
		// Create a new router &amp; API
		router := chi.NewMux()
		api := humachi.New(router, huma.DefaultConfig(&quot;My API&quot;, &quot;1.0.0&quot;))

		// Add the operation handler to the API.
		huma.Get(api, &quot;/greeting/{name}&quot;, func(ctx context.Context, input *struct{
			Name string `path:&quot;name&quot; maxLength:&quot;30&quot; example:&quot;world&quot; doc:&quot;Name to greet&quot;`
		}) (*GreetingOutput, error) {
			resp := &amp;GreetingOutput{}
			resp.Body.Message = fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Hello, %s!&quot;, input.Name)
			return resp, nil
		})

		// Tell the CLI how to start your router.
		hooks.OnStart(func() {
			http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;:%d&quot;, options.Port), router)
		})
	})

	// Run the CLI. When passed no commands, it starts the server.
	cli.Run()
}
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Replace `chi.NewMux()` → `http.NewServeMux()` and `humachi.New` → `humago.New` to use the standard library router from Go 1.22+. Just make sure your `go.mod` has `go 1.22` or newer listed in it. Everything else stays the same! Switch whenever you are ready.

You can test it with `go run greet.go` (optionally pass `--port` to change the default) and make a sample request using [Restish](https://rest.sh/) (or `curl`):

```sh
# Get the message from the server
$ restish :8888/greeting/world
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
{
	$schema: &quot;http://localhost:8888/schemas/GreetingOutputBody.json&quot;,
	message: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
}
```

Even though the example is tiny you can also see some generated documentation at http://localhost:8888/docs. The generated OpenAPI is available at http://localhost:8888/openapi.json or http://localhost:8888/openapi.yaml.

Check out the [Huma tutorial](https://huma.rocks/tutorial/installation/) for a step-by-step guide to get started.

OpenTofu is an OSS tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. OpenTofu can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of OpenTofu are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: OpenTofu has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what OpenTofu will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when OpenTofu manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: OpenTofu builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, OpenTofu builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what OpenTofu will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

&lt;/p&gt;

## What is it?

Glow is a terminal based markdown reader designed from the ground up to bring
out the beauty—and power—of the CLI.

Use it to discover markdown files, read documentation directly on the command
line. Glow will find local markdown files in subdirectories or a local
Git repository.

## Installation

### Package Manager

```bash
# macOS or Linux
brew install glow

# macOS (with MacPorts)
sudo port install glow

# Arch Linux (btw)
pacman -S glow

# Void Linux
xbps-install -S glow

# Nix shell
nix-shell -p glow --command glow

# FreeBSD
pkg install glow

# Solus
eopkg install glow

# Windows (with Chocolatey, Scoop, or Winget)
choco install glow
scoop install glow
winget install charmbracelet.glow

# Android (with termux)
pkg install glow

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install glow

# Fedora/RHEL
echo &#039;[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key&#039; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install glow
```

Or download a binary from the [releases][releases] page. MacOS, Linux, Windows,
FreeBSD and OpenBSD binaries are available, as well as Debian, RPM, and Alpine
packages. ARM builds are also available for macOS, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

### Go

Or just install it with `go`:

```bash
go install github.com/charmbracelet/glow@latest
```

### Build (requires Go 1.21+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow.git
cd glow
go build
```

[releases]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow/releases

## The TUI

Simply run `glow` without arguments to start the textual user interface and
browse local. Glow will find local markdown files in the
current directory and below or, if you’re in a Git repository, Glow will search
the repo.

Markdown files can be read with Glow&#039;s high-performance pager. Most of the
keystrokes you know from `less` are the same, but you can press `?` to list
the hotkeys.

## The CLI

In addition to a TUI, Glow has a CLI for working with Markdown. To format a
document use a markdown source as the primary argument:

```bash
# Read from file
glow README.md

# Read from stdin
echo &quot;[Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)&quot; | glow -

# Fetch README from GitHub / GitLab
glow github.com/charmbracelet/glow

# Fetch markdown from HTTP
glow https://host.tld/file.md
```

### Word Wrapping

The `-w` flag lets you set a maximum width at which the output will be wrapped:

```bash
glow -w 60
```

### Paging

CLI output can be displayed in your preferred pager with the `-p` flag. This defaults
to the ANSI-aware `less -r` if `$PAGER` is not explicitly set.

### Styles

You can choose a style with the `-s` flag. When no flag is provided `glow` tries
to detect your terminal&#039;s current background color and automatically picks
either the `dark` or the `light` style for you.

```bash
glow -s [dark|light]
```

Alternatively you can also supply a custom JSON stylesheet:

```bash
glow -s mystyle.json
```

For additional usage details see:

```bash
glow --help
```

Check out the [Glamour Style Section](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour/blob/master/styles/gallery/README.md)
to find more styles. Or [make your own](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour/tree/master/styles)!

## The Config File

If you find yourself supplying the same flags to `glow` all the time, it&#039;s
probably a good idea to create a config file. Run `glow config`, which will open
it in your favorite $EDITOR. Alternatively you can manually put a file named
`glow.yml` in the default config path of you platform. If you&#039;re not sure where
that is, please refer to `glow --help`.

Here&#039;s an example config:

```yaml
# style name or JSON path (default &quot;auto&quot;)
style: &quot;light&quot;
# mouse wheel support (TUI-mode only)
mouse: true
# use pager to display markdown
pager: true
# at which column should we word wrap?
width: 80
# show all files, including hidden and ignored.
all: false
```

**ntfy** (pronounced &quot;*notify*&quot;) is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) 
notification service. With ntfy, you can **send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts** from any computer, 
**without having to sign up or pay any fees**. If you&#039;d like to run your own instance of the service, you can easily do 
so since ntfy is open source.

You can access the free version of ntfy at **[ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh)**. There is also an [open-source Android app](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android)
available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/),
as well as an [open source iOS app](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-ios) available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347).

## [ntfy Pro](https://ntfy.sh/app) 💸 🎉
I now offer paid plans for [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) if you don&#039;t want to self-host, or you want to support the development of 
ntfy (→ [Purchase via web app](https://ntfy.sh/app)). You can **buy a plan for as low as $5/month**.
You can also donate via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier), and [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/ntfy).

There are a few ways to get in touch with me and/or the rest of the community. Feel free to use any of these methods. Whatever
works best for you:

* [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cT7ECsZj9w) - direct chat with the community

## Announcements/beta testers
For announcements of new releases and cutting-edge beta versions, please subscribe to the [ntfy.sh/announcements](https://ntfy.sh/announcements) 
topic. If you&#039;d like to test the iOS app, join [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/P1fFnAm9). For Android betas,
join Discord/Matrix (I&#039;ll eventually make a testing channel in Google Play).

## Contributing
I welcome any contributions. Just create a PR or an issue. For larger features/ideas, please reach out
on Discord/Matrix first to see if I&#039;d accept them. To contribute code, check out the [build instructions](https://ntfy.sh/docs/develop/) 
for the server and the Android app. Or, if you&#039;d like to help translate 🇩🇪 🇺🇸 🇧🇬, you can start immediately in

## Sponsors
I have just very recently started accepting donations via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier),
and [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/ntfy). I would be humbled if you helped me carry the server and developer 
account costs. Even small donations are very much appreciated. A big fat **Thank You** to the folks who have sponsored ntfy in the past, or are still sponsoring ntfy:

Jet is a complete solution for efficient and high performance database access, combining a type-safe SQL builder with code generation
and automatic query result mapping.

Jet currently supports the following database engines:

* `PostgreSQL`
* `MySQL`
* `SQLite`

This list is not exclusive, as many other databases implement compatible wire protocols. For example, `CockroachDB` uses the
`PostgreSQL` wire protocol, and `MariaDB` is based on the `MySQL` protocol. Both databases are tested and known to work with Jet.

Support for additional databases may be introduced in future releases.

![jet](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/image/jet.png)  
Jet is the easiest, and the fastest way to write complex type-safe SQL queries as a Go code and map database query result
into complex object composition.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Jet is __not__ an ORM.

## Features
1) Auto-generated type-safe SQL Builder. Statements supported:
    * [SELECT](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/SELECT), [SELECT_JSON](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/SELECT_JSON-Statements) `(DISTINCT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, FOR, LOCK_IN_SHARE_MODE, UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, WINDOW, sub-queries)`
    * [INSERT](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/INSERT) `(VALUES, MODEL, MODELS, QUERY, ON_CONFLICT/ON_DUPLICATE_KEY_UPDATE, RETURNING)`,
    * [UPDATE](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/UPDATE) `(SET, MODEL, WHERE, RETURNING)`,
    * [DELETE](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/DELETE) `(WHERE, ORDER_BY, LIMIT, RETURNING)`,
    * [LOCK](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/LOCK) `(IN, NOWAIT)`, `(READ, WRITE)`
    * [WITH](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/WITH)

2) Auto-generated Data Model types - Go types mapped to database type (table, view or enum), used to store
   result of database queries. Can be combined to create complex query result destination.
3) Query execution with result mapping to arbitrary destination.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To install Jet package, you need to install Go and set your Go workspace first.

[Go](https://golang.org/) **version 1.22+ is required**

### Installation

Use the command bellow to add jet as a dependency into `go.mod` project:
```sh
$ go get -u github.com/go-jet/jet/v2
```

Jet generator can be installed using one of the following methods:

- ✅ Option 1: Install via go install:
```sh
go install github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/cmd/jet@latest
```

&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; Jet generator is installed to the directory named by the `GOBIN` environment variable,
which defaults to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` if the `GOPATH` environment variable is not set.

- ✅ Option 2: Build manually from source and install jet generator to specific folder:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/go-jet/jet.git
cd jet &amp;&amp; go build -o &lt;target_directory&gt; ./cmd/jet
```
&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; Make sure `target_directory` is included in your system’s `PATH` environment variable to allow global access to the jet command.


### Quick Start
For this quick start example we will use PostgreSQL sample _&#039;dvd rental&#039;_ database. Full database dump can be found in
[./tests/testdata/init/postgres/dvds.sql](https://github.com/go-jet/jet-test-data/blob/master/init/postgres/dvds.sql).
A schema diagram illustrating the relevant part of the database is available [here](./examples/quick-start/diagram.png).

#### Generate SQL Builder and Model types
To generate jet SQL Builder and Data Model types from running postgres database, we need to call `jet` generator with postgres
connection parameters and destination folder path.
Assuming we are running local postgres database, with user `user`, user password `pass`, database `jetdb` and
schema `dvds` we will use this command:
```sh
jet -dsn=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/jetdb?sslmode=disable -schema=dvds -path=./.gen
```
```sh
Connecting to postgres database: postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/jetdb?sslmode=disable 
Retrieving schema information...
  FOUND 15 table(s), 7 view(s), 1 enum(s)
Cleaning up destination directory...
Generating table sql builder files...
Generating view sql builder files...
Generating enum sql builder files...
Generating table model files...
Generating view model files...
Generating enum model files...
Done
```
Procedure is similar for MySQL, CockroachDB, MariaDB and SQLite. For example:
```sh
jet -source=mysql -dsn=&quot;user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/dbname&quot; -path=./.gen
jet -dsn=postgres://user:pass@localhost:26257/jetdb?sslmode=disable -schema=dvds -path=./.gen  #cockroachdb
jet -dsn=&quot;mariadb://user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/dvds&quot; -path=./.gen              # source flag can be omitted if data source appears in dsn
jet -source=sqlite -dsn=&quot;/path/to/sqlite/database/file&quot; -schema=dvds -path=./.gen
jet -dsn=&quot;file:///path/to/sqlite/database/file&quot; -schema=dvds -path=./.gen         # sqlite database assumed for &#039;file&#039; data sources
```
_*User has to have a permission to read information schema tables._

As indicated by the command output, Jet will perform the following actions:
- ✅ Connect to the PostgreSQL database and retrieve metadata for all `tables`, `views`, and `enums` within the `dvds` schema.
- ⚠️ **Delete all contents** in the target schema folder: `./.gen/jetdb/dvds`.
- ⚙️ Generate **SQL Builder** and **Data Model** types for each table, view, and enum found in the schema.

Generated files folder structure will look like this:
```sh 
|-- .gen                              # path
|   -- jetdb                          # database name
|       -- dvds                       # schema name
|           |-- enum                  # sql builder package for enums
|           |   |-- mpaa_rating.go
|           |-- table                 # sql builder package for tables
|               |-- actor.go
|               |-- address.go
|               |-- category.go
|               ...
|           |-- view                  # sql builder package for views
|               |-- actor_info.go
|               |-- film_list.go
|               ...
|           |-- model                 # data model types for each table, view and enum
|           |   |-- actor.go
|           |   |-- address.go
|           |   |-- mpaa_rating.go
|           |   ...
```

Types from the `table`, `view`, and `enum` packages are used to write **type-safe SQL queries in Go**, while types from the `model` types are combined to store
results of the SQL queries.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; It is possible to customize the default Jet generator behavior. All the aspects of generated SQLBuilder and model types 
&gt; are customizable(see [wiki](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/Generator#generator-customization)).


#### Let&#039;s write some SQL queries in Go

First we need to import postgres SQLBuilder and generated packages from the previous step:
```go
import (
  // dot import so go code would resemble as much as native SQL
  // dot import is not mandatory
  . &quot;github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/examples/quick-start/.gen/jetdb/dvds/table&quot;
  . &quot;github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/postgres&quot;

  &quot;github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/examples/quick-start/.gen/jetdb/dvds/enum&quot;
  &quot;github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/examples/quick-start/.gen/jetdb/dvds/model&quot;  
)
```
Let&#039;s say we want to retrieve the list of all _actors_ who acted in _films_ longer than 180 minutes, _film language_ is &#039;English&#039;, 
_film category_ is not &#039;Action&#039; and _film rating_ is not &#039;R&#039;.
```golang
stmt := SELECT(
    Actor.ActorID, Actor.FirstName, Actor.LastName, Actor.LastUpdate,  // or just Actor.AllColumns
    Film.AllColumns,                                                  
    Language.AllColumns.Except(Language.LastUpdate),  // all language columns except last_update 
    Category.AllColumns,
).FROM(
    Actor.
        INNER_JOIN(FilmActor, Actor.ActorID.EQ(FilmActor.ActorID)).  
        INNER_JOIN(Film, Film.FilmID.EQ(FilmActor.FilmID)).          
        INNER_JOIN(Language, Language.LanguageID.EQ(Film.LanguageID)).
        INNER_JOIN(FilmCategory, FilmCategory.FilmID.EQ(Film.FilmID)).
        INNER_JOIN(Category, Category.CategoryID.EQ(FilmCategory.CategoryID)),
).WHERE(
    Language.Name.EQ(Char(20)(&quot;English&quot;)).             
        AND(Category.Name.NOT_EQ(Text(&quot;Action&quot;))).  
        AND(Film.Length.GT(Int32(180))).
        AND(Film.Rating.NOT_EQ(enum.MpaaRating.R)),              
).ORDER_BY(
    Actor.ActorID.ASC(),
    Film.FilmID.ASC(),
)
```
&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; Package(dot) import is used, so the statements look as close as possible to the native SQL.  

Note that every column has a type. String columns, such as `Language.Name` and `Category.Name` can only be compared with
string columns and expressions. Similarity, `Actor.ActorID`, `FilmActor.ActorID`, `Film.Length` are integer columns
and can only be compared with integer columns and expressions.

#### Execute Query and Store Result

Well-formed SQL is just a first half of the job. Let&#039;s see how can we make some sense of result set returned executing
above statement. Usually this is the most complex and tedious work, but with Jet it is the easiest.

First, we need to define the structure in which to store the query result. This
can be achieved by combining autogenerated model types, or by using custom
model types(see [wiki](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/Query-Result-Mapping-(QRM)#custom-model-types) for more information).

Let&#039;s say this is our desired structure made of autogenerated types:
```go
var dest []struct {
    model.Actor
    
    Films []struct {
        model.Film
        
        Language    model.Language
        Categories  []model.Category
    }
}
```

The `Films` field is a slice because an actor can appear in multiple films,
and each film is associated with a single language. The `Language` field,
on the other hand, is a single model struct. A `Film` can belong to multiple
categories.
 
&gt; [!Note]
&gt; There is no limitation of how big or nested destination can be.

Now, let&#039;s execute the above statement on an open database connection (or
transaction) `db` and store the result in the `dest` variable.

```go
err := stmt.Query(db, &amp;dest)
handleError(err)
```

__And that&#039;s it.__

The `dest` variable now contains a list of all actors (each with a list of
films they acted in). Each film includes information about its language and
a list of categories it belongs to. This list is filtered to include only
films longer than 180 minutes, where the film language is &#039;English&#039;, and
the film category is not &#039;Action&#039;.

&gt; [!Tip]  
&gt; It is recommended to enable **Strict Scan** on application startup, especially when destination contains 
&gt; custom model types. For more details, see the [wiki](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/Query-Result-Mapping-(QRM)#strict-scan).

Lets print `dest` as a JSON to see:
```go
jsonText, _ := json.MarshalIndent(dest, &quot;&quot;, &quot;\t&quot;)
fmt.Println(string(jsonText))
```

What if, we also want to have list of films per category and actors per category, where films are longer than 180 minutes, film language is &#039;English&#039;
and film category is not &#039;Action&#039;.  
In that case we can reuse above statement `stmt`, and just change our destination:

```go
var dest2 []struct {
    model.Category

    Films []model.Film
    Actors []model.Actor
}

err = stmt.Query(db, &amp;dest2)
handleError(err)
```
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Click to see `dest2` json&lt;/summary&gt;

## Why do you need Personal Cloud?

In 2020, the team noticed three important trends:
- The cost of computing power and storage was decreasing fast.
- A part of cloud computing was moving towards edge computing.
- The issue of consumer data asset ownership and attribution had been ignored.

Based on these trends, the team proposed a thought experiment internally: what if personal clouds were available under $100 in next five years? This personal cloud would provide a low-cost data collaboration solution as a personal data center, storing and managing data for creators and small organizations. A distributed collaborative computing network can be formed by personal servers located around the world. It could also control and connect all smart devices, providing cross-ecosystem local intelligent services.

Furthermore, the personal cloud could combine personal data to train personalized AI assistants. The idea is that this technology would be an effective way to solve the issue of consumer data asset ownership and , as well as provide a more affordable and efficient computing solution for individuals and small organizations.

The word Casa comes from the Spanish word for &quot;home&quot;. Project CasaOS originated as a pre-installed system for the crowdfunded product [ZimaBoard](https://www.zimaboard.com) on Kickstarter.

After looking at many systems and software on the market, the team found no server system designed for home scenarios, sadly true.

So, we set out to build this open-source project to develop CasaOS with our own hands, everyone in the community, and you.

We believe that through community-driven collaborative innovation and open communication with global developers, we can reshape the digital home experience like never before.

![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true &quot;Docker Compose Logo&quot;)

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.

# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app&#039;s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `compose.yaml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - &quot;5000:5000&quot;
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```

Contributing
------------

Want to help develop Docker Compose? Check out our
[contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you find an issue, please report it on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).

Legacy
-------------

The Python version of Compose is available under the `v1` [branch](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># GitHub CLI

`gh` is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code.

![screenshot of gh pr status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98482/84171218-327e7a80-aa40-11ea-8cd1-5177fc2d0e72.png)

GitHub CLI is supported for users on GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+ with support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Documentation

For [installation options see below](#installation), for usage instructions [see the manual][manual].

## Contributing

If anything feels off, or if you feel that some functionality is missing, please check out the [contributing page][contributing]. There you will find instructions for sharing your feedback, building the tool locally, and submitting pull requests to the project.

If you are a hubber and are interested in shipping new commands for the CLI, check out our [doc on internal contributions][intake-doc].

&lt;!-- this anchor is linked to from elsewhere, so avoid renaming it --&gt;

To add GitHub CLI to your codespace, add the following to your [devcontainer file](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-features-to-a-devcontainer-file):

```json
&quot;features&quot;: {
  &quot;ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1&quot;: {}
}
```

### GitHub Actions

GitHub CLI comes pre-installed in all [GitHub-Hosted Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

### Other platforms

Download packaged binaries from the [releases page][].

#### Verification of binaries

Since version 2.50.0 `gh` has been producing [Build Provenance Attestation](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-06-25-artifact-attestations-is-generally-available/) enabling a cryptographically verifiable paper-trail back to the origin GitHub repository, git revision and build instructions used. The build provenance attestations are signed and relies on Public Good [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) for PKI.

There are two common ways to verify a downloaded release, depending if `gh` is already installed or not. If `gh` is installed, it&#039;s trivial to verify a new release:

- **Option 1: Using `gh` if already installed:**

  ```shell
  $ gh at verify -R cli/cli gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded digest sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc for file://gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
  ✓ Verification succeeded!

  sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc was attested by:
  REPO     PREDICATE_TYPE                  WORKFLOW
  cli/cli  https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1  .github/workflows/deployment.yml@refs/heads/trunk
  ```

- **Option 2: Using Sigstore [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign):**

  To perform this, download the [attestation](https://github.com/cli/cli/attestations) for the downloaded release and use cosign to verify the authenticity of the downloaded release:

  ```shell
  $ cosign verify-blob-attestation --bundle cli-cli-attestation-3120304.sigstore.json \
        --new-bundle-format \
        --certificate-oidc-issuer=&quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot; \
        --certificate-identity-regexp=&quot;^https://github.com/cli/cli/.github/workflows/deployment.yml@refs/heads/trunk$&quot; \
        gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Verified OK
  ```

### Build from source

See here on how to [build GitHub CLI from source][build from source].

## Comparison with hub

For many years, [hub][] was the unofficial GitHub CLI tool. `gh` is a new project that helps us explore
what an official GitHub CLI tool can look like with a fundamentally different design. While both
tools bring GitHub to the terminal, `hub` behaves as a proxy to `git`, and `gh` is a standalone
tool. Check out our [more detailed explanation][gh-vs-hub] to learn more.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most
painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across **all** the platforms and
architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and
Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.
This project has been
[forked](https://blog.gitea.com/welcome-to-gitea/) from
[Gogs](https://gogs.io) since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit [demo.gitea.com](https://demo.gitea.com).

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit [gitea.com](https://gitea.com/user/login).

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at [cloud.gitea.com](https://cloud.gitea.com).

## Documentation

You can find comprehensive documentation on our official [documentation website](https://docs.gitea.com/).

It includes installation, administration, usage, development, contributing guides, and more to help you get started and explore all features effectively.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to it, you can visit the [documentation repository](https://gitea.com/gitea/docs)

## Building

From the root of the source tree, run:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata&quot; make build

or if SQLite support is required:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify&quot; make build

The `build` target is split into two sub-targets:

- `make backend` which requires [Go Stable](https://go.dev/dl/), the required version is defined in [go.mod](/go.mod).
- `make frontend` which requires [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater.

Internet connectivity is required to download the go and npm modules. When building from the official source tarballs which include pre-built frontend files, the `frontend` target will not be triggered, making it possible to build without Node.js.

More info: https://docs.gitea.com/installation/install-from-source

## Using

After building, a binary file named `gitea` will be generated in the root of the source tree by default. To run it, use:

    ./gitea web

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re interested in using our APIs, we have experimental support with [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/api).

## Contributing

Expected workflow is: Fork -&gt; Patch -&gt; Push -&gt; Pull Request

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; 1. **YOU MUST READ THE [CONTRIBUTORS GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md) BEFORE STARTING TO WORK ON A PULL REQUEST.**
&gt; 2. If you have found a vulnerability in the project, please write privately to **security@gitea.io**. Thanks!

## Translating

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/gitea/localized.svg)](https://translate.gitea.com)

Translations are done through [Crowdin](https://translate.gitea.com). If you want to translate to a new language ask one of the managers in the Crowdin project to add a new language there.

You can also just create an issue for adding a language or ask on discord on the #translation channel. If you need context or find some translation issues, you can leave a comment on the string or ask on Discord. For general translation questions there is a section in the docs. Currently a bit empty but we hope to fill it as questions pop up.

Get more information from [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/contributing/localization).

## Official and Third-Party Projects

We provide an official [go-sdk](https://gitea.com/gitea/go-sdk), a CLI tool called [tea](https://gitea.com/gitea/tea) and an [action runner](https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner) for Gitea Action.

We maintain a list of Gitea-related projects at [gitea/awesome-gitea](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea), where you can discover more third-party projects, including SDKs, plugins, themes, and more.

## Sponsorship

&lt;img src=&quot;docs/logo.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;

evcc believes in open source software. We&#039;re committed to provide best in class EV charging experience.
Maintaining evcc consumes time and effort. With the vast amount of different devices to support, we depend on community and vendor support to keep evcc alive.

While evcc is open source, we would also like to encourage vendors to provide open source hardware devices, public documentation and support open source projects like ours that provide additional value to otherwise closed hardware. Where this is not the case, evcc requires &quot;sponsor token&quot; to finance ongoing development and support of evcc.
