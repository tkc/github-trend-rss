# Wave Terminal

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm?ref=badge_shield)

Wave is an open-source terminal that combines traditional terminal features with graphical capabilities like file previews, web browsing, and AI assistance. It runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

Modern development involves constantly switching between terminals and browsers - checking documentation, previewing files, monitoring systems, and using AI tools. Wave brings these graphical tools directly into the terminal, letting you control them from the command line. This means you can stay in your terminal workflow while still having access to the visual interfaces you need.

The Cosmos SDK is a modular, open-source blockchain SDK for building secure, high-performance Layer 1 chains with full customizability used by 200+ chains in production.   Developers can use the Cosmos SDK to easily and quickly spin up custom blockchains that can natively interoperate.

The Cosmos SDK is tailored for building secure, sovereign application-specific blockchains. Developers building with the Cosmos SDK can use predefined modules that cover standard blockchain functionality or create custom modules for their specific use case. This composable architecture enables robust customization. The SDK provides abstractions for permissioning, governance, state management, account abstraction, tokenization processes, application logic, and more.

Cosmos SDK blockchains get interoperability out-of-the-box via a native integration with the [Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go). Ibc-go is implemented as a Go module in the Cosmos SDK. 

While the Cosmos SDK is plug-and-play with any consensus engine, we recommend using [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) for a fast, battle-tested, high-throughput, configurable BFT state machine. CometBFT is developed as part of the Cosmos Stack and its releases are updated alongside the SDK.

**WARNING**: The Cosmos SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some breaking changes.

## Quick Start

To learn how the Cosmos SDK works from a high-level perspective, see the Cosmos SDK [High-Level Intro](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/intro/overview).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of Cosmos SDK, visit [Cosmos SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network). You can also fork the tutorial&#039;s repository to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

Note: We advise to always use the latest maintained [Go version](https://go.dev/dl/) for building Cosmos SDK applications.

## Modules

The Cosmos SDK maintains a set of modules that can be included in your blockchain application.  For more information
on modules, see our [introduction doc](./x/README.md).

## Maintainers
[Cosmos Labs](https://cosmoslabs.io/) maintains the core components of the stack: Cosmos SDK, CometBFT, IBC, Cosmos EVM, and various developer tools and frameworks. The detailed maintenance policy can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/security/blob/main/POLICY.md). In addition to developing and maintaining the Cosmos Stack, Cosmos Labs provides advisory and engineering services for blockchain solutions. [Get in touch with Cosmos Labs](https://www.cosmoslabs.io/contact).

Cosmos Labs is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the [Interchain Foundation](https://interchain.io/), the Swiss nonprofit responsible for treasury management, funding public goods, and supporting governance for Cosmos. 

The Cosmos Stack is supported by a robust community of open-source contributors. 

## History
The Cosmos SDK was first released in 2019, and the first blockchain to use the SDK in production was the [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/main). Today, the Cosmos SDK is a popular, battle-tested, open-source framework used by hundreds of chains.

The Cosmos Hub still receives the most up-to-date Cosmos SDK versions. The Cosmos Hub application, `gaia`, has its own [cosmos/gaia repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; There is no stable version -- :construction: coming very soon!

## Pinned

:loudspeaker: [Stable Release &amp; 0.9.0 Update](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/discussions/1293)

:pushpin: [Read The Official Docs](https://filebrowserquantum.com/) (currently english-only)

## About

FileBrowser Quantum provides an easy way to access and manage your files from the web. It has a modern responsive interface that has many advanced features to manage users, access, sharing, and file preview and editing.

This version is called &quot;Quantum&quot; because it packs tons of advanced features into a tiny easy to run file. Unlike the majority of alternative options, FileBrowser Quantum is simple to install and easy to configure.

The goal for this repo is to become the best open-source self-hosted file browsing application that exists -- **all for free**. This repo will always be free and open-source.

Ready to try it out? See [Getting Started Docs](https://filebrowserquantum.com/en/docs/getting-started/).

## How its different

FileBrowser Quantum is a massive fork of the file browser open-source project with the following changes:

  1. ✅ Multiple sources support
  2. ✅ Login support for OIDC, password + 2FA, and proxy.
  3. ✅ Beautiful, Responsive, and Customizable user interface.
  4. ✅ Simplified configuration via `config.yaml` config file.
  5. ✅ Ultra-efficient [indexing](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/wiki/Indexing) and real-time updates
     - Real-time search results as you type.
     - Real-time monitoring and updates in the UI.
     - Search supports file and folder sizes, along with various filters.
  6. ✅ Better listing browsing
     - More file type previews, such as **office** and **video** file previews
     - Instantly switches view modes and sort order without reloading data.
     - Folder sizes are displayed.
     - Navigating remembers the last scroll position.
  7. ✅ Highly configurable and customizable sharing options, incuding:
     - share expiration time
     - users who can access share (including anonymous)
     - styling and themes
     - file viewing, editing, and uploading permissions
  8. ✅ Directory-level access control that can be scoped to user or group.
  8. ✅ Developer API support
     - Ability to create long-lived API Tokens.
     - A helpful Swagger page is available at `/swagger` endpoint for API enabled users.

Notable features that this fork *does not* have (removed):

 - :construction: jobs are not supported yet.
 - ❌ shell commands are completely removed and will not be returned.

FileBrowser Quantum differs significantly from the original version. Many of these changes required a significant overhaul. Creating a fork was a necessary process to make the program better. There have been many growing pains, but a stable release is planned and coming soon.

## System Requirements

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Every file and directory in the source gets indexed (by default). This enables powerful features such as instant search, but large source filesystems can increase your system requirements. [See indexing wiki](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/wiki/Indexing) for more info.

 - **Memory**: depends on configured source complexity. See [how much RAM does it require?](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/discussions/787)
 - **GPU**: Not currently used (planned)

## The UI

The UI has a simple three-component navigation system:

  1. (Left) Multi-action button with slide-out panel.
  2. (Middle) The powerful search bar.
  3. (Right) The view change toggle.

All other functions are moved either into the action menu or pop-up menus.
If the action does not depend on context, it will exist in the slide-out
action panel. If the action is available based on context, it will show up as
a pop-up menu.

## Why do you need Personal Cloud?

In 2020, the team noticed three important trends:
- The cost of computing power and storage was decreasing fast.
- A part of cloud computing was moving towards edge computing.
- The issue of consumer data asset ownership and attribution had been ignored.

Based on these trends, the team proposed a thought experiment internally: what if personal clouds were available under $100 in next five years? This personal cloud would provide a low-cost data collaboration solution as a personal data center, storing and managing data for creators and small organizations. A distributed collaborative computing network can be formed by personal servers located around the world. It could also control and connect all smart devices, providing cross-ecosystem local intelligent services.

Furthermore, the personal cloud could combine personal data to train personalized AI assistants. The idea is that this technology would be an effective way to solve the issue of consumer data asset ownership and , as well as provide a more affordable and efficient computing solution for individuals and small organizations.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io/update | sudo bash
```

To determine version of CasaOS from a terminal session run this command:

```sh
casaos -v
```



### Uninstall CasaOS

## Community 

The word Casa comes from the Spanish word for &quot;home&quot;. Project CasaOS originated as a pre-installed system for the crowdfunded product [ZimaBoard](https://www.zimaboard.com) on Kickstarter.

After looking at many systems and software on the market, the team found no server system designed for home scenarios, sadly true.

So, we set out to build this open-source project to develop CasaOS with our own hands, everyone in the community, and you.

We believe that through community-driven collaborative innovation and open communication with global developers, we can reshape the digital home experience like never before.

**ntfy** (pronounced &quot;*notify*&quot;) is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) 
notification service. With ntfy, you can **send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts** from any computer, 
**without having to sign up or pay any fees**. If you&#039;d like to run your own instance of the service, you can easily do 
so since ntfy is open source.

You can access the free version of ntfy at **[ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh)**. There is also an [open-source Android app](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android)
available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/),
as well as an [open source iOS app](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-ios) available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347).

## Introduction

The traditional method of providing web interfaces to Go programs is via a built-in web server. Wails offers a different
approach: it provides the ability to wrap both Go code and a web frontend into a single binary. Tools are provided to
make this easy for you by handling project creation, compilation and bundling. All you have to do is get creative!

## Features

- Use standard Go for the backend
- Use any frontend technology you are already familiar with to build your UI
- Quickly create rich frontends for your Go programs using pre-built templates
- Easily call Go methods from Javascript
- Auto-generated Typescript definitions for your Go structs and methods
- Native Dialogs &amp; Menus
- Native Dark / Light mode support
- Supports modern translucency and &quot;frosted window&quot; effects
- Unified eventing system between Go and Javascript
- Powerful cli tool to quickly generate and build your projects
- Multiplatform
- Uses native rendering engines - _no embedded browser_!

### Roadmap

The project roadmap may be found [here](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions/1484). Please consult
it before creating an enhancement request.

## Getting Started

The installation instructions are on the [official website](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).

&lt;/p&gt;

## FAQ

- Is this an alternative to Electron?

  Depends on your requirements. It&#039;s designed to make it easy for Go programmers to make lightweight desktop
  applications or add a frontend to their existing applications. Wails does offer native elements such as menus
  and dialogs, so it could be considered a lightweight electron alternative.

- Who is this project aimed at?

  Go programmers who want to bundle an HTML/JS/CSS frontend with their applications, without resorting to creating a
  server and opening a browser to view it.

- What&#039;s with the name?

  When I saw WebView, I thought &quot;What I really want is tooling around building a WebView app, a bit like Rails is to
  Ruby&quot;. So initially it was a play on words (Webview on Rails). It just so happened to also be a homophone of the
  English name for the [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) I am from. So it stuck.

Private WireGuard® networks made easy

## Overview

This repository contains the majority of Tailscale&#039;s open source code.
Notably, it includes the `tailscaled` daemon and
the `tailscale` CLI tool. The `tailscaled` daemon runs on Linux, Windows,
[macOS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants/), and to varying degrees
on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The Tailscale iOS and Android apps use this repo&#039;s
code, but this repo doesn&#039;t contain the mobile GUI code.

Other [Tailscale repos](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/repositories) of note:

* the Android app is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android
* the Synology package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology
* the QNAP package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-qpkg
* the Chocolatey packaging is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-chocolatey

For background on which parts of Tailscale are open source and why,
see [https://tailscale.com/opensource/](https://tailscale.com/opensource/).

## Using

We serve packages for a variety of distros and platforms at
[https://pkgs.tailscale.com](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/).

## Other clients

The [macOS, iOS, and Windows clients](https://tailscale.com/download)
use the code in this repository but additionally include small GUI
wrappers. The GUI wrappers on non-open source platforms are themselves
not open source.

## Building

We always require the latest Go release, currently Go 1.25. (While we build
releases with our [Go fork](https://github.com/tailscale/go/), its use is not
required.)

```
go install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}
```

If you&#039;re packaging Tailscale for distribution, use `build_dist.sh`
instead, to burn commit IDs and version info into the binaries:

```
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
```

If your distro has conventions that preclude the use of
`build_dist.sh`, please do the equivalent of what it does in your
distro&#039;s way, so that bug reports contain useful version information.

## Bugs

Please file any issues about this code or the hosted service on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).

## Contributing

PRs welcome! But please file bugs. Commit messages should [reference
bugs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls).

We require [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
`Signed-off-by` lines in commits.

See [commit-messages.md](docs/commit-messages.md) (or skim `git log`) for our commit message style.

## About Us

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is primarily developed by the
people at https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/people. For other contributors,

- Website: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform
- Forums: [HashiCorp Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
- Documentation: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs)
- Tutorials: [HashiCorp&#039;s Learn Platform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials)

&lt;img alt=&quot;Terraform&quot; src=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1731373310-terraform_white.svg&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.

## Getting Started &amp; Documentation

Documentation is available on the [Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform):

- [Introduction](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)
- [Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs)

If you&#039;re new to Terraform and want to get started creating infrastructure, please check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#getting-started) on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#operations-and-development) to continue your learning.

Show off your Terraform knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the [certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/) for information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/certification/terraform-associate) on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform.

## Developing Terraform

This repository contains only Terraform core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine. Providers are implemented as plugins, and Terraform can automatically download providers that are published on [the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io). HashiCorp develops some providers, and others are developed by other organizations. For more information, refer to [Plugin development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin).

- To learn more about compiling Terraform and contributing suggested changes, refer to [the contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

- To learn more about how we handle bug reports, refer to the [bug triage guide](./BUGPROCESS.md).

- To learn how to contribute to the Terraform documentation, refer to the [Web Unified Docs repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/web-unified-docs).

Gatus is a developer-oriented health dashboard that gives you the ability to monitor your services using HTTP, ICMP, TCP, and even DNS
queries as well as evaluate the result of said queries by using a list of conditions on values like the status code,
the response time, the certificate expiration, the body and many others. The icing on top is that each of these health
checks can be paired with alerting via Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Discord, Twilio and many more.

I personally deploy it in my Kubernetes cluster and let it monitor the status of my
core applications: https://status.twin.sh/

_Looking for a managed solution? Check out [Gatus.io](https://gatus.io)._

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick start&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

## Why Gatus?
Before getting into the specifics, I want to address the most common question:
&gt; Why would I use Gatus when I can just use Prometheus’ Alertmanager, Cloudwatch or even Splunk?

Neither of these can tell you that there’s a problem if there are no clients actively calling the endpoint.
In other words, it&#039;s because monitoring metrics mostly rely on existing traffic, which effectively means that unless
your clients are already experiencing a problem, you won&#039;t be notified.

Gatus, on the other hand, allows you to configure health checks for each of your features, which in turn allows it to
monitor these features and potentially alert you before any clients are impacted.

A sign you may want to look into Gatus is by simply asking yourself whether you&#039;d receive an alert if your load balancer
was to go down right now. Will any of your existing alerts be triggered? Your metrics won’t report an increase in errors
if no traffic makes it to your applications. This puts you in a situation where your clients are the ones
that will notify you about the degradation of your services rather than you reassuring them that you&#039;re working on
fixing the issue before they even know about it.


## Features
The main features of Gatus are:

- **Highly flexible health check conditions**: While checking the response status may be enough for some use cases, Gatus goes much further and allows you to add conditions on the response time, the response body and even the IP address.
- **Ability to use Gatus for user acceptance tests**: Thanks to the point above, you can leverage this application to create automated user acceptance tests.
- **Very easy to configure**: Not only is the configuration designed to be as readable as possible, it&#039;s also extremely easy to add a new service or a new endpoint to monitor.
- **Alerting**: While having a pretty visual dashboard is useful to keep track of the state of your application(s), you probably don&#039;t want to stare at it all day. Thus, notifications via Slack, Mattermost, Messagebird, PagerDuty, Twilio, Google chat and Teams are supported out of the box with the ability to configure a custom alerting provider for any needs you might have, whether it be a different provider or a custom application that manages automated rollbacks.
- **Metrics**
- **Low resource consumption**: As with most Go applications, the resource footprint that this application requires is negligibly small.

## Usage

```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name gatus ghcr.io/twin/gatus:stable
```

You can also use Docker Hub if you prefer:
```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name gatus twinproduction/gatus:stable
```
If you want to create your own configuration, see [Docker](#docker) for information on how to mount a configuration file.

Here&#039;s a simple example:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: website                 # Name of your endpoint, can be anything
    url: &quot;https://twin.sh/health&quot;
    interval: 5m                  # Duration to wait between every status check (default: 60s)
    conditions:
      - &quot;[STATUS] == 200&quot;         # Status must be 200
      - &quot;[BODY].status == UP&quot;     # The json path &quot;$.status&quot; must be equal to UP
      - &quot;[RESPONSE_TIME] &lt; 300&quot;   # Response time must be under 300ms

  - name: make-sure-header-is-rendered
    url: &quot;https://example.org/&quot;
    interval: 60s
    conditions:
      - &quot;[STATUS] == 200&quot;                          # Status must be 200
      - &quot;[BODY] == pat(*&lt;h1&gt;Example Domain&lt;/h1&gt;*)&quot; # Body must contain the specified header
```

This example would look similar to this:

![Simple example](.github/assets/example.jpg)

By default, the configuration file is expected to be at `config/config.yaml`.

You can specify a custom path by setting the `GATUS_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

If `GATUS_CONFIG_PATH` points to a directory, all `*.yaml` and `*.yml` files inside said directory and its
subdirectories are merged like so:
- All maps/objects are deep merged (i.e. you could define `alerting.slack` in one file and `alerting.pagerduty` in another file)
- All slices/arrays are appended (i.e. you can define `endpoints` in multiple files and each endpoint will be added to the final list of endpoints)
- Parameters with a primitive value (e.g. `metrics`, `alerting.slack.webhook-url`, etc.) may only be defined once to forcefully avoid any ambiguity
    - To clarify, this also means that you could not define `alerting.slack.webhook-url` in two files with different values. All files are merged into one before they are processed. This is by design.

&gt; 💡 You can also use environment variables in the configuration file (e.g. `$DOMAIN`, `${DOMAIN}`)
&gt;
&gt; See [examples/docker-compose-postgres-storage/config/config.yaml](.examples/docker-compose-postgres-storage/config/config.yaml) for an example.
&gt;
&gt; When your configuration parameter contains a `$` symbol, you have to escape `$` with `$$`.

If you want to test it locally, see [Docker](#docker).

If you want more verbose logging, you may set the `GATUS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG`.
Conversely, if you want less verbose logging, you can set the aforementioned environment variable to `WARN`, `ERROR` or `FATAL`.
The default value for `GATUS_LOG_LEVEL` is `INFO`.

# Quick Start #

## Quick Start for S3 API on Docker ##

`docker run -p 8333:8333 chrislusf/seaweedfs server -s3`

## Quick Start with Single Binary ##
* Download the latest binary from https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/releases and unzip a single binary file `weed` or `weed.exe`. Or run `go install github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed@latest`.
* `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin ; export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=key` as the admin credentials to access the object store.
* Run `weed server -dir=/some/data/dir -s3` to start one master, one volume server, one filer, and one S3 gateway.

Also, to increase capacity, just add more volume servers by running `weed volume -dir=&quot;/some/data/dir2&quot; -mserver=&quot;&lt;master_host&gt;:9333&quot; -port=8081` locally, or on a different machine, or on thousands of machines. That is it!

# Introduction #

SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

1. to store billions of files!
2. to serve the files fast!

SeaweedFS started as an Object Store to handle small files efficiently. 
Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, 
the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, 
and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. 
This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, 
allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation).

There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file&#039;s metadata. 
It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases.

SeaweedFS started by implementing [Facebook&#039;s Haystack design paper](http://www.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf). 
Also, SeaweedFS implements erasure coding with ideas from 
[f4: Facebook’s Warm BLOB Storage System](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-muralidhar.pdf), and has a lot of similarities with [Facebook’s Tectonic Filesystem](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast21-pan.pdf)

On top of the object store, optional [Filer] can support directories and POSIX attributes. 
Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, 
e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc.

For any distributed key value stores, the large values can be offloaded to SeaweedFS. 
With the fast access speed and linearly scalable capacity, 
SeaweedFS can work as a distributed [Key-Large-Value store][KeyLargeValueStore].

SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud. 
With hot data on local cluster, and warm data on the cloud with O(1) access time, 
SeaweedFS can achieve both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity.
What&#039;s more, the cloud storage access API cost is minimized. 
Faster and cheaper than direct cloud storage!

## Example: Using Seaweed Object Store ##

By default, the master node runs on port 9333, and the volume nodes run on port 8080.
Let&#039;s start one master node, and two volume nodes on port 8080 and 8081. Ideally, they should be started from different machines. We&#039;ll use localhost as an example.

SeaweedFS uses HTTP REST operations to read, write, and delete. The responses are in JSON or JSONP format.

### Start Master Server ###

```
&gt; ./weed master
```

### Start Volume Servers ###

```
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data1&quot; -max=5  -mserver=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8080 &amp;
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data2&quot; -max=10 -mserver=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8081 &amp;
```

### Write File ###

To upload a file: first, send a HTTP POST, PUT, or GET request to `/dir/assign` to get an `fid` and a volume server URL:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign
{&quot;count&quot;:1,&quot;fid&quot;:&quot;3,01637037d6&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;,&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}
```

Second, to store the file content, send a HTTP multi-part POST request to `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` from the response:

```
&gt; curl -F file=@/home/chris/myphoto.jpg http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;myphoto.jpg&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:43234,&quot;eTag&quot;:&quot;1cc0118e&quot;}
```

To update, send another POST request with updated file content.

For deletion, send an HTTP DELETE request to the same `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` URL:

```
&gt; curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
```

### Save File Id ###

Now, you can save the `fid`, 3,01637037d6 in this case, to a database field.

The number 3 at the start represents a volume id. After the comma, it&#039;s one file key, 01, and a file cookie, 637037d6.

The volume id is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The file key is an unsigned 64-bit integer. The file cookie is an unsigned 32-bit integer, used to prevent URL guessing.

The file key and file cookie are both coded in hex. You can store the &lt;volume id, file key, file cookie&gt; tuple in your own format, or simply store the `fid` as a string.

If stored as a string, in theory, you would need 8+1+16+8=33 bytes. A char(33) would be enough, if not more than enough, since most uses will not need 2^32 volumes.

If space is really a concern, you can store the file id in your own format. You would need one 4-byte integer for volume id, 8-byte long number for file key, and a 4-byte integer for the file cookie. So 16 bytes are more than enough.

### Read File ###

Here is an example of how to render the URL.

First look up the volume server&#039;s URLs by the file&#039;s volumeId:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/lookup?volumeId=3
{&quot;volumeId&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}]}
```

Since (usually) there are not too many volume servers, and volumes don&#039;t move often, you can cache the results most of the time. Depending on the replication type, one volume can have multiple replica locations. Just randomly pick one location to read.

Now you can take the public URL, render the URL or directly read from the volume server via URL:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
```

Notice we add a file extension &quot;.jpg&quot; here. It&#039;s optional and just one way for the client to specify the file content type.

If you want a nicer URL, you can use one of these alternative URL formats:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6/my_preferred_name.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6
```

If you want to get a scaled version of an image, you can add some params:

```
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fit
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fill
```

### Rack-Aware and Data Center-Aware Replication ###

SeaweedFS applies the replication strategy at a volume level. So, when you are getting a file id, you can specify the replication strategy. For example:

```
curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?replication=001
```

The replication parameter options are:

```
000: no replication
001: replicate once on the same rack
010: replicate once on a different rack, but same data center
100: replicate once on a different data center
200: replicate twice on two different data center
110: replicate once on a different rack, and once on a different data center
```

More details about replication can be found [on the wiki][Replication].

[Replication]: https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Replication

You can also set the default replication strategy when starting the master server.

### Allocate File Key on Specific Data Center ###

Volume servers can be started with a specific data center name:

```
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/1 -port=8080 -dataCenter=dc1
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/2 -port=8081 -dataCenter=dc2
```

When requesting a file key, an optional &quot;dataCenter&quot; parameter can limit the assigned volume to the specific data center. For example, this specifies that the assigned volume should be limited to &#039;dc1&#039;:

```
 http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?dataCenter=dc1
```

## Object Store Architecture ##

Usually distributed file systems split each file into chunks, a central master keeps a mapping of filenames, chunk indices to chunk handles, and also which chunks each chunk server has.

The main drawback is that the central master can&#039;t handle many small files efficiently, and since all read requests need to go through the chunk master, so it might not scale well for many concurrent users.

Instead of managing chunks, SeaweedFS manages data volumes in the master server. Each data volume is 32GB in size, and can hold a lot of files. And each storage node can have many data volumes. So the master node only needs to store the metadata about the volumes, which is a fairly small amount of data and is generally stable.

The actual file metadata is stored in each volume on volume servers. Since each volume server only manages metadata of files on its own disk, with only 16 bytes for each file, all file access can read file metadata just from memory and only needs one disk operation to actually read file data.

For comparison, consider that an xfs inode structure in Linux is 536 bytes.

### Master Server and Volume Server ###

The architecture is fairly simple. The actual data is stored in volumes on storage nodes. One volume server can have multiple volumes, and can both support read and write access with basic authentication.

All volumes are managed by a master server. The master server contains the volume id to volume server mapping. This is fairly static information, and can be easily cached.

On each write request, the master server also generates a file key, which is a growing 64-bit unsigned integer. Since write requests are not generally as frequent as read requests, one master server should be able to handle the concurrency well.

### Write and Read files ###

When a client sends a write request, the master server returns (volume id, file key, file cookie, volume node URL) for the file. The client then contacts the volume node and POSTs the file content.

When a client needs to read a file based on (volume id, file key, file cookie), it asks the master server by the volume id for t

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most
painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across **all** the platforms and
architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and
Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.
This project has been
[forked](https://blog.gitea.com/welcome-to-gitea/) from
[Gogs](https://gogs.io) since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit [demo.gitea.com](https://demo.gitea.com).

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit [gitea.com](https://gitea.com/user/login).

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at [cloud.gitea.com](https://cloud.gitea.com).

## Documentation

You can find comprehensive documentation on our official [documentation website](https://docs.gitea.com/).

It includes installation, administration, usage, development, contributing guides, and more to help you get started and explore all features effectively.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to it, you can visit the [documentation repository](https://gitea.com/gitea/docs)

## Building

From the root of the source tree, run:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata&quot; make build

or if SQLite support is required:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify&quot; make build

The `build` target is split into two sub-targets:

- `make backend` which requires [Go Stable](https://go.dev/dl/), the required version is defined in [go.mod](/go.mod).
- `make frontend` which requires [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Internet connectivity is required to download the go and npm modules. When building from the official source tarballs which include pre-built frontend files, the `frontend` target will not be triggered, making it possible to build without Node.js.

More info: https://docs.gitea.com/installation/install-from-source

## Using

After building, a binary file named `gitea` will be generated in the root of the source tree by default. To run it, use:

    ./gitea web

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re interested in using our APIs, we have experimental support with [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/api).

## Contributing

Expected workflow is: Fork -&gt; Patch -&gt; Push -&gt; Pull Request

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; 1. **YOU MUST READ THE [CONTRIBUTORS GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md) BEFORE STARTING TO WORK ON A PULL REQUEST.**
&gt; 2. If you have found a vulnerability in the project, please write privately to **security@gitea.io**. Thanks!

## Translating

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/gitea/localized.svg)](https://translate.gitea.com)

Translations are done through [Crowdin](https://translate.gitea.com). If you want to translate to a new language, ask one of the managers in the Crowdin project to add a new language there.

You can also just create an issue for adding a language or ask on Discord on the #translation channel. If you need context or find some translation issues, you can leave a comment on the string or ask on Discord. For general translation questions there is a section in the docs. Currently a bit empty, but we hope to fill it as questions pop up.

Get more information from [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/contributing/localization).

## Official and Third-Party Projects

We provide an official [go-sdk](https://gitea.com/gitea/go-sdk), a CLI tool called [tea](https://gitea.com/gitea/tea) and an [action runner](https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner) for Gitea Action.

We maintain a list of Gitea-related projects at [gitea/awesome-gitea](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea), where you can discover more third-party projects, including SDKs, plugins, themes, and more.

## Credits

- [Xray-core v1.0.0](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was forked from [v2fly-core 9a03cc5](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/commit/9a03cc5c98d04cc28320fcee26dbc236b3291256), and we have made &amp; accumulated a huge number of enhancements over time, check [the release notes for each version](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases).
- For third-party projects used in [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core), check your local or [the latest go.mod](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/blob/main/go.mod).

## One-line Compilation

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED=0
go build -o xray.exe -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Reproducible Releases

Make sure that you are using the same Go version, and remember to set the git commit id (7 bytes):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;all=-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

If you are compiling a 32-bit MIPS/MIPSLE target, use this command instead:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

&gt; For more examples, see [./docs/examples](./docs/examples).

## Quickstart

The most convenient way to use D2 is to just run it as a CLI executable to
produce SVGs from `.d2` files.

```sh
# First, install D2
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s --

echo &#039;x -&gt; y -&gt; z&#039; &gt; in.d2
d2 --watch in.d2 out.svg
```

A browser window will open with `out.svg` and live-reload on changes to `in.d2`.

## Install

The easiest way to install is with our install script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s --
```

You can run the install script with `--dry-run` to see the commands that will be used
to install without executing them.

Or if you have Go installed you can install from source though you won&#039;t get the manpage:

```sh
go install oss.terrastruct.com/d2@latest
```

You can also install a release from source which will include manpages.
See [./docs/INSTALL.md#source-release](./docs/INSTALL.md#source-release).

To uninstall with the install script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

For detailed installation docs, see [./docs/INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md).
We demonstrate alternative methods and examples for each OS.

As well, the functioning of the install script is described in detail to alleviate any
concern of its use. We recommend using your OS&#039;s package manager directly instead for
improved security but the install script is by no means insecure.

## D2 as a library

In addition to being a runnable CLI tool, D2 can also be used to produce diagrams from
Go programs.

For examples, see [./docs/examples/lib](./docs/examples/lib). This [blog
post](https://terrastruct.com/blog/post/generate-diagrams-programmatically/) also demos a
complete, runnable example of using D2 as a library for a real-world use case.

## Themes

D2 includes a variety of official themes to style your diagrams beautifully right out of
the box. See [./d2themes](./d2themes) to browse the available themes and make or
contribute your own creation.

## Fonts

D2 ships with &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot; as the font in renders. If you wish to use a different
one, please see [./d2renderers/d2fonts](./d2renderers/d2fonts).

## Export file types

D2 currently supports SVG, PNG and PDF exports. More coming soon.

## Language tooling

D2 is designed with language tooling in mind. D2&#039;s parser can parse multiple errors from a
broken program, has an autoformatter, syntax highlighting, and we have plans for LSP&#039;s and
more. Good language tooling is necessary for creating and maintaining large diagrams.

The extensions for VSCode and Vim can be found in the [Related](#related) section.

## Plugins

D2 is designed to be extensible and composable. The plugin system allows you to
change out layout engines and customize the rendering pipeline. Plugins can either be
bundled with the build or separately installed as a standalone binary.

**Layout engines**:

- [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) (default, bundled): A fast, directed graph
  layout engine that produces layered/hierarchical layouts. Based on Graphviz&#039;s DOT
  algorithm.
- [ELK](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) (bundled): A directed graph layout engine
  particularly suited for node-link diagrams with an inherent direction and ports.
- [TALA](https://github.com/terrastruct/TALA) (binary): Novel layout engine designed
  specifically for software architecture diagrams. Requires separate install, visit the
  Github page for more.

D2 intends to integrate with a variety of layout engines, e.g. `dot`, as well as
single-purpose layout types like sequence diagrams. You can choose whichever layout engine
you like and works best for the diagram you&#039;re making.
