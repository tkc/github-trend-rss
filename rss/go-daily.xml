Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework that applies software development principles to AI agent creation. It is designed to simplify building, deploying, and orchestrating agent workflows, from simple tasks to complex systems. While optimized for Gemini, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and compatible with other frameworks.

This Go version of ADK is ideal for developers building cloud-native agent applications, leveraging Go&#039;s strengths in concurrency and performance.

The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct [receiver integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#receiver) such as email, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or many other [mechanisms](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#alertmanager-webhook-receiver) thanks to the webhook receiver. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

* [Documentation](http://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/)

## Install

There are various ways of installing Alertmanager.

### Precompiled binaries

Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the
[*download* section](https://prometheus.io/download/)
on [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io). Using the latest production release binary
is the recommended way of installing Alertmanager.

### Docker images

Docker images are available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/alertmanager) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/alertmanager/).

You can launch an Alertmanager container for trying it out with

    $ docker run --name alertmanager -d -p 127.0.0.1:9093:9093 quay.io/prometheus/alertmanager

Alertmanager will now be reachable at http://localhost:9093/.

### Compiling the binary

You can either `go install` it:

```
$ go install github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/cmd/...@latest
# cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus/alertmanager
$ alertmanager --config.file=&lt;your_file&gt;
```

Or clone the repository and build manually:

```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
$ git clone https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager.git
$ cd alertmanager
$ make build
$ ./alertmanager --config.file=&lt;your_file&gt;
```

You can also build just one of the binaries in this repo by passing a name to the build function:
```
$ make build BINARIES=amtool
```

## Example

This is an example configuration that should cover most relevant aspects of the new YAML configuration format. The full documentation of the configuration can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/).

```yaml
global:
  # The smarthost and SMTP sender used for mail notifications.
  smtp_smarthost: &#039;localhost:25&#039;
  smtp_from: &#039;alertmanager@example.org&#039;

# The root route on which each incoming alert enters.
route:
  # The root route must not have any matchers as it is the entry point for
  # all alerts. It needs to have a receiver configured so alerts that do not
  # match any of the sub-routes are sent to someone.
  receiver: &#039;team-X-mails&#039;

  # The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
  # multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
  # be batched into a single group.
  #
  # To aggregate by all possible labels use &#039;...&#039; as the sole label name.
  # This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all
  # alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have
  # a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs
  # its own grouping. Example: group_by: [...]
  group_by: [&#039;alertname&#039;, &#039;cluster&#039;]

  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at
  # least &#039;group_wait&#039; to send the initial notification.
  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start
  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first
  # notification.
  group_wait: 30s

  # When the first notification was sent, wait &#039;group_interval&#039; to send a batch
  # of new alerts that started firing for that group.
  group_interval: 5m

  # If an alert has successfully been sent, wait &#039;repeat_interval&#039; to
  # resend them.
  repeat_interval: 3h

  # All the above attributes are inherited by all child routes and can
  # overwritten on each.

  # The child route trees.
  routes:
  # This route performs a regular expression match on alert labels to
  # catch alerts that are related to a list of services.
  - matchers:
    - service=~&quot;^(foo1|foo2|baz)$&quot;
    receiver: team-X-mails

    # The service has a sub-route for critical alerts, any alerts
    # that do not match, i.e. severity != critical, fall-back to the
    # parent node and are sent to &#039;team-X-mails&#039;
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - severity=&quot;critical&quot;
      receiver: team-X-pager

  - matchers:
    - service=&quot;files&quot;
    receiver: team-Y-mails

    routes:
    - matchers:
      - severity=&quot;critical&quot;
      receiver: team-Y-pager

  # This route handles all alerts coming from a database service. If there&#039;s
  # no team to handle it, it defaults to the DB team.
  - matchers:
    - service=&quot;database&quot;

    receiver: team-DB-pager
    # Also group alerts by affected database.
    group_by: [alertname, cluster, database]

    routes:
    - matchers:
      - owner=&quot;team-X&quot;
      receiver: team-X-pager

    - matchers:
      - owner=&quot;team-Y&quot;
      receiver: team-Y-pager


# Inhibition rules allow to mute a set of alerts given that another alert is
# firing.
# We use this to mute any warning-level notifications if the same alert is
# already critical.
inhibit_rules:
- source_matchers:
    - severity=&quot;critical&quot;
  target_matchers:
    - severity=&quot;warning&quot;
  # Apply inhibition if the alertname is the same.
  # CAUTION: 
  #   If all label names listed in `equal` are missing 
  #   from both the source and target alerts,
  #   the inhibition rule will apply!
  equal: [&#039;alertname&#039;]

## API

The current Alertmanager API is version 2. This API is fully generated via the
[OpenAPI project](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)
and [Go Swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/) with the exception
of the HTTP handlers themselves. The API specification can be found in
[api/v2/openapi.yaml](api/v2/openapi.yaml). A HTML rendered version can be
accessed [here](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus/alertmanager/main/api/v2/openapi.yaml).
Clients can be easily generated via any OpenAPI generator for all major languages.

APIv2 is accessed via the `/api/v2` prefix. APIv1 was deprecated in `0.16.0` and is removed as of version `0.27.0`.
The v2 `/status` endpoint would be `/api/v2/status`. If `--web.route-prefix` is set then API routes are
prefixed with that as well, so `--web.route-prefix=/alertmanager/` would
relate to `/alertmanager/api/v2/status`.

## amtool

`amtool` is a cli tool for interacting with the Alertmanager API. It is bundled with all releases of Alertmanager.

### Install

Alternatively you can install with:
```
$ go install github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/cmd/amtool@latest
```

### Examples

View all currently firing alerts:
```
$ amtool alert
Alertname        Starts At                Summary
Test_Alert       2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!
Test_Alert       2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!
Check_Foo_Fails  2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!
Check_Foo_Fails  2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!
```

View all currently firing alerts with extended output:
```
$ amtool -o extended alert
Labels                                        Annotations                                                    Starts At                Ends At                  Generator URL
alertname=&quot;Test_Alert&quot; instance=&quot;node0&quot;       link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local
alertname=&quot;Test_Alert&quot; instance=&quot;node1&quot;       link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local
alertname=&quot;Check_Foo_Fails&quot; instance=&quot;node0&quot;  link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local
alertname=&quot;Check_Foo_Fails&quot; instance=&quot;node1&quot;  link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local
```

In addition to viewing alerts, you can use the rich query syntax provided by Alertmanager:
```
$ amtool -o extended alert query alertname=&quot;Test_Alert&quot;
Labels                                   Annotations                                                    Starts At                Ends At                  Generator URL
alertname=&quot;Test_Alert&quot; instance=&quot;node0&quot;  link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local

Try out how a template works. Let&#039;s say you have this in your configuration file:
```
templates:
  - &#039;/foo/bar/*.tmpl&#039;
```

Then you can test out how a template would look like with example by using this command:
```
amtool template render --template.glob=&#039;/foo/bar/*.tmpl&#039; --template.text=&#039;{{ template &quot;slack.default.markdown.v1&quot; . }}&#039;
```

### Configuration

`amtool` allows a configuration file to specify some options for convenience. The default configuration file paths are `$HOME/.config/amtool/config.yml` or `/etc/amtool/config.yml`

An example configuration file might look like the following:

```
# Define the path that `amtool` can find your `alertmanager` instance
alertmanager.url: &quot;http://localhost:9093&quot;

# Override the default author. (unset defaults to your username)
author: me@example.com

# Force amtool to give you an error if you don&#039;t include a comment on a silence
comment_required: true

# Set a default output format. (unset defaults to simple)
output: extended

# Set a default receiver
receiver: team-X-pager
```

### Routes

`amtool` allows you to visualize the routes of your configuration in form of text tree view.
Also you can use it to test the routing by passing it label set of an alert
and it prints out all receivers the alert would match ordered and separated by `,`.
(If you use `--verify.receivers` amtool returns error code 1 on mismatch)

Example of usage:
```
# View routing tree of remote Alertmanager
$ amtool config routes --alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9090

# Test if alert matches expected receiver
$ amtool config routes test --config.file=doc/examples/simple.yml --tree --verify.receivers=team-X-pager service=database owner=team-X
```

## High Availability

Alertmanager&#039;s high availability is in production use at many companies and is enabled by default.

&gt; Important: Both UDP and TCP are needed in alertmanager 0.15 and higher for the cluster to work.
&gt;  - If you are using a firewall, make sure to whitelist the clustering port for both protocols.
&gt;  - If you are running in a container, make sure to expose the clustering port for both protocols.

To create a highly available cluster of the Alertmanager the instances need to
be configured to communicate with each other. This is configured using the
`--cluster.*` flags.

- `--cluster.listen-address` string: cluster listen address (default &quot;0.0.0.0:9094&quot;; empty string disables HA mode)
- `--cluster.advertise-address` string: cluster advertise address
- `--cluster.peer` value: initial peers (repeat flag for each additional peer)
- `--cluster.peer-timeout` value: peer timeout period (default &quot;15s&quot;)
- `--cluster.peers-resolve-timeout` value: peers resolve timeout period (default &quot;15s&quot;)
- `--cluster.gossip-interval` value: cluster message propagation speed
  (default &quot;200ms&quot;)
- `--cluster.pushpull-interval` value: lower values will increase
  convergence speeds at expense of bandwidth (default &quot;1m0s&quot;)
- `--cluster.settle-timeout` value: maximum time to wait for cluster
  connections to settle before evaluating notifications.
- `--cluster.tcp-timeout` value: timeout value for tcp connections, reads and writes (default &quot;10s&quot;)
- `--cluster.probe-timeout` value: time to wait for ack before marking node unhealthy
  (default &quot;500ms&quot;)
- `--cluster.probe-interval` value: interval between random node probes (default &quot;1s&quot;)
- `--cluster.reconnect-interval` value: interval between attempting to reconnect to lost peers (default &quot;10s&quot;)
- `--cluster.reconnect-timeout` value: length of time to attempt to reconnect to a lost peer (default: &quot;6h0m0s&quot;)
- `--cluster.label` value: the label is an optional string to include on each packet and stream. It uniquely identifies the cluster and prevents cross-communication issues when sending gossip messages (default:&quot;&quot;)

The chosen port in the `cluster.listen-address` flag is the port that needs to be
specified in the `cluster.peer` flag of the other peers.

The `cluster.advertise-address` flag is required if the instance doesn&#039;t have
an IP address that is part of [RFC 6890](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6890)
with a default route.

To start a cluster of three peers on your local machine use [`goreman`](https://github.com/mattn/goreman) and the
Procfile within this repository.

	goreman start

To point your Prometheus 1.4, or later, instance to multiple Alertmanagers, configure them
in your `prometheus.yml` configuration file, for example:

```yaml
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets:
      - alertmanager1:9093
      - alertmanager2:9093
      - alertmanager3:9093
```

&gt; Important: Do not load balance traffic between Prometheus and its Alertmanagers, but instead point Prometheus to a list of all Alertmanagers. The Alertmanager implementation expects all alerts to be sent to all Alertmanagers to ensure high availability.

### Turn off high availability

If running Alertmanager in high availability mode is not desired, setting `--cluster.listen-address=` prevents Alertmanager from listening to incoming peer requests.

# Lima: Linux Machines

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/lima-vm/lima)
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/6505/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/6505)
[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/lima-vm/lima/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/lima-vm/lima)

[Lima](https://lima-vm.io/) launches Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing and port forwarding (similar to WSL2).

The original goal of Lima was to promote [containerd](https://containerd.io) including [nerdctl (contaiNERD ctl)](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)
to Mac users, but Lima can be used for non-container applications as well.

Lima also supports other container engines (Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, etc.) and non-macOS hosts (Linux, NetBSD, etc.).

## Getting started
Set up (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install lima
limactl start
```

To run Linux commands:
```bash
lima uname -a
```

To run containers with containerd:
```bash
lima nerdctl run --rm hello-world
```

To run containers with Docker:
```bash
limactl start template://docker
export DOCKER_HOST=$(limactl list docker --format &#039;unix://{{.Dir}}/sock/docker.sock&#039;)
docker run --rm hello-world
```

To run containers with Kubernetes:
```bash
limactl start template://k8s
export KUBECONFIG=$(limactl list k8s --format &#039;unix://{{.Dir}}/copied-from-guest/kubeconfig.yaml&#039;)
kubectl apply -f ...
```

# NexaSDK - Run any AI model on any backend

NexaSDK is an easy-to-use developer toolkit for running any AI model locally — across NPUs, GPUs, and CPUs — powered by our NexaML engine, built entirely from scratch for peak performance on every hardware stack. Unlike wrappers that depend on existing runtimes, NexaML is a unified inference engine built at the kernel level. It’s what lets NexaSDK achieve Day-0 support for new model architectures (LLMs, multimodal, audio, vision). NexaML supports 3 model formats: GGUF, MLX, and Nexa AI&#039;s own `.nexa` format.

# Quick Start

## Step 1: Download Nexa CLI with one click

### macOS

- [arm64 with Apple Neural Engine support](https://public-storage.nexa4ai.com/nexa_sdk/downloads/nexa-cli_macos_arm64.pkg)
- [x86_64](https://public-storage.nexa4ai.com/nexa_sdk/downloads/nexa-cli_macos_x86_64.pkg)

### Windows

- [arm64 with Qualcomm NPU support](https://public-storage.nexa4ai.com/nexa_sdk/downloads/nexa-cli_windows_arm64.exe)
- [x86_64 with Intel / AMD NPU support](https://public-storage.nexa4ai.com/nexa_sdk/downloads/nexa-cli_windows_x86_64.exe)

### Linux

#### For x86_64:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/releases/latest/download/nexa-cli_linux_x86_64.sh -o install.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x install.sh &amp;&amp; ./install.sh &amp;&amp; rm install.sh
```

#### For arm64:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/releases/latest/download/nexa-cli_linux_arm64.sh -o install.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x install.sh &amp;&amp; ./install.sh &amp;&amp; rm install.sh
```

## Step 2: Run models with one line of code

You can run any compatible GGUF, MLX, or nexa model from 🤗 Hugging Face by using the `nexa infer &lt;full repo name&gt;`.

### GGUF models

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; GGUF runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows on CPU/GPU. Note certain GGUF models are only supported by NexaSDK (e.g. Qwen3-VL-4B and 8B).

📝 Run and chat with LLMs, e.g. Qwen3:

```bash
nexa infer ggml-org/Qwen3-1.7B-GGUF
```

🖼️ Run and chat with Multimodal models, e.g. Qwen3-VL-4B:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-GGUF
```

### MLX models

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; MLX is macOS-only (Apple Silicon). Many MLX models in the Hugging Face mlx-community organization have quality issues and may not run reliably.
&gt; We recommend starting with models from our curated [NexaAI Collection](https://huggingface.co/NexaAI/collections) for best results. For example

📝 Run and chat with LLMs, e.g. Qwen3:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/Qwen3-4B-4bit-MLX
```

🖼️ Run and chat with Multimodal models, e.g. Gemma3n:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/gemma-3n-E4B-it-4bit-MLX
```

### Qualcomm NPU models

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You need to download the [arm64 with Qualcomm NPU support](https://public-storage.nexa4ai.com/nexa_sdk/downloads/nexa-cli_windows_arm64.exe) and make sure you have Snapdragon® X Elite chip on your laptop.

#### Quick Start (Windows arm64, Snapdragon X Elite)

1. **Login &amp; Get Access Token (required for Pro Models)**

   - Create an account at [sdk.nexa.ai](https://sdk.nexa.ai)
   - Go to **Deployment → Create Token**
   - Run this once in your terminal (replace with your token):
     ```bash
     nexa config set license &#039;&lt;your_token_here&gt;&#039;
     ```

2. Run and chat with our multimodal model, OmniNeural-4B, or other models on NPU

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/OmniNeural-4B
nexa infer NexaAI/Granite-4-Micro-NPU
nexa infer NexaAI/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-NPU
```

## CLI Reference

| Essential Command                   | What it does                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `nexa -h`                           | show all CLI commands                    |
| `nexa pull &lt;repo&gt;`                  | Interactive download &amp; cache of a model  |
| `nexa infer &lt;repo&gt;`                 | Local inference                          |
| `nexa list`                         | Show all cached models with sizes        |
| `nexa remove &lt;repo&gt;` / `nexa clean` | Delete one / all cached models           |
| `nexa serve --host 127.0.0.1:8080`  | Launch OpenAI‑compatible REST server     |
| `nexa run &lt;repo&gt;`                   | Chat with a model via an existing server |

👉 To interact with multimodal models, you can drag photos or audio clips directly into the CLI — you can even drop multiple images at once!

See [CLI Reference](https://nexaai.mintlify.app/nexa-sdk-go/NexaCLI) for full commands.

### Import model from local filesystem

```bash
# hf download &lt;model&gt; --local-dir /path/to/modeldir
nexa pull &lt;model&gt; --model-hub localfs --local-path /path/to/modeldir
```

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Missing --help, --init. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 5.8. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | in progress | Mostly complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit not complete. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled. |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps. |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Some functionality (errors, hover, go to def, refs, sig help). More features coming soon. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.

&lt;br/&gt;

**k6** is a modern load-testing tool, built on [our years of experience](https://k6.io/about) in the performance and testing industries.
It&#039;s built to be powerful, extensible, and full-featured. The key design goal is to provide **the best developer experience**.

Its core features are:

- **Configurable load generation.** Even lower-end machines can simulate lots of traffic.
- **Tests as code.** Reuse scripts, modularize logic, version control, and integrate tests with your CI.
- **A full-featured API.** The scripting API is packed with features that help you simulate real application traffic.
- **An embedded JavaScript engine.** The performance of Go, the scripting familiarity of JavaScript.
- **Multiple Protocol support**. HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, Browser, and more.
- **Large extension ecosystem.** You can extend k6 to support your needs. And many people have already shared their extensions with the community!
- **Flexible metrics storage and visualization**. Summary statistics or granular metrics, exported to the service of your choice.
- **Native integration with Grafana cloud**. [SaaS solution](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/k6/) for test execution, metrics correlation, data analysis, and more.

This is what load testing looks like in the 21st century.

## Example script


```js
import http from &quot;k6/http&quot;;
import { check, sleep } from &quot;k6&quot;;

// Test configuration
export const options = {
  thresholds: {
    // Assert that 99% of requests finish within 3000ms.
    http_req_duration: [&quot;p(99) &lt; 3000&quot;],
  },
  // Ramp the number of virtual users up and down
  stages: [
    { duration: &quot;30s&quot;, target: 15 },
    { duration: &quot;1m&quot;, target: 15 },
    { duration: &quot;20s&quot;, target: 0 },
  ],
};

// Simulated user behavior
export default function () {
  let res = http.get(&quot;https://quickpizza.grafana.com&quot;);
  // Validate response status
  check(res, { &quot;status was 200&quot;: (r) =&gt; r.status == 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```

You can run scripts like this on the CLI, or in your CI, or across a Kubernetes cluster.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Don&#039;t want to write code ?
&gt; 
&gt; We got you! Meet [k6 Studio](https://github.com/grafana/k6-studio), a desktop application made to help you generate k6 scripts without having to touch code!

## Introduction

The traditional method of providing web interfaces to Go programs is via a built-in web server. Wails offers a different
approach: it provides the ability to wrap both Go code and a web frontend into a single binary. Tools are provided to
make this easy for you by handling project creation, compilation and bundling. All you have to do is get creative!

## Features

- Use standard Go for the backend

### Roadmap

The project roadmap may be found [here](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions/1484). Please consult
it before creating an enhancement request.

## Getting Started

The installation instructions are on the [official website](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).

## Sponsors

&lt;/p&gt;

## FAQ

- Is this an alternative to Electron?

  Depends on your requirements. It&#039;s designed to make it easy for Go programmers to make lightweight desktop
  applications or add a frontend to their existing applications. Wails does offer native elements such as menus
  and dialogs, so it could be considered a lightweight electron alternative.

- Who is this project aimed at?

  Go programmers who want to bundle an HTML/JS/CSS frontend with their applications, without resorting to creating a
  server and opening a browser to view it.

- What&#039;s with the name?

  When I saw WebView, I thought &quot;What I really want is tooling around building a WebView app, a bit like Rails is to
  Ruby&quot;. So initially it was a play on words (Webview on Rails). It just so happened to also be a homophone of the
  English name for the [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) I am from. So it stuck.

## One-line Compilation

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED=0
go build -o xray.exe -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Reproducible Releases

Make sure that you are using the same Go version, and remember to set the git commit id (7 bytes):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;all=-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

If you are compiling a 32-bit MIPS/MIPSLE target, use this command instead:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

----

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who&#039;s involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

----

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

## To start developing K8s

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```

For the full story, head over to the [developer&#039;s documentation].

## Support

If you need support, start with the [troubleshooting guide],
and work your way through the process that we&#039;ve outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us
[one way or another][communication].

## Community Meetings 

The [Calendar](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) has the list of all the meetings in the Kubernetes community in a single location.

## Adopters

The [User Case Studies](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/) website has real-world use cases of organizations across industries that are deploying/migrating to Kubernetes.

## Governance 

Kubernetes project is governed by a framework of principles, values, policies and processes to help our community and constituents towards our shared goals.

The [Kubernetes Community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) is the launching point for learning about how we organize ourselves.

The [Kubernetes Steering community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering) is used by the Kubernetes Steering Committee, which oversees governance of the Kubernetes project.

## Roadmap 

The [Kubernetes Enhancements repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) provides information about Kubernetes releases, as well as feature tracking and backlogs.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

- Find and use [popular software packaged as Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) to run in Kubernetes
- Share your own applications as Helm Charts
- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
- Manage releases of Helm packages

## Helm in a Handbasket

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Helm Development and Stable Versions

Helm v4 is currently under development on the `main` branch. This is unstable and the APIs within the Go SDK and at the command line are changing.
Helm v3 (current stable) is maintained on the `dev-v3` branch. APIs there follow semantic versioning.

## Install

Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest).

Unpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!

If you want to use a package manager:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install helm`.
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) users can use `choco install kubernetes-helm`.
- [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) users can use `winget install Helm.Helm`.
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) users can use `scoop install helm`.
- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) users can use `snap install helm --classic`.
- [Flox](https://flox.dev) users can use `flox install kubernetes-helm`.

To rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the [Quick Start Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/).

See the [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more options,
including installing pre-releases.

## Docs

Get started with the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://helm.sh/docs).

## Roadmap

The [Helm roadmap uses GitHub milestones](https://github.com/helm/helm/milestones) to track the progress of the project.

The development of Helm v4 is currently happening on the `main` branch while the development of Helm v3, the stable branch, is happening on the `dev-v3` branch. Changes should be made to the `main` branch prior to being added to the `dev-v3` branch so that all changes are carried along to Helm v4.

**Talos** is a modern OS for running Kubernetes: secure, immutable, and minimal.
Talos is fully open source, production-ready, and supported by the people at [Sidero Labs](https://www.SideroLabs.com/)
All system management is done via an API - there is no shell or interactive console.
Benefits include:

- **Security**: Talos reduces your attack surface: It&#039;s minimal, hardened, and immutable.
  All API access is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
- **Predictability**: Talos eliminates configuration drift, reduces unknown factors by employing immutable infrastructure ideology, and delivers atomic updates.
- **Evolvability**: Talos simplifies your architecture, increases your agility, and always delivers current stable Kubernetes and Linux versions.

## Installation

If you are migrating from another AUR helper, you can simply install Yay with that helper.

&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; We are using `sudo` in these examples, you can switch that out for a different privilege escalation tool.

### Source

The initial installation of Yay can be done by cloning the PKGBUILD and
building with makepkg:

We make sure we have the `base-devel` package group installed.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel &amp;&amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git &amp;&amp; cd yay &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
```

### Binary

If you do not want to compile yay yourself you can use the builds generated by
GitHub Actions.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel &amp;&amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git &amp;&amp; cd yay-bin &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
```

### Other distributions

If you&#039;re using Manjaro or [another distribution that packages `yay`](https://repology.org/project/yay/versions)
you can simply install yay using pacman (as root):

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel yay
```
&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; distributions sometimes lag updating yay on their repositories.

## First Use

#### Development packages upgrade

- Use `yay -Y --gendb` to generate a development package database for `*-git`
  packages that were installed without yay.
  This command should only be run once.

- `yay -Syu --devel` will then check for development package updates

- Use `yay -Y --devel --save` to make development package updates permanently
  enabled (`yay` and `yay -Syu` will then always check dev packages)

## Examples of Custom Operations

| Command                           | Description                                                                                                |

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Yay does not display colored output. How do I fix it?**

  Make sure you have the `Color` option in your `/etc/pacman.conf`
  (see issue [#123](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/123)).

- **Sometimes diffs are printed to the terminal, and other times they are paged via less. How do I fix this?**

  Yay uses `git diff` to display diffs, which by default tells less not to
  page if the output can fit into one terminal length. This behavior can be
  overridden by exporting your own flags (`export LESS=SRX`).

- **Yay is not asking me to edit PKGBUILDS, and I don&#039;t like the diff menu! What can I do?**

  `yay --editmenu --diffmenu=false --save`

- **How can I tell Yay to act only on AUR packages, or only on repo packages?**

  `yay -{OPERATION} --aur`
  `yay -{OPERATION} --repo`

- **A `Flagged Out Of Date AUR Packages` message is displayed. Why doesn&#039;t Yay update them?**

  This message does not mean that updated AUR packages are available. It means
  the packages have been flagged out of date on the AUR, but
  their maintainers have not yet updated the `PKGBUILD`s
  (see [outdated AUR packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Foo_in_the_AUR_is_outdated.3B_what_should_I_do.3F)).

- **Yay doesn&#039;t install dependencies added to a PKGBUILD during installation.**

  Yay resolves all dependencies ahead of time. You are free to edit the
  PKGBUILD in any way, but any problems you cause are your own and should not be
  reported unless they can be reproduced with the original PKGBUILD.

- **I know my `-git` package has updates but yay doesn&#039;t offer to update it**

  Yay uses a hash cache for development packages. Normally it is updated at the end of the package install with the message `Found git repo`.
  If you transition between aur helpers and did not install the devel package using yay at some point, it is possible it never got added to the cache. `yay -Y --gendb` will fix the current version of every devel package and start checking from there.

- **I want to help out!**

  Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Support

All support related to Yay should be requested via GitHub issues. Since Yay is not
officially supported by Arch Linux, support should not be sought out on the
forums, AUR comments or other official channels.

A broken AUR package should be reported as a comment on the package&#039;s AUR page.
A package may only be considered broken if it fails to build with makepkg.

Reports should be made using makepkg and include the full output as well as any
other relevant information. Never make reports using Yay or any other external
tools.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Incus

Incus is a modern, secure and powerful system container and virtual machine manager.

&lt;!-- Include start Incus intro --&gt;

It provides a unified experience for running and managing full Linux systems inside containers or virtual machines. Incus supports images for a large number of Linux distributions (official Ubuntu images and images provided by the community) and is built around a very powerful, yet pretty simple, REST API. Incus scales from one instance on a single machine to a cluster in a full data center rack, making it suitable for running workloads both for development and in production.

Incus allows you to easily set up a system that feels like a small private cloud. You can run any type of workload in an efficient way while keeping your resources optimized.

You should consider using Incus if you want to containerize different environments or run virtual machines, or in general run and manage your infrastructure in a cost-effective way.

You can try Incus online at: [`https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/`](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/)

&lt;!-- Include end Incus intro --&gt;

## Project history
Incus, which is named after the [Cumulonimbus incus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_incus) or anvil cloud
started as a community fork of Canonical&#039;s LXD following [Canonical&#039;s takeover](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) of the LXD project from the
Linux Containers community.

The project was then adopted by the Linux Containers community, taking back the spot left empty by LXD&#039;s departure.

Incus is a true open source community project, free of any [CLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) and
remains released under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
It&#039;s maintained by the same team of developers that first created LXD.

LXD users wishing to migrate to Incus can easily do so through a migration tool called [`lxd-to-incus`](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/server_migrate_lxd/).

## Security

&lt;!-- Include start security --&gt;

Consider the following aspects to ensure that your Incus installation is secure:

- Keep your operating system up-to-date and install all available security patches.
- Use only supported Incus versions.
- Restrict access to the Incus daemon and the remote API.
- Do not use privileged containers unless required. If you use privileged containers, put appropriate security measures in place. See the [LXC security page](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/) for more information.
- Configure your network interfaces to be secure.
&lt;!-- Include end security --&gt;

See [Security](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/main/doc/explanation/security.md) for detailed information.

**IMPORTANT:**
&lt;!-- Include start security note --&gt;
Local access to Incus through the Unix socket always grants full access to Incus.
This includes the ability to attach file system paths or devices to any instance as well as tweak the security features on any instance.

Therefore, you should only give such access to users who you&#039;d trust with root access to your system.
&lt;!-- Include end security note --&gt;
&lt;!-- Include start support --&gt;

# Introduction

restic is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure. It supports the three major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and a few smaller ones (FreeBSD, OpenBSD).

For detailed usage and installation instructions check out the [documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

You can ask questions in our [Discourse forum](https://forum.restic.net).

## Quick start

Once you&#039;ve [installed](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html) restic, start
off with creating a repository for your backups:

    $ restic init --repo /tmp/backup
    enter password for new backend:
    enter password again:
    created restic backend 085b3c76b9 at /tmp/backup
    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access the repository.
    Losing your password means that your data is irrecoverably lost.

and add some data:

    $ restic --repo /tmp/backup backup ~/work
    enter password for repository:
    scan [/home/user/work]
    scanned 764 directories, 1816 files in 0:00
    [0:29] 100.00%  54.732 MiB/s  1.582 GiB / 1.582 GiB  2580 / 2580 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
    duration: 0:29, 54.47MiB/s
    snapshot 40dc1520 saved

Next you can either use `restic restore` to restore files or use `restic
mount` to mount the repository via fuse and browse the files from previous
snapshots.

For more options check out the [online documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Backends

Saving a backup on the same machine is nice but not a real backup strategy.
Therefore, restic supports the following backends for storing backups natively:

- [Local directory](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#local)
- [sftp server (via SSH)](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#sftp)
- [HTTP REST server](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server) ([protocol](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#rest-backend), [rest-server](https://github.com/restic/rest-server))
- [Amazon S3](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#amazon-s3) (either from Amazon or using the [Minio](https://minio.io) server)
- [OpenStack Swift](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#openstack-swift)
- [BackBlaze B2](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#backblaze-b2)
- [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#microsoft-azure-blob-storage)
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#google-cloud-storage)
- And many other services via the [rclone](https://rclone.org) [Backend](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#other-services-via-rclone)

# Design Principles

Restic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the
following principles in mind:

-  **Easy**: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise
   you might be tempted to skip it. Restic should be easy to configure
   and use, so that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore
   it. Likewise, restoring data should not be complicated.

-  **Fast**: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by
   your network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files
   every day. Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring
   backups should only transfer data that is needed for the files that
   are to be restored, so that this process is also fast.

-  **Verifiable**: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic
   enables you to easily verify that all data can be restored.

-  **Secure**: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and
   integrity of your data. The location the backup data is stored is
   assumed not to be a trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where
   others like system administrators are able to access your backups).
   Restic is built to secure your data against such attackers.

-  **Efficient**: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should
   only take the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate
   data should be de-duplicated before it is actually written to the
   storage back end to save precious backup space.

# Reproducible Builds

The binaries released with each restic version starting at 0.6.1 are
[reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can
reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that
release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the
[builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.

## Getting Started &amp; Documentation

Documentation is available on the [Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform):

You can set up Teleport as a [Linux daemon](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo) or a [Kubernetes deployment](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/).

Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:

- No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
- Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
- Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.

Teleport uses [Go crypto](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto). It is _fully compatible with OpenSSH_, `sshd` servers, and `ssh` clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.

## Docker

### Deploy Teleport

If you wish to deploy Teleport inside a Docker container see the
[installation guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/#running-teleport-on-docker).

### For Local Testing and Development

To run a full test suite locally, see [the test dependencies list](BUILD_macos.md#local-tests-dependencies)

## Building Teleport

The `teleport` repository contains the Teleport daemon binary (written in Go)
and a web UI written in TypeScript.

If your intention is to build and deploy for use in a production infrastructure
a released tag should be used.  The default branch, `master`, is the current
development branch for an upcoming major version.  Get the latest release tags
listed at https://goteleport.com/download/ and then use that tag in the `git clone`.
For example `git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git -b v16.0.0` gets release v16.0.0.

### Dockerized Build

It is often easiest to build with Docker, which ensures that all required
tooling is available for the build. To execute a dockerized build, ensure
that docker is installed and running, and execute:

```
make -C build.assets build-binaries
```

### Local Build

#### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to build Teleport from source. For
maximum compatibility, install the versions of these dependencies using the
versions listed in [`build.assets/versions.mk`](/build.assets/versions.mk):

1. [`Go`](https://golang.org/dl/)
1. [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. [`libfido2`](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2)
1. [`pkg-config`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)

For an example of Dev Environment setup on a Mac, see [these
instructions](/BUILD_macos.md).

#### Perform a build

&gt;**Important**
&gt;
&gt;* The Go compiler is somewhat sensitive to the amount of memory: you will need
   **at least** 1GB of virtual memory to compile Teleport. A 512MB instance
   without swap will **not** work.
&gt;* This will build the latest version of Teleport, **regardless** of whether it
   is stable. If you want to build the latest stable release, run `git checkout`
   and `git submodule update --recursive` to the corresponding tag (for example,
&gt;* run `git checkout v8.0.0`) **before** performing a build.

Get the source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git
cd teleport
```

To perform a build

```shell
make full
```

`tsh` dynamically links against libfido2 by default, to support development
environments, as long as the library itself can be found:

```shell
$ brew install libfido2 pkg-config  # Replace with your package manager of choice

$ make build/tsh
&gt; libfido2 found, setting FIDO2=dynamic
&gt; (...)
```

Release binaries are linked statically against libfido2. You may switch the
linking mode using the FIDO2 variable:

```shell
make build/tsh FIDO2=dynamic # dynamic linking
make build/tsh FIDO2=static  # static linking, for an easy setup use `make enter`
                             # or `build.assets/macos/build-fido2-macos.sh`.
make build/tsh FIDO2=off     # doesn&#039;t link libfido2 in any way
```

`tsh` builds with Touch ID support require access to an Apple Developer account.
If you are a Teleport maintainer, ask the team for access.

#### Build output and run locally

If the build succeeds, the installer will place the binaries in the `build` directory.

Before starting, create default data directories:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p -m0700 /var/lib/teleport
sudo chown $USER /var/lib/teleport
```

#### Running Teleport in a hot reload mode

To speed up your development process, you can run Teleport using
[`CompileDaemon`](https://github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon). This will build
and run the Teleport binary, and then rebuild and restart it whenever any Go
source files change.

1. Install CompileDaemon:

    ```shell
    go install github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon@latest
    ```

    Note that we use `go install` instead of the suggested `go get`, because we
    don&#039;t want CompileDaemon to become a dependency of the project.

1. Build and run the Teleport binary:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload
    ```

    By default, this runs a `teleport start` command. If you want to customize
    the command, for example by providing a custom config file location, you can
    use the `TELEPORT_ARGS` parameter:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload TELEPORT_ARGS=&#039;start --config=/path/to/config.yaml&#039;
    ```

Note that you still need to run [`make grpc`](api/proto/README.md) if you modify
any Protocol Buffers files to regenerate the generated Go sources; regenerating
these sources should in turn cause the CompileDaemon to rebuild and restart
Teleport.

### Web UI

The Teleport Web UI resides in the [web](web) directory.

#### Rebuilding Web UI for development

To rebuild the Teleport UI package, run the following command:

```bash
make docker-ui
```

Then you can replace Teleport Web UI files with the files from the newly-generated `/dist` folder.

To enable speedy iterations on the Web UI, you can run a [local web-dev server](web#web-ui).

You can also tell Teleport to load the Web UI assets from the source directory.
To enable this behavior, set the environment variable `DEBUG=1` and rebuild with the default target:

```bash
# Run Teleport as a single-node cluster in development mode:
DEBUG=1 ./build/teleport start -d
```

Keep the server running in this mode, and make your UI changes in `/dist` directory.
For instructions about how to update the Web UI, read [the `web` README](web#readme).

### Managing dependencies

All dependencies are managed using [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules). Here are the instructions for some common tasks:

#### Add a new dependency

Latest version:

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency
```

and update the source to use this dependency.


To get a specific version, use `go get github.com/new/dependency@version` instead.

#### Set dependency to a specific version

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency@version
```

#### Update dependency to the latest version

```bash
go get -u github.com/new/dependency
```

#### Update all dependencies

```bash
go get -u all
```

#### Debugging dependencies

Why is a specific package imported?

`go mod why $pkgname`

Why is a specific module imported?

`go mod why -m $modname`

Why is a specific version of a module imported?

`go mod graph | grep $modname`

## Why did We Build Teleport?

The Teleport creators used to work together at Rackspace. We noticed that most cloud computing users struggle with setting up and configuring infrastructure security because popular tools, while flexible, are complex to understand and expensive to maintain. Additionally, most organizations use multiple infrastructure form factors such as several cloud providers, multiple cloud accounts, servers in colocation, and even smart devices. Some of those devices run on untrusted networks, behind third-party firewalls. This only magnifies complexity and increases operational overhead.

We had a choice, either start a security consulting business or build a solution that&#039;s dead-easy to use and understand. A real-time representation of all of your servers in the same room as you, as if they were magically _teleported_. Thus, Teleport was born!

![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true &quot;Docker Compose Logo&quot;)

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.

&gt; **Note**: About Docker Swarm
&gt; Docker Swarm used to rely on the legacy compose file format but did not adopted the compose specification
&gt; so is missing some of the recent enhancements in the compose syntax. After 
&gt; [acquisition by Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/software/swarm/) swarm isn&#039;t maintained by Docker Inc, and
&gt; as such some Docker Compose features aren&#039;t accessible to swarm users.

# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app&#039;s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `compose.yaml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - &quot;5000:5000&quot;
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```

Contributing
------------

Want to help develop Docker Compose? Check out our
[contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you find an issue, please report it on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).

Legacy
-------------

The Python version of Compose is available under the `v1` [branch](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1).
