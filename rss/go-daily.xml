Trivy ([pronunciation][pronunciation]) is a comprehensive and versatile security scanner.
Trivy has *scanners* that look for security issues, and *targets* where it can find those issues.

Targets (what Trivy can scan):

- Container Image
- Filesystem
- Git Repository (remote)
- Virtual Machine Image
- Kubernetes

Scanners (what Trivy can find there):

- OS packages and software dependencies in use (SBOM)
- Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- IaC issues and misconfigurations
- Sensitive information and secrets
- Software licenses

Trivy supports most popular programming languages, operating systems, and platforms. For a complete list, see the [Scanning Coverage] page.

# What is Rook?

Rook is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator** for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for Ceph storage to natively integrate with Kubernetes.

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is a distributed storage system that provides file, block and object storage and is deployed in large scale production clusters.

Rook automates deployment and management of Ceph to provide self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services.
The Rook operator does this by building on Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph.

The status of the Ceph storage provider is **Stable**. Features and improvements will be planned for many future versions. Upgrades between versions are provided to ensure backward compatibility between releases.

Rook is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a [graduated](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/) level project. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who&#039;s involved and how Rook plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/01/29/cncf-host-rook-project-cloud-native-storage-capabilities).

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

In addition, Gitleaks can be implemented as a pre-commit hook directly in your repo or as a GitHub action using [Gitleaks-Action](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action).

### Installing

```bash
# MacOS
brew install gitleaks

# Docker (DockerHub)
docker pull zricethezav/gitleaks:latest
docker run -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [SOURCE_PATH]

# Docker (ghcr.io)

# From Source (make sure `go` is installed)
git clone https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks.git
cd gitleaks
make build
```

### GitHub Action

Check out the official [Gitleaks GitHub Action](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action)

```
name: gitleaks
on: [pull_request, push, workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  scan:
    name: gitleaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITLEAKS_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.GITLEAKS_LICENSE}} # Only required for Organizations, not personal accounts.
```

### Pre-Commit

1. Install pre-commit from https://pre-commit.com/#install
2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of your repository with the following content:

   ```
   repos:
     - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
       rev: v8.24.2
       hooks:
         - id: gitleaks
   ```

   for a [native execution of GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases) or use the [`gitleaks-docker` pre-commit ID](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml) for executing GitLeaks using the [official Docker images](#docker)

3. Auto-update the config to the latest repos&#039; versions by executing `pre-commit autoupdate`
4. Install with `pre-commit install`
5. Now you&#039;re all set!

```
➜ git commit -m &quot;this commit contains a secret&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets.................................................Failed
```

Note: to disable the gitleaks pre-commit hook you can prepend `SKIP=gitleaks` to the commit command
and it will skip running gitleaks

```
➜ SKIP=gitleaks git commit -m &quot;skip gitleaks check&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets................................................Skipped
```

### Commands

⚠️ v8.19.0 introduced a change that deprecated `detect` and `protect`. Those commands are still available but
are hidden in the `--help` menu. Take a look at this [gist](https://gist.github.com/zricethezav/b325bb93ebf41b9c0b0507acf12810d2) for easy command translations.
If you find v8.19.0 broke an existing command (`detect`/`protect`), please open an issue.

There are three scanning modes: `git`, `dir`, and `stdin`.

#### Git
The `git` command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, gitleaks uses the `git log -p` command to scan patches.
You can configure the behavior of `git log -p` with the `log-opts` option.
For example, if you wanted to run gitleaks on a range of commits you could use the following
command: `gitleaks git -v --log-opts=&quot;--all commitA..commitB&quot; path_to_repo`. See the [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) documentation for more information.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.

#### Dir
The `dir` (aliases include `files`, `directory`) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: `gitleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file`.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will scan the current working directory.

#### Stdin
You can also stream data to gitleaks with the `stdin` command. Example: `cat some_file | gitleaks -v stdin`

### Creating a baseline

When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline,
gitleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any gitleaks report. To create a gitleaks report, run gitleaks with the `--report-path` parameter.

```
gitleaks git --report-path gitleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called gitleaks-report.json
```

Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:

```
gitleaks git --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json
```

After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.

## Pre-Commit hook

You can run Gitleaks as a pre-commit hook by copying the example `pre-commit.py` script into
your `.git/hooks/` directory.

## Load Configuration

The order of precedence is:

1. `--config/-c` option:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git --config /home/dev/customgitleaks.toml .
      ```
2. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` with the file path:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG=&quot;/home/dev/customgitleaks.toml&quot;
      gitleaks git .
      ```
3. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` with the file content:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML=`cat customgitleaks.toml`
      gitleaks git .
      ```
4. A `.gitleaks.toml` file within the target path:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git .
      ```

If none of the four options are used, then gitleaks will use the default config.

## Configuration

Gitleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:

```toml
# Title for the gitleaks configuration file.
title = &quot;Custom Gitleaks configuration&quot;

# You have basically two options for your custom configuration:
#
# 1. define your own configuration, default rules do not apply
#
#    use e.g., the default configuration as starting point:
#    https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
#
# 2. extend a configuration, the rules are overwritten or extended
#
#    When you extend a configuration the extended rules take precedence over the
#    default rules. I.e., if there are duplicate rules in both the extended
#    configuration and the default configuration the extended rules or
#    attributes of them will override the default rules.
#    Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain
#    together multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are
#    appended and can contain duplicates.

# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the default gitleaks config built in to the binary
# the latest version is located at:
# https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can provide a path to a configuration to extend from.
# The path is relative to where gitleaks was invoked,
# not the location of the base config.

Refer to the default [gitleaks config](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml) for examples or follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to the default configuration. Additionally, you can check out [this gitleaks blog post](https://blog.gitleaks.io/stop-leaking-secrets-configuration-2-3-aeed293b1fbf) which covers advanced configuration setups.

### Additional Configuration

#### gitleaks:allow

If you are knowingly committing a test secret that gitleaks will catch you can add a `gitleaks:allow` comment to that line which will instruct gitleaks
to ignore that secret. Ex:

```
class CustomClass:
    discord_client_secret = &#039;8dyfuiRyq=vVc3RRr_edRk-fK__JItpZ&#039;  #gitleaks:allow

```

#### .gitleaksignore

You can ignore specific findings by creating a `.gitleaksignore` file at the root of your repo. In release v8.10.0 Gitleaks added a `Fingerprint` value to the Gitleaks report. Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret. Add this fingerprint to the `.gitleaksignore` file to ignore that specific secret. See Gitleaks&#039; [.gitleaksignore](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/.gitleaksignore) for an example. Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.

#### Decoding

Sometimes secrets are encoded in a way that can make them difficult to find
with just regex. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically find and decode
encoded text. The flag `--max-decode-depth` enables this feature (the default
value &quot;0&quot; means the feature is disabled by default).

Recursive decoding is supported since decoded text can also contain encoded
text.  The flag `--max-decode-depth` sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops
when there are no new segments of encoded text to decode, so setting a really
high max depth doesn&#039;t mean it will make that many passes. It will only make as
many as it needs to decode the text. Overall, decoding only minimally increases
scan times.

The findings for encoded text differ from normal findings in the following
ways:

- The location points the bounds of the encoded text
  - If the rule matches outside the encoded text, the bounds are adjusted to
    include that as well
- The match and secret contain the decoded value
- Two tags are added `decoded:&lt;encoding&gt;` and `decode-depth:&lt;depth&gt;`

Currently supported encodings:

- **percent** - Any printable ASCII percent encoded values
- **hex** - Any printable ASCII hex encoded values &gt;= 32 characters 
- **base64** - Any printable ASCII base64 encoded values &gt;= 16 characters 

#### Reporting

Gitleaks has built-in support for several report formats: [`json`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/json_simple.json), [`csv`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/csv_simple.csv?plain=1), [`junit`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/junit_simple.xml), and [`sarif`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/sarif_simple.sarif).

If none of these formats fit your need, you can create your own report format with a [Go `text/template` .tmpl file](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-templates-in-go#step-4-writing-a-template) and the `--report-template` flag. The template can use [extended functionality from the `Masterminds/sprig`

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.

Harbor is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of cloud native technologies, consider joining the CNCF. For details about whose involved and how Harbor plays a role, read the CNCF
[announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/).

## Features

* **Cloud native registry**: With support for both container images and [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts, Harbor serves as registry for cloud native environments like container runtimes and orchestration platforms.
* **Role based access control**: Users access different repositories through &#039;projects&#039; and a user can have different permission for images or Helm charts under a project.
* **Policy based replication**: Images and charts can be replicated (synchronized) between multiple registry instances based on policies with using filters (repository, tag and label). Harbor automatically retries a replication if it encounters any errors. This can be used to assist loadbalancing, achieve high availability, and facilitate multi-datacenter deployments in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Harbor scans images regularly for vulnerabilities and has policy checks to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed.
* **LDAP/AD support**: Harbor integrates with existing enterprise LDAP/AD for user authentication and management, and supports importing LDAP groups into Harbor that can then be given permissions to specific projects.
* **OIDC support**: Harbor leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) to verify the identity of users authenticated by an external authorization server or identity provider. Single sign-on can be enabled to log into the Harbor portal.
* **Image deletion &amp; garbage collection**: System admin can run garbage collection jobs so that images(dangling manifests and unreferenced blobs) can be deleted and their space can be freed up periodically.
* **Notary**: Support signing container images using Docker Content Trust (leveraging Notary) for guaranteeing authenticity and provenance.  In addition, policies that prevent unsigned images from being deployed can also be activated.
* **Graphical user portal**: User can easily browse, search repositories and manage projects.
* **Auditing**: All the operations to the repositories are tracked through logs.
* **RESTful API**: RESTful APIs are provided to facilitate administrative operations, and are easy to use for integration with external systems. An embedded Swagger UI is available for exploring and testing the API.
* **Easy deployment**: Harbor can be deployed via Docker compose as well Helm Chart, and a Harbor Operator was added recently as well.

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

etcd is used [in production by many companies](./ADOPTERS.md), and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as [Kubernetes][k8s], [locksmith][], [vulcand][], [Doorman][], and many others. Reliability is further ensured by rigorous [**robustness testing**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness).

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.

## Maintainers

[Maintainers](OWNERS) strive to shape an inclusive open source project culture where users are heard and contributors feel respected and empowered. Maintainers aim to build productive relationships across different companies and disciplines. Read more about [Maintainers role and responsibilities](Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md#maintainers).

## Getting started

### Getting etcd

The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker on the [release page][github-release].

For more installation guides, please check out [play.etcd.io](http://play.etcd.io) and [operating etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide).

[github-release]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases

### Running etcd

First start a single-member cluster of etcd.

If etcd is installed using the [pre-built release binaries][github-release], run it from the installation location as below:

```bash
/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd
```

The etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:

```bash
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/
etcd
```

This will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.

Next, let&#039;s set a single key, and then retrieve it:

```bash
etcdctl put mykey &quot;this is awesome&quot;
etcdctl get mykey
```

etcd is now running and serving client requests. For more, please check out:

* [Interactive etcd playground](http://play.etcd.io)
* [Animated quick demo](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/demo)

### etcd TCP ports

The [official etcd ports][iana-ports] are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.

[iana-ports]: http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

### Running a local etcd cluster

First install [goreman](https://github.com/mattn/goreman), which manages Procfile-based applications.

Our [Procfile script](./Procfile) will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:

```bash
goreman start
```

This will bring up 3 etcd members `infra1`, `infra2` and `infra3` and optionally etcd `grpc-proxy`, which runs locally and composes a cluster.

Every cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.

Follow the comments in [Procfile script](./Procfile) to add a learner node to the cluster.

### Install etcd client v3

```bash
go get go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3
```

### Next steps

Now it&#039;s time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.

* Read the full [documentation].
* Review etcd [frequently asked questions].
* Explore the full gRPC [API].
* Set up a [multi-machine cluster][clustering].
* Learn the [config format, env variables and flags][configuration].
* Find [language bindings and tools][integrations].
* Use TLS to [secure an etcd cluster][security].
* [Tune etcd][tuning].

## Quickstart (GKE)

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the latest major version.

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 --branch v0 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
   cd microservices-demo/
   ```

   The `--depth 1` argument skips downloading git history.

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.

4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

5. Deploy Online Boutique to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```

6. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

![Moby Project logo](docs/static_files/moby-project-logo.png &quot;The Moby Project&quot;)

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.

It provides a &quot;Lego set&quot; of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.

## Principles

Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set its direction.

- Modular: the project includes lots of components that have well-defined functions and APIs that work together.
- Batteries included but swappable: Moby includes enough components to build fully featured container systems, but its modular architecture ensures that most of the components can be swapped by different implementations.
- Usable security: Moby provides secure defaults without compromising usability.
- Developer focused: The APIs are intended to be functional and useful to build powerful tools.
They are not necessarily intended as end user tools but as components aimed at developers.
Documentation and UX is aimed at developers not end users.

## Audience

The Moby Project is intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent and build systems based on containers.
It is not for people looking for a commercially supported system, but for people who want to work and learn with open source code.

## Relationship with Docker

The components and tools in the Moby Project are initially the open source components that Docker and the community have built for the Docker Project.
New projects can be added if they fit with the community goals. Docker is committed to using Moby as the upstream for the Docker Product.
However, other projects are also encouraged to use Moby as an upstream, and to reuse the components in diverse ways, and all these uses will be treated in the same way. External maintainers and contributors are welcomed.

The Moby project is not intended as a location for support or feature requests for Docker products, but as a place for contributors to work on open source code, fix bugs, and make the code more useful.
The releases are supported by the maintainers, community and users, on a best efforts basis only. For customers who want enterprise or commercial support, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/) are the appropriate products for these use cases.

# Excelize

## Introduction

Excelize is a library written in pure Go providing a set of functions that allow you to write to and read from XLAM / XLSM / XLSX / XLTM / XLTX files. Supports reading and writing spreadsheet documents generated by Microsoft Excel&amp;trade; 2007 and later. Supports complex components by high compatibility, and provided streaming API for generating or reading data from a worksheet with huge amounts of data. This library needs Go version 1.23 or later. The full docs can be seen using go&#039;s built-in documentation tool, or online at [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xuri/excelize/v2) and [docs reference](https://xuri.me/excelize/).

## Basic Usage

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/xuri/excelize
```

- If your packages are managed using [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules), please install with following command.

```bash
go get github.com/xuri/excelize/v2
```

### Create spreadsheet

Here is a minimal example usage that will create spreadsheet file.

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;

    &quot;github.com/xuri/excelize/v2&quot;
)

func main() {
    f := excelize.NewFile()
    defer func() {
        if err := f.Close(); err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }
    }()
    // Create a new sheet.
    index, err := f.NewSheet(&quot;Sheet2&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    // Set value of a cell.
    f.SetCellValue(&quot;Sheet2&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;, &quot;Hello world.&quot;)
    f.SetCellValue(&quot;Sheet1&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;, 100)
    // Set active sheet of the workbook.
    f.SetActiveSheet(index)
    // Save spreadsheet by the given path.
    if err := f.SaveAs(&quot;Book1.xlsx&quot;); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}
```

### Reading spreadsheet

The following constitutes the bare to read a spreadsheet document.

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;

    &quot;github.com/xuri/excelize/v2&quot;
)

func main() {
    f, err := excelize.OpenFile(&quot;Book1.xlsx&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    defer func() {
        // Close the spreadsheet.
        if err := f.Close(); err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }
    }()
    // Get value from cell by given worksheet name and cell reference.
    cell, err := f.GetCellValue(&quot;Sheet1&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println(cell)
    // Get all the rows in the Sheet1.
    rows, err := f.GetRows(&quot;Sheet1&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    for _, row := range rows {
        for _, colCell := range row {
            fmt.Print(colCell, &quot;\t&quot;)
        }
        fmt.Println()
    }
}
```

### Add chart to spreadsheet file

With Excelize chart generation and management is as easy as a few lines of code. You can build charts based on data in your worksheet or generate charts without any data in your worksheet at all.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;650&quot; src=&quot;./test/images/chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;Excelize&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

```go

    &quot;fmt&quot;

    &quot;github.com/xuri/excelize/v2&quot;
)

func main() {
    f := excelize.NewFile()
    defer func() {
        if err := f.Close(); err != nil {

        }
    }()
    for idx, row := range [][]interface{}{
        {nil, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Pear&quot;}, {&quot;Small&quot;, 2, 3, 3},
        {&quot;Normal&quot;, 5, 2, 4}, {&quot;Large&quot;, 6, 7, 8},
    } {
        cell, err := excelize.CoordinatesToCellName(1, idx+1)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
            return
        }
        f.SetSheetRow(&quot;Sheet1&quot;, cell, &amp;row)

    // Insert a picture.
    if err := f.AddPicture(&quot;Sheet1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;, &quot;image.png&quot;, nil); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    // Insert a picture to worksheet with scaling.
    if err := f.AddPicture(&quot;Sheet1&quot;, &quot;D2&quot;, &quot;image.jpg&quot;,
        &amp;excelize.GraphicOptions{ScaleX: 0.5, ScaleY: 0.5}); err != nil {

Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields based on tags.

It has the following **unique** features:

-   Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or custom validators.
-   Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a multidimensional field to be validated.
-   Ability to dive into both map keys and values for validation
-   Handles type interface by determining it&#039;s underlying type prior to validation.
-   Handles custom field types such as sql driver Valuer see [Valuer](https://golang.org/src/database/sql/driver/types.go?s=1210:1293#L29)
-   Alias validation tags, which allows for mapping of several validations to a single tag for easier defining of validations on structs
-   Extraction of custom defined Field Name e.g. can specify to extract the JSON name while validating and have it available in the resulting FieldError
-   Customizable i18n aware error messages.
-   Default validator for the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework; upgrading from v8 to v9 in gin see [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/master/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding)

A Call for Maintainers
----------------------

Please read the discussiong started [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/discussions/1330) if you are interested in contributing/helping maintain this package.

Installation
------------

Use go get.

	go get github.com/go-playground/validator/v10

Then import the validator package into your own code.

	import &quot;github.com/go-playground/validator/v10&quot;

Error Return Value
-------

Validation functions return type error

They return type error to avoid the issue discussed in the following, where err is always != nil:

* http://stackoverflow.com/a/29138676/3158232
* https://github.com/go-playground/validator/issues/134

Validator returns only InvalidValidationError for bad validation input, nil or ValidationErrors as type error; so, in your code all you need to do is check if the error returned is not nil, and if it&#039;s not check if error is InvalidValidationError ( if necessary, most of the time it isn&#039;t ) type cast it to type ValidationErrors like so:

```go
err := validate.Struct(mystruct)
validationErrors := err.(validator.ValidationErrors)
 ```

Usage and documentation
------

Please see https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 for detailed usage docs.

Baked-in Validations
------

### Special Notes:
- If new to using validator it is highly recommended to initialize it using the `WithRequiredStructEnabled` option which is opt-in to new behaviour that will become the default behaviour in v11+. See documentation for more details.
```go
validate := validator.New(validator.WithRequiredStructEnabled())
```

Fx is a dependency injection system for Go.

**Benefits**

- Eliminate globals: Fx helps you remove global state from your application.
  No more `init()` or global variables. Use Fx-managed singletons.
- Code reuse: Fx lets teams within your organization build loosely-coupled
  and well-integrated shareable components.
- Battle tested: Fx is the backbone of nearly all Go services at Uber.

See our [docs](https://uber-go.github.io/fx/) to get started and/or
learn more about Fx.

## Installation

Use Go modules to install Fx in your application.

```shell
go get go.uber.org/fx@v1
```

## Getting started

To get started with Fx, [start here](https://uber-go.github.io/fx/get-started/).

## Stability

This library is `v1` and follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) strictly.

No breaking changes will be made to exported APIs before `v2.0.0`.

This project follows the [Go Release Policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy). Each major
version of Go is supported until there are two newer major releases.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/stretchr/testify)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/stretchr/testify) [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/stretchr/testify)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify)

Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.

Features include:

  * [Easy assertions](#assert-package)
  * [Mocking](#mock-package)
  * [Testing suite interfaces and functions](#suite-package)

Get started:

  * Install testify with [one line of code](#installation), or [update it with another](#staying-up-to-date)
  * For an introduction to writing test code in Go, see https://go.dev/doc/code#Testing
  * Check out the API Documentation https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify
  * Use [testifylint](https://github.com/Antonboom/testifylint) (via [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)) to avoid common mistakes
  * A little about [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

[`assert`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `assert` package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

  * Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
  * Allows for very readable code
  * Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

See it in action:

```go
package yours

import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	// assert equality
	assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, &quot;they should be equal&quot;)

	// assert inequality
	assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, &quot;they should not be equal&quot;)

	// assert for nil (good for errors)
	assert.Nil(t, object)

	// assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
	if assert.NotNil(t, object) {
		// now we know that object isn&#039;t nil, we are safe to make
		// further assertions without causing any errors
		assert.Equal(t, &quot;Something&quot;, object.Value)
	}
}
```

  * Every assert func takes the `testing.T` object as the first argument.  This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.
  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	assert := assert.New(t)

	// assert equality
	assert.Equal(123, 123, &quot;they should be equal&quot;)

	// assert inequality
	assert.NotEqual(123, 456, &quot;they should not be equal&quot;)

	// assert for nil (good for errors)
	assert.Nil(object)

	// assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
	if assert.NotNil(object) {
		// now we know that object isn&#039;t nil, we are safe to make
		// further assertions without causing any errors
		assert.Equal(&quot;Something&quot;, object.Value)
	}
}
```

[`require`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/require &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.
These functions must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function, not from other goroutines created during the test.
Otherwise race conditions may occur.

See [t.FailNow](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.FailNow) for details.

[`mock`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.

An example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can set up expectations (testify) and assert that they indeed happened:

```go
package yours

import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/mock&quot;
)

/*
  Test objects
*/

// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface
// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.
type MyMockedObject struct {
	mock.Mock
}

// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface
// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.
//
// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this
// is a mocked object - we&#039;re just going to stub it out.
//
// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.
func (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {
	args := m.Called(number)
	return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)
}

/*
  Actual test functions
*/

// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	// create an instance of our test object
	testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

	// set up expectations
	testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, 123).Return(true, nil)

	// call the code we are testing
	targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

	// assert that the expectations were met
	testObj.AssertExpectations(t)
}

// TestSomethingWithPlaceholder is a second example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
// This time using a placeholder. Placeholders might be used when the
// data being passed in is normally dynamically generated and cannot be
// predicted beforehand (eg. containing hashes that are time sensitive)
func TestSomethingWithPlaceholder(t *testing.T) {
	// create an instance of our test object
	testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

	// set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list
	testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)

	// call the code we are testing
	targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

	// assert that the expectations were met
	testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

}

// TestSomethingElse2 is a third example that shows how you can use
// the Unset method to cleanup handlers and then add new ones.
func TestSomethingElse2(t *testing.T) {
	// create an instance of our test object
	testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

	// set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list
	mockCall := testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)

	// call the code we are testing
	targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

	// assert that the expectations were met
	testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

	// remove the handler now so we can add another one that takes precedence
	mockCall.Unset()

	// return false now instead of true
	testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(false, nil)

	testObj.AssertExpectations(t)
}
```

For more information on how to write mock code, check out the [API documentation for the `mock` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock).

You can use the [mockery tool](https://vektra.github.io/mockery/latest/) to autogenerate the mock code against an interface as well, making using mocks much quicker.

[`suite`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The suite package does not support parallel tests. See [#934](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/issues/934).

The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object-oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with &#039;go test&#039; as per normal.

An example suite is shown below:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/suite&quot;
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including a T() method which
// returns the current testing context
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
	suite.Suite
	VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
	suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with &quot;Test&quot; are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
	assert.Equal(suite.T(), 5, suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive)
}

// In order for &#039;go test&#039; to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
	suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

For more information on writing suites, check out the [API documentation for the `suite` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite).

`Suite` object has assertion methods:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/suite&quot;
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including assertion methods.
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
	suite.Suite
	VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
	suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with &quot;Test&quot; are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
	suite.Equal(suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
}

// In order for &#039;go test&#039; to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
	suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

## Introduction

Syft is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for container images and filesystems. It provides detailed visibility into the packages and dependencies in your software, helping you manage vulnerabilities, license compliance, and software supply chain security.

Syft development is sponsored by [Anchore](https://anchore.com/), and is released under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file). For commercial support options with Syft or Grype, please [contact Anchore](https://get.anchore.com/contact/).

## Features
- Generates SBOMs for container images, filesystems, archives, and more to discover packages and libraries
- Supports OCI, Docker and [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) image formats
- Linux distribution identification
- Works seamlessly with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) (a fast, modern vulnerability scanner)
- Able to create signed SBOM attestations using the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md)
- Convert between SBOM formats, such as CycloneDX, SPDX, and Syft&#039;s own format.

## Installation

Syft binaries are provided for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Recommended
&gt; ```bash 
&gt; curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
&gt; ```

Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Homebrew
```bash
brew install syft
```

### Scoop

```powershell
scoop install syft
```

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of Syft is community-maintained and not distributed by the Anchore team

```powershell
choco install syft -y
```

### Nix

**Note**: Nix packaging of Syft is [community maintained](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/sy/syft/package.nix). Syft is available in the [stable channel](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_channels#The_official_channels) since NixOS `22.05`.

```bash
nix-env -i syft
```

... or, just try it out in an ephemeral nix shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p syft
```

## Getting started

### SBOM

To generate an SBOM for a container image:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt;
```

The above output includes only software that is visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the SBOM, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

### Output formats

The output format for Syft is configurable as well using the `-o` (or `--output`) option:

```
syft &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the `formats` available are:
- `syft-json`: Use this to get as much information out of Syft as possible!
- `syft-text`: A row-oriented, human-and-machine-friendly output.
- `cyclonedx-xml`: A XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-xml@1.5`: A XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json@1.5`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `spdx-tag-value`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/).
- `spdx-tag-value@2.2`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.2.2/).
- `spdx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.3/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `spdx-json@2.2`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.2/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `github-json`: A JSON report conforming to GitHub&#039;s dependency snapshot format.
- `syft-table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](#using-templates) below.

Note that flags using the @&lt;version&gt; can be used for earlier versions of each specification as well.

### Datadog Client Libraries for Go

This repository contains Go packages for the client-side components of the Datadog product suite for Application Performance Monitoring, Continuous Profiling and Application Security Monitoring of Go applications.

- [Datadog Application Performance Monitoring (APM)](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/): Trace requests as they flow across web servers, databases, and microservices so that developers have great visibility into bottlenecks and troublesome requests.  
The package [`github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/ddtrace/tracer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/ddtrace/tracer) allows you to trace any piece of your Go code, and commonly used Go libraries can be automatically traced thanks to our out-of-the-box integrations which can be found in the package [`github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/contrib`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/contrib).
&lt;!-- # TODO: review contrib URL --&gt;

- [Datadog Go Continuous Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/profiler/): Continuously profile your Go apps to find CPU, memory, and synchronization bottlenecks, broken down by function name, and line number, to significantly reduce end-user latency and infrastructure costs.  
The package [`github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/profiler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/profiler) allows you to periodically collect and send Go profiles to the Datadog API.

- [Datadog Application Security Management (ASM)](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security_platform/application_security/) provides in-app monitoring and protection against application-level attacks that aim to exploit code-level vulnerabilities, such as a Server-Side-Request-Forgery (SSRF), a SQL injection (SQLi), or Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). ASM identifies services exposed to application attacks and leverages in-app security rules to detect and protect against threats in your application environment. ASM is not a standalone Go package and is transparently integrated into the APM tracer. You can simply enable it with [`DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true`](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/enabling/go).

### Installing

This module contains many packages, but most users should probably install the two packages below:

```bash
go get github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/ddtrace/tracer
go get github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/profiler
```

Additionally there are many [contrib](./contrib) packages, published as nested modules, that can be installed to automatically instrument and trace commonly used Go libraries such as [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/net/http/v2), [gorilla/mux](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/gorilla/mux/v2) or [database/sql/v2](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/database/sql/v2)

```
go get github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/gorilla/mux/v2
```

If you installed more packages than you intended, you can use `go mod tidy` to remove any unused packages.

### Documentation

 - [APM Tracing API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/ddtrace)
 - [APM Tracing Go Applications](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/go/)
 - [Continuous Go Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/profiler/enabling/go)
 - [Application Security Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security_platform/application_security/setup_and_configure/?code-lang=go)
 - If you are migrating from an older version of the tracer (e.g., 1.60.x) you may also find the [migration document](MIGRATING.md) we&#039;ve put together helpful.

### Go Support Policy

Datadog APM for Go is built upon dependencies defined in specific versions of the host operating system, Go releases, and the Datadog Agent/API. dd-trace-go supports the two latest releases of Go, matching the [official Go policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). This library only officially supports [first class ports](https://go.dev/wiki/PortingPolicy) of Go.

### Contributing

Before considering contributions to the project, please take a moment to read our brief [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Testing

Tests can be run locally using the Go toolset.

To run integration tests locally, you should set the `INTEGRATION` environment variable. The dependencies of the integration tests are best run via Docker. To get an idea about the versions and the set-up take a look at our [docker-compose config](./docker-compose.yaml).

The best way to run the entire test suite is using the [scripts/test.sh](./scripts/test.sh) script. You&#039;ll need Docker and docker-compose installed. If this is your first time running the tests, you should run `./scripts/test.sh -t` to install any missing test tools/dependencies. Run `./scripts/test.sh --all` to run all of the integration tests through the docker-compose environment. Run `./scripts/test.sh --help` for more options.

If you&#039;re only interested in the tests for a specific integration it can be useful to spin up just the required containers via docker-compose.
For example if you&#039;re running tests that need the `mysql` database container to be up:
```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p dd-trace-go up -d mysql
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Wire: Automated Initialization in Go

[![Build Status](https://github.com/google/wire/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/google/wire/actions)
[![godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/google/wire?status.svg)][godoc]
[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/google/wire/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/google/wire)


Wire is a code generation tool that automates connecting components using
[dependency injection][]. Dependencies between components are represented in
Wire as function parameters, encouraging explicit initialization instead of
global variables. Because Wire operates without runtime state or reflection,
code written to be used with Wire is useful even for hand-written
initialization.

For an overview, see the [introductory blog post][].

fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-preview.png&quot; width=640&gt;

It&#039;s an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command
history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. It implements
a &quot;fuzzy&quot; matching algorithm, so you can quickly type in patterns with omitted
characters and still get the results you want.

Installation
------------

### Using Homebrew

You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on macOS or Linux) to install fzf.

```sh
brew install fzf
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; To set up shell integration (key bindings and fuzzy completion),
&gt; see [the instructions below](#setting-up-shell-integration).

fzf is also available [via MacPorts][portfile]: `sudo port install fzf`

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/fzf.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/fzf/versions)

### Windows packages

On Windows, fzf is available via [Chocolatey][choco], [Scoop][scoop],
[Winget][winget], and [MSYS2][msys2]:

| Package manager | Command                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Chocolatey      | `choco install fzf`                   |
| Scoop           | `scoop install fzf`                   |
| Winget          | `winget install fzf`                  |
| MSYS2 (pacman)  | `pacman -S $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-fzf` |

[choco]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/fzf
[scoop]: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/master/bucket/fzf.json
[winget]: https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/j/junegunn/fzf
[msys2]: https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-fzf

### Using git

Alternatively, you can &quot;git clone&quot; this repository to any directory and run
[install](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/install) script.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
```

The install script will add lines to your shell configuration file to modify
`$PATH` and set up shell integration.

### Binary releases

You can download the official fzf binaries from the releases page.

* https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases

### Setting up shell integration

Add the following line to your shell configuration file.

* bash
  ```sh
  # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
  eval &quot;$(fzf --bash)&quot;
  ```
* zsh
  ```sh
  # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
  source &lt;(fzf --zsh)
  ```
* fish
  ```fish
  # Set up fzf key bindings
  fzf --fish | source
  ```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; `--bash`, `--zsh`, and `--fish` options are only available in fzf 0.48.0 or
&gt; later. If you have an older version of fzf, or want finer control, you can
&gt; source individual script files in the [/shell](/shell) directory. The
&gt; location of the files may vary depending on the package manager you use.
&gt; Please refer to the package documentation for more information.
&gt; (e.g. `apt show fzf`)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can disable CTRL-T or ALT-C binding by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` or
&gt; `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to an empty string when sourcing the script.
&gt; For example, to disable ALT-C binding:
&gt;
&gt; * bash: `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval &quot;$(fzf --bash)&quot;`
&gt; * zsh: `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source &lt;(fzf --zsh)`
&gt; * fish: `fzf --fish | FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source`
&gt;
&gt; Setting the variables after sourcing the script will have no effect.

### Vim/Neovim plugin

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this to
your Vim configuration file:

```vim
Plug &#039;junegunn/fzf&#039;, { &#039;do&#039;: { -&gt; fzf#install() } }
Plug &#039;junegunn/fzf.vim&#039;
```

* `junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions
    * `fzf#install()` makes sure that you have the latest binary
* `junegunn/fzf.vim` is [a separate project](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
  that provides a variety of useful commands

To learn more about the Vim integration, see [README-VIM.md](README-VIM.md).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out
&gt; [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua).

Upgrading fzf
-------------

fzf is being actively developed, and you might want to upgrade it once in a
while. Please follow the instruction below depending on the installation
method used.

- git: `cd ~/.fzf &amp;&amp; git pull &amp;&amp; ./install`
- brew: `brew update; brew upgrade fzf`
- macports: `sudo port upgrade fzf`
- chocolatey: `choco upgrade fzf`
- vim-plug: `:PlugUpdate fzf`

Building fzf
------------

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

Usage
-----

fzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the
selected item to STDOUT.

```sh
find * -type f | fzf &gt; selected
```

Without STDIN pipe, fzf will traverse the file system under the current
directory to get the list of files.

```sh
vim $(fzf)
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You can override the default behavior
&gt; * Either by setting `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to a command that generates the desired list
&gt; * Or by setting `--walker`, `--walker-root`, and `--walker-skip` options in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we&#039;ve presented
&gt; the above as it&#039;s easier to grasp
&gt; ```sh
&gt; fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim
&gt; ```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process.
&gt;
&gt; ```sh
&gt; fzf --bind &#039;enter:become(vim {})&#039;
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; *See [Turning into a different process](#turning-into-a-different-process)
&gt; for more information.*

### Using the finder

- `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down
- `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit
- On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items
- Emacs style key bindings
- Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on
  multi-select mode

### Display modes

fzf by default runs in fullscreen mode, but there are other display modes.

#### `--height` mode

With `--height HEIGHT[%]`, fzf will start below the cursor with the given height.

```sh
fzf --height 40%
```

`reverse` layout and `--border` goes well with this option.

```sh
fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border
```

By prepending `~` to the height, you&#039;re setting the maximum height.

```sh
# Will take as few lines as possible to display the list
seq 3 | fzf --height ~100%
seq 3000 | fzf --height ~100%
```

Height value can be a negative number.

```sh
# Screen height - 3
fzf --height -3
```

#### `--tmux` mode

With `--tmux` option, fzf will start in a tmux popup.

```sh
# --tmux [center|top|bottom|left|right][,SIZE[%]][,SIZE[%][,border-native]]

fzf --tmux center         # Center, 50% width and height
fzf --tmux 80%            # Center, 80% width and height
fzf --tmux 100%,50%       # Center, 100% width and 50% height
fzf --tmux left,40%       # Left, 40% width
fzf --tmux left,40%,90%   # Left, 40% width, 90% height
fzf --tmux top,40%        # Top, 40% height
fzf --tmux bottom,80%,40% # Bottom, 80% height, 40% height
```

`--tmux` is silently ignored when you&#039;re not on tmux.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re stuck with an old version of tmux that doesn&#039;t support popup,
&gt; or if you want to open fzf in a regular tmux pane, check out
&gt; [fzf-tmux](bin/fzf-tmux) script.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can add these options to `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` so that they&#039;re applied by
&gt; default. For example,
&gt;
&gt; ```sh
&gt; # Open in tmux popup if on tmux, otherwise use --height mode
&gt; export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&#039;--height 40% --tmux bottom,40% --layout reverse --border top&#039;
&gt; ```

### Search syntax

Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in &quot;extended-search mode&quot; where you can
type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. `^music .mp3$ sbtrkt
!fire`

| Token     | Match type                              | Description                                  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------  | ------------------------------------------   |
| `sbtrkt`  | fuzzy-match                             | Items that match `sbtrkt`                    |
| `&#039;wild`   | exact-match (quoted)                    | Items that include `wild`                    |
| `&#039;wild&#039;`  | exact-boundary-match (quoted both ends) | Items that include `wild` at word boundaries |
| `^music`  | prefix-exact-match                      | Items that start with `music`                |
| `.mp3$`   | suffix-exact-match                      | Items that end with `.mp3`                   |
| `!fire`   | inverse-exact-match                     | Items that do not include `fire`             |
| `!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match              | Items that do not start with `music`         |
| `!.mp3$`  | inverse-suffix-exact-match              | Items that do not end with `.mp3`            |

If you don&#039;t prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to &quot;quote&quot; every word,
start fzf with `-e` or `--exact` option. Note that when  `--exact` is set,
`&#039;`-prefix &quot;unquotes&quot; the term.

A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following
query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either `go`, `rb`,
or `py`.

```
^core go$ | rb$ | py$
```

### Environment variables

- `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`
    - Default command to use when input is tty
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=&#039;fd --type f&#039;`
- `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`
    - Default options
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&quot;--layout=reverse --inline-info&quot;`
- `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE`
    - If you prefer to manage default options in a file, set this variable to
      point to the location of the file
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE=~/.fzfrc`

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is not used by shell integration due to the
&gt; slight difference in requirements.
&gt;
&gt; * `CTRL-T` runs `$FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to get a list of files and directories
&gt; * `ALT-C` runs `$FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to get a list of directories
&gt; * `vim ~/**&lt;tab&gt;` runs `fzf_compgen_path()` with the prefix (`~/`) as the first argument
&gt; * `cd foo**&lt;tab&gt;` runs `fzf_compgen_dir()` with the prefix (`foo`) as the first argument
&gt;
&gt; The available options are described later in this document.

### Customizing the look

The user interface of fzf is fully customizable with a large number of
configuration options. For a quick setup, you can start with one of the style
presets — `default`, `full`, or `minimal` — using the `--style` option.

```sh
fzf --style full \
    --preview &#039;fzf-preview.sh {}&#039; --bind &#039;focus:transform-header:file --brief {}&#039;
```

| Preset    | Screenshot                                                                             |
| :---      | :---                                                                                   |
| `default` | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-default.png&quot;/&gt; |
| `full`    | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-full.png&quot;/&gt;    |
| `minimal` | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-minimal.png&quot;/&gt; |

Here&#039;s an example based on the `full` preset:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-4-borders.png&quot;/&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

```sh
git ls-files | fzf --style full \
    --border --padding 1,2 \
    --border-label &#039; Demo &#039; --input-label &#039; Input &#039; --header-label &#039; File Type &#039; \
    --preview &#039;fzf-preview.sh {}&#039; \
    --bind &#039;result:transform-list-label:
        if [[ -z $FZF_QUERY ]]; then
          echo &quot; $FZF_MATCH_COUNT items &quot;
        else
          echo &quot; $FZF_MATCH_COUNT matches for [$FZF_QUERY] &quot;
        fi
        &#039; \
    --bind &#039;focus:transform-preview-label:[[ -n {} ]] &amp;&amp; printf &quot; Previewing [%s] &quot; {}&#039; \
    --bind &#039;focus:+transform-header:file --brief {} || echo &quot;No file selected&quot;&#039; \
    --bind &#039;ctrl-r:change-list-label( Reloading the list )+reload(sleep 2; git ls-files)&#039; \
    --color &#039;border:#aaaaaa,label:#cccccc&#039; \
    --color &#039;preview-border:#9999cc,preview-label:#ccccff&#039; \
    --color &#039;list-border:#669966,list-label:#99cc99&#039; \
    --color &#039;input-border:#996666,input-label:#ffcccc&#039; \
    --color &#039;header-border:#6699cc,header-label:#99ccff&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

Key bindings for command-line
-----------------------------

By [setting up shell integration](#setting-up-shell-integration), you can use
the following key bindings in bash, zsh, and fish.

- `CTRL-T` - Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line
    - The list is generated using `--walker file,dir,follow,hidden` option

# pgx - PostgreSQL Driver and Toolkit

pgx is a pure Go driver and toolkit for PostgreSQL.

The pgx driver is a low-level, high performance interface that exposes PostgreSQL-specific features such as `LISTEN` /
`NOTIFY` and `COPY`. It also includes an adapter for the standard `database/sql` interface.

The toolkit component is a related set of packages that implement PostgreSQL functionality such as parsing the wire protocol
and type mapping between PostgreSQL and Go. These underlying packages can be used to implement alternative drivers,
proxies, load balancers, logical replication clients, etc.

## Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;

	&quot;github.com/jackc/pgx/v5&quot;
)

func main() {
	// urlExample := &quot;postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name&quot;
	conn, err := pgx.Connect(context.Background(), os.Getenv(&quot;DATABASE_URL&quot;))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Unable to connect to database: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer conn.Close(context.Background())

	var name string
	var weight int64
	err = conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), &quot;select name, weight from widgets where id=$1&quot;, 42).Scan(&amp;name, &amp;weight)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;QueryRow failed: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	fmt.Println(name, weight)
}
```

See the [getting started guide](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/wiki/Getting-started-with-pgx) for more information.

## Features

* Support for approximately 70 different PostgreSQL types
* Automatic statement preparation and caching
* Batch queries
* Single-round trip query mode
* Full TLS connection control
* Binary format support for custom types (allows for much quicker encoding/decoding)
* `COPY` protocol support for faster bulk data loads
* Tracing and logging support
* Connection pool with after-connect hook for arbitrary connection setup
* `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY`
* Conversion of PostgreSQL arrays to Go slice mappings for integers, floats, and strings
* `hstore` support
* `json` and `jsonb` support
* Maps `inet` and `cidr` PostgreSQL types to `netip.Addr` and `netip.Prefix`
* Large object support
* NULL mapping to pointer to pointer
* Supports `database/sql.Scanner` and `database/sql/driver.Valuer` interfaces for custom types
* Notice response handling
* Simulated nested transactions with savepoints

## Choosing Between the pgx and database/sql Interfaces

The pgx interface is faster. Many PostgreSQL specific features such as `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` and `COPY` are not available
through the `database/sql` interface.

The pgx interface is recommended when:

1. The application only targets PostgreSQL.
2. No other libraries that require `database/sql` are in use.

It is also possible to use the `database/sql` interface and convert a connection to the lower-level pgx interface as needed.

## Testing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup instructions.

## Architecture

See the presentation at Golang Estonia, [PGX Top to Bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXMSWhcHCf8) for a description of pgx architecture.

## Supported Go and PostgreSQL Versions

pgx supports the same versions of Go and PostgreSQL that are supported by their respective teams. For [Go](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy) that is the two most recent major releases and for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) the major releases in the last 5 years. This means pgx supports Go 1.23 and higher and PostgreSQL 13 and higher. pgx also is tested against the latest version of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/).

## Version Policy

pgx follows semantic versioning for the documented public API on stable releases. `v5` is the latest stable major version.

## PGX Family Libraries

### [github.com/jackc/pglogrepl](https://github.com/jackc/pglogrepl)

pglogrepl provides functionality to act as a client for PostgreSQL logical replication.

### [github.com/jackc/pgmock](https://github.com/jackc/pgmock)

pgmock offers the ability to create a server that mocks the PostgreSQL wire protocol. This is used internally to test pgx by purposely inducing unusual errors. pgproto3 and pgmock together provide most of the foundational tooling required to implement a PostgreSQL proxy or MitM (such as for a custom connection pooler).

### [github.com/jackc/tern](https://github.com/jackc/tern)

tern is a stand-alone SQL migration system.

### [github.com/jackc/pgerrcode](https://github.com/jackc/pgerrcode)

pgerrcode contains constants for the PostgreSQL error codes.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Dify-Sandbox
## Introduction
Dify-Sandbox offers a simple way to run untrusted code in a secure environment. It is designed to be used in a multi-tenant environment, where multiple users can submit code to be executed. The code is executed in a sandboxed environment, which restricts the resources and system calls that the code can access.

## Use
### Requirements
DifySandbox currently only supports Linux, as it&#039;s designed for docker containers. It requires the following dependencies:
- libseccomp
- pkg-config
- gcc
- golang 1.20.6

### Steps
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/langgenius/dify-sandbox` and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run ./install.sh to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run ./build/build_[amd64|arm64].sh to build the sandbox binary.
4. Run ./main to start the server.

If you want to debug the server, firstly use build script to build the sandbox library binaries, then debug as you want with your IDE.

## About

The gRPC-Gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler
[protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).
It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which
translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the
[`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotations in your service definitions.

This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Docs

You can read our docs at:

- https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/

## Testimonials

&gt; We use the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of API requests per day,
&gt; and have been since 2018 and through all of that,
&gt; we have never had any issues with it.
&gt;
&gt; _- William Mill, [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/)_

## Background

gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming
languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is
combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional
RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining
backward-compatibility, supporting languages or clients that are not well supported by
gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful
JSON architecture.

This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.
A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all
that&#039;s needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.

## Installation

### Compile from source

The following instructions assume you are using
[Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) for dependency
management. Use a
[tool dependency](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
to track the versions of the following executable packages:

```go
// +build tools

package tools

import (
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot;
)
```

Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running

```sh
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### **Using the `tool` Directive in Go 1.24**

Starting from Go 1.24, the `tool` directive in `go.mod` provides a structured way to track and manage executable dependencies. This replaces the previous workaround of using a separate `tools.go` file with blank imports.

#### **Tracking Tools in `go.mod`**

Instead of manually importing tool dependencies in a Go source file, you can now use the `tool` directive in `go.mod` to declare the tools your project depends on. For example:

```go
module tools

go 1.24

tool (
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
	google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
	google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
)
```

#### **Managing Tool Dependencies**

To add tools to your module, use the `-tool` flag with `go get`:

```sh
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
go get -tool google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
go get -tool google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This automatically updates `go.mod`, adding the tools under the `tool` directive along with `require` statements to ensure version tracking.

### Install Tools

Once the tool dependencies are properly recorded in the `go.mod` file, simply execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
go install tool
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### Download the binaries

You may alternatively download the binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
We generate [SLSA3 signatures](slsa.dev) using the OpenSSF&#039;s [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) during the release process. To verify a release binary:

1. Install the verification tool from [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation).
2. Download the provenance file `attestation.intoto.jsonl` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
3. Run the verifier:

```shell
slsa-verifier -artifact-path &lt;the-binary&gt; -provenance attestation.intoto.jsonl -source github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway -tag &lt;the-tag&gt;
```

Alternatively, see the section on remotely managed plugin versions below.

## Usage

### 1.Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers

`your_service.proto`:

```protobuf
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;

 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
   rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
 }
```

### 2. Generate gRPC stubs

This step generates the gRPC stubs that you can use to implement the service and consume from clients:

Here&#039;s an example `buf.gen.yaml` you can use to generate the stubs with [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf):

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

With this file in place, you can generate your files using `buf generate`.

&gt; For a complete example of using `buf generate` to generate protobuf stubs, see
&gt; [the boilerplate repo](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).
&gt; For more information on generating the stubs with buf, see
&gt; [the official documentation](https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage).

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, here&#039;s an example of what a command
might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . \
    --go_out ./gen/go/ --go_opt paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out ./gen/go/ --go-grpc_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 3. Implement your service in gRPC as usual.

### 4. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

At this point, you have 3 options:

- no further modifications, use the default mapping to HTTP semantics (method, path, etc.)
  - this will work on any `.proto` file, but will not allow setting HTTP paths, request parameters or similar
- additional `.proto` modifications to use a custom mapping
  - relies on parameters in the `.proto` file to set custom HTTP mappings
- no `.proto` modifications, but use an external configuration file
  - relies on an external configuration file to set custom HTTP mappings
  - mostly useful when the source proto file isn&#039;t under your control

#### 1. Using the default mapping

This requires no additional modification to the `.proto` file but does require enabling a specific option when executing the plugin.
The `generate_unbound_methods` should be enabled.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt generate_unbound_methods=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 2. With custom annotations

Add a [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotation to your .proto file

`your_service.proto`:

```diff
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;
+
+import &quot;google/api/annotations.proto&quot;;
+
 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
-  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
+  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
+    option (google.api.http) = {
+      post: &quot;/v1/example/echo&quot;
+      body: &quot;*&quot;
+    };
+  }
 }
```

&gt; You will need to provide the required third party protobuf files to the protobuf compiler.
&gt; If you are using [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf), this dependency can
&gt; be added to the `deps` array in your `buf.yaml` under the name
&gt; `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis`:
&gt;
&gt; ```yaml
&gt; version: v2
&gt; name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
&gt; deps:
&gt;   - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; Always run `buf dep update` after adding a dependency to your `buf.yaml`.

See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
and generated OpenAPI output.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you need to ensure the required
dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found
by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from the
[googleapis repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), and providing
them to `protoc` when running. The files you will need are:

```
google/api/annotations.proto
google/api/field_behavior.proto
google/api/http.proto
google/api/httpbody.proto
```

Here&#039;s what a `protoc` execution might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 3. External configuration

If you do not want to (or cannot) modify the proto file for use with gRPC-Gateway you can
alternatively use an external
[gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
[Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/)
for more information. This is best combined with the `standalone=true` option
to generate a file that can live in its own package, separate from the files
generated by the source protobuf file.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml \
    --grpc-gateway_opt standalone=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 5. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;flag&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog&quot;

  gw &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/proto/gen/go/your/service/v1/your_service&quot;  // Update
)

var (
  // command-line options:
  // gRPC server endpoint
  grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String(&quot;grpc-server-endpoint&quot;,  &quot;localhost:9090&quot;, &quot;gRPC server endpoint&quot;)
)

func run() error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()

  // Register gRPC server endpoint
  // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
  mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
  opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
  err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
  return http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8081&quot;, mux)
}

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  if err := run(); err != nil {
    grpclog.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

### 6. (Optional) Generate OpenAPI definitions using `protoc-gen-openapiv2`

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
  - local: protoc-gen-openapiv2
    out: gen/go
```

To use the custom protobuf annotations supported by `protoc-gen-openapiv2`, we need
another dependency added to our protobuf generation step. If you are using
`buf`, you can add the `buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway` dependency
to your `deps` array:

```yaml
version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
  - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
```

With `protoc` (just the swagger file):

```sh
protoc -I . --openapiv2_out ./gen/openapiv2 \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you will need to copy the protobuf
files from the `protoc-gen-openapiv2/options` directory of this repository,
and providing them to `protoc` when running.

Note that this plugin also supports generating OpenAPI definitions for unannotated methods;
use the `generate_unbound_methods` option to enable this.

It is possible with the HTTP mapping for a gRPC service method to create duplicate mappings
with the only difference being constraints on the path parameter.

`/v1/{name=projects/*}` and `/v1/{name=organizations/*}` both become `/v1/{name}`. When
this occurs the plugin will rename the path parameter with a &quot;\_1&quot; (or &quot;\_2&quot; etc) suffix
to differentiate the different operations. So in the above example, the 2nd path would become
`/v1/{name_1=organizations/*}`. This can also cause OpenAPI clients to URL encode the &quot;/&quot; that is
part of the path parameter as that is what OpenAPI defines in the specification. To allow gRPC gateway to
accept the URL encoded slash and still route the request, use the UnescapingModeAllCharacters or
UnescapingModeLegacy (which is the default currently though may change in future versions). See
[Customizing Your Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/)
for more information.

## Usage with remote plugins

As an alternative to all of the above, you can use `buf` with
[remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage)
to manage plugin versions and generation. An example `buf.gen.yaml` using remote
plugin generation looks like this:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.31.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.3.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/openapiv2:v2.16.2
    out: gen/openapiv2
```

This requires no local installation of any plugins. Be careful to use the same
version of the generator as the runtime library, i.e. if using `v2.16.2`, run

```shell
$ go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2@v2.16.2
```

To get the same version of the runtime in your `go.mod`.

Note that usage of remote plugins is incompatible with usage of external configuration files like [grpc_api_configuration](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/#using-an-external-configuration-file).

## Video intro

This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro to using the gRPC-Gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base: https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Parameters and flags

When using `buf` to generate stubs, flags and parameters are passed through
the `opt` field in your `buf.gen.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

During code generation with `protoc`, flags to gRPC-Gateway tools must be passed
through `protoc` using one of 2 patterns:

- as part of the `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out` `protoc` parameter: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out=&lt;flags&gt;:&lt;path&gt;`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
--openapiv2_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
```

- using additional `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt` parameters: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt=&lt;flag&gt;[,&lt;flag&gt;]*`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
--openapiv2_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
```

The OCI Image Format project creates and maintains the software shipping container image format spec (OCI Image Format).

**[The specification can be found here](spec.md).**

This repository also provides [Go types](specs-go), [intra-blob validation tooling, and JSON Schema](schema).
The Go types and validation should be compatible with the current Go release; earlier Go releases are not supported.

## Running an OCI Image

The OCI Image Format partner project is the [OCI Runtime Spec project](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec).
The Runtime Specification outlines how to run a &quot;[filesystem bundle](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/bundle.md)&quot; that is unpacked on disk.
At a high-level an OCI implementation would download an OCI Image then unpack that image into an OCI Runtime filesystem bundle.
At this point the OCI Runtime Bundle would be run by an OCI Runtime.

This entire workflow supports the UX that users have come to expect from container engines like Docker and rkt: primarily, the ability to run an image with no additional arguments:

- docker run example.com/org/app:v1.0.0
- rkt run example.com/org/app,version=v1.0.0

To support this UX the OCI Image Format contains sufficient information to launch the application on the target platform (e.g. command, arguments, environment variables, etc).

## Distributing an OCI Image

The [OCI Distribution Spec Project](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/) defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content.
This API includes support for pushing and pulling OCI images to an OCI conformant registry.

A: Existing formats can continue to be a proving ground for technologies, as needed.
The OCI Image Format project strives to provide a dependable open specification that can be shared between different tools and be evolved for years or decades of compatibility; as the deb and rpm format have.

Find more [FAQ on the OCI site](https://www.opencontainers.org/faq).

## Roadmap

The [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/milestones) lay out the path to the future improvements.

## Contributing

Development happens on GitHub for the spec.
Issues are used for bugs and actionable items and longer discussions can happen on the [mailing list](#mailing-list).

The specification and code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license found in the `LICENSE` file of this repository.

### Discuss your design

The project welcomes submissions, but please let everyone know what you are working on.

Before undertaking a nontrivial change to this specification, send mail to the [mailing list](#mailing-list) to discuss what you plan to do.
This gives everyone a chance to validate the design, helps prevent duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits.
It also guarantees that the design is sound before code is written; a GitHub pull-request is not the place for high-level discussions.

Typos and grammatical errors can go straight to a pull-request.
When in doubt, start on the [mailing-list](#mailing-list).

### Meetings

Please see the [OCI org repository README](https://github.com/opencontainers/org#meetings) for the most up-to-date information on OCI contributor and maintainer meeting schedules.
You can also find links to meeting agendas and minutes for all prior meetings.

### Mailing List

You can subscribe and join the mailing list on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!forum/dev).

### Markdown style

To keep consistency throughout the Markdown files in the Open Container spec all files should be formatted one sentence per line.
This fixes two things: it makes diffing easier with git and it resolves fights about line wrapping length.
For example, this paragraph will span three lines in the Markdown source.

### Git commit

#### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```text
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer&#039;s Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Joe Smith &lt;joe@gmail.com&gt;
```

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

You can add the sign off when creating the git commit via `git commit -s`.

### Commit Style

Simple house-keeping for clean git history.
Read more on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) or the Discussion section of [`git-commit(1)`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).

1. Separate the subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
   - If there was important/useful/essential conversation or information, copy or include a reference
8. When possible, one keyword to scope the change in the subject (i.e. &quot;README: ...&quot;, &quot;runtime: ...&quot;)
