Private WireGuard® networks made easy

## Overview

This repository contains the majority of Tailscale&#039;s open source code.
Notably, it includes the `tailscaled` daemon and
the `tailscale` CLI tool. The `tailscaled` daemon runs on Linux, Windows,
[macOS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants/), and to varying degrees
on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The Tailscale iOS and Android apps use this repo&#039;s
code, but this repo doesn&#039;t contain the mobile GUI code.

Other [Tailscale repos](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/repositories) of note:

* the Android app is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android
* the Synology package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology
* the QNAP package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-qpkg
* the Chocolatey packaging is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-chocolatey

For background on which parts of Tailscale are open source and why,
see [https://tailscale.com/opensource/](https://tailscale.com/opensource/).

## Using

We serve packages for a variety of distros and platforms at
[https://pkgs.tailscale.com](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/).

## Other clients

The [macOS, iOS, and Windows clients](https://tailscale.com/download)
use the code in this repository but additionally include small GUI
wrappers. The GUI wrappers on non-open source platforms are themselves
not open source.

## Building

We always require the latest Go release, currently Go 1.23. (While we build
releases with our [Go fork](https://github.com/tailscale/go/), its use is not
required.)

```
go install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}
```

If you&#039;re packaging Tailscale for distribution, use `build_dist.sh`
instead, to burn commit IDs and version info into the binaries:

```
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
```

If your distro has conventions that preclude the use of
`build_dist.sh`, please do the equivalent of what it does in your
distro&#039;s way, so that bug reports contain useful version information.

## Bugs

Please file any issues about this code or the hosted service on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).

## Contributing

PRs welcome! But please file bugs. Commit messages should [reference
bugs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls).

We require [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
`Signed-off-by` lines in commits.

See [commit-messages.md](docs/commit-messages.md) (or skim `git log`) for our commit message style.

Grafana Alloy is an open source OpenTelemetry Collector distribution with
built-in Prometheus pipelines and support for metrics, logs, traces, and
profiles.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/sources/assets/alloy_screenshot.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## What can Alloy do?

* **Programmable pipelines**: Use a rich [expression-based syntax][syntax] for
  configuring powerful observability pipelines.

* **OpenTelemetry Collector Distribution**: Alloy is a [distribution][] of
  OpenTelemetry Collector and supports dozens of its components, alongside new
  components that make use of Alloy&#039;s programmable pipelines.

* **Big tent**: Alloy embraces Grafana&#039;s &quot;big tent&quot; philosophy, where Alloy
  can be used with other vendors or open source databases. It has components
  to perfectly integrate with multiple telemetry ecosystems:

  * [OpenTelemetry Collector][]
  * [Prometheus][]
  * [Grafana Loki][]
  * [Grafana Pyroscope][]

* **Kubernetes-native**: Use components to interact with native and custom
  Kubernetes resources; no need to learn how to use a separate Kubernetes
  operator.

* **Shareable pipelines**: Use [modules][] to share your pipelines with the
  world.

* **Automatic workload distribution**: Configure Alloy instances to form a
  [cluster][] for automatic workload distribution.

* **Centralized configuration support**: Alloy supports retrieving its
  configuration from a [server][remotecfg] for centralized configuration
  management.

* **Debugging utilities**: Use the [built-in UI][ui] for visualizing and
  debugging pipelines.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># MinIO Quickstart Guide

[![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/minio/minio.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20V3-blue)](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE)

[![MinIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/.github/logo.svg?sanitize=true)](https://min.io)

MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage solution released under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license. Designed for speed and scalability, it powers AI/ML, analytics, and data-intensive workloads with industry-leading performance.

🔹 S3 API Compatible – Seamless integration with existing S3 tools
🔹 Built for AI &amp; Analytics – Optimized for large-scale data pipelines
🔹 High Performance – Ideal for demanding storage workloads.

AI storage documentation  (https://min.io/solutions/object-storage-for-ai).

This README provides quickstart instructions on running MinIO on bare metal hardware, including container-based installations. For Kubernetes environments, use the [MinIO Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator/blob/master/README.md).

## Container Installation

Use the following commands to run a standalone MinIO server as a container.

Standalone MinIO servers are best suited for early development and evaluation. Certain features such as versioning, object locking, and bucket replication
require distributed deploying MinIO with Erasure Coding. For extended development and production, deploy MinIO with Erasure Coding enabled - specifically,
with a *minimum* of 4 drives per MinIO server. See [MinIO Erasure Code Overview](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html)
for more complete documentation.

### Stable

Run the following command to run the latest stable image of MinIO as a container using an ephemeral data volume:

```sh
podman run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address &quot;:9001&quot;
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded
object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the
root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool. See
[Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool. For application developers,
see &lt;https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/developers/minio-drivers.html&gt; to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To deploy MinIO on with persistent storage, you must map local persistent directories from the host OS to the container using the `podman -v` option.
&gt; For example, `-v /mnt/data:/data` maps the host OS drive at `/mnt/data` to `/data` on the container.

## macOS

Use the following commands to run a standalone MinIO server on macOS.

Standalone MinIO servers are best suited for early development and evaluation. Certain features such as versioning, object locking, and bucket replication require distributed deploying MinIO with Erasure Coding. For extended development and production, deploy MinIO with Erasure Coding enabled - specifically, with a *minimum* of 4 drives per MinIO server. See [MinIO Erasure Code Overview](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html) for more complete documentation.

### Homebrew (recommended)

Run the following command to install the latest stable MinIO package using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Replace ``/data`` with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data.

```sh
brew install minio/stable/minio
minio server /data
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you previously installed minio using `brew install minio` then it is recommended that you reinstall minio from `minio/stable/minio` official repo instead.

```sh
brew uninstall minio
brew install minio/stable/minio
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool.

## Microsoft Windows

To run MinIO on 64-bit Windows hosts, download the MinIO executable from the following URL:

```sh
https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/windows-amd64/minio.exe
```

Use the following command to run a standalone MinIO server on the Windows host. Replace ``D:\`` with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data. You must change the terminal or powershell directory to the location of the ``minio.exe`` executable, *or* add the path to that directory to the system ``$PATH``:

```sh
minio.exe server D:\
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.

## Install from Source

Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source. Source installation is only intended for developers and advanced users. If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow [How to install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install). Minimum version required is [go1.24](https://golang.org/dl/#stable)

```sh
go install github.com/minio/minio@latest
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials.

MinIO strongly recommends *against* using compiled-from-source MinIO servers for production environments.

## Deployment Recommendations

### Allow port access for Firewalls

By default MinIO uses the port 9000 to listen for incoming connections. If your platform blocks the port by default, you may need to enable access to the port.

### ufw

For hosts with ufw enabled (Debian based distros), you can use `ufw` command to allow traffic to specific ports. Use below command to allow access to port 9000

```sh
ufw allow 9000
```

Below command enables all incoming traffic to ports ranging from 9000 to 9010.

```sh
ufw allow 9000:9010/tcp
```

### firewall-cmd

For hosts with firewall-cmd enabled (CentOS), you can use `firewall-cmd` command to allow traffic to specific ports. Use below commands to allow access to port 9000

```sh
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

This command gets the active zone(s). Now, apply port rules to the relevant zones returned above. For example if the zone is `public`, use

```sh
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9000/tcp --permanent
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; `permanent` makes sure the rules are persistent across firewall start, restart or reload. Finally reload the firewall for changes to take effect.

```sh
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### iptables

For hosts with iptables enabled (RHEL, CentOS, etc), you can use `iptables` command to enable all traffic coming to specific ports. Use below command to allow
access to port 9000

```sh
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT
service iptables restart
```

Below command enables all incoming traffic to ports ranging from 9000 to 9010.

```sh
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9000:9010 -j ACCEPT

## Test MinIO Connectivity

### Test using MinIO Console

MinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser. Point your web browser to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; to ensure your server has started successfully.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use `--console-address` to pick a specific interface and port.

### Things to consider

MinIO redirects browser access requests to the configured server port (i.e. `127.0.0.1:9000`) to the configured Console port. MinIO uses the hostname or IP address specified in the request when building the redirect URL. The URL and port *must* be accessible by the client for the redirection to work.

For deployments behind a load balancer, proxy, or ingress rule where the MinIO host IP address or port is not public, use the `MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL` environment variable to specify the external hostname for the redirect. The LB/Proxy must have rules for directing traffic to the Console port specifically.

For example, consider a MinIO deployment behind a proxy `https://minio.example.net`, `https://console.minio.example.net` with rules for forwarding traffic on port :9000 and :9001 to MinIO and the MinIO Console respectively on the internal network. Set `MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL` to `https://console.minio.example.net` to ensure the browser receives a valid reachable URL.

## Test using MinIO Client `mc`

`mc` provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services. Follow the MinIO Client [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart) for further instructions.

## Upgrading MinIO

Upgrades require zero downtime in MinIO, all upgrades are non-disruptive, all transactions on MinIO are atomic. So upgrading all the servers simultaneously is the recommended way to upgrade MinIO.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; requires internet access to update directly from &lt;https://dl.min.io&gt;, optionally you can host any mirrors at &lt;https://my-artifactory.example.com/minio/&gt;

- For deployments that installed the MinIO server binary by hand, use [`mc admin update`](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc-admin/mc-admin-update.html)

```sh
mc admin update &lt;minio alias, e.g., myminio&gt;
```

- For deployments without external internet access (e.g. airgapped environments), download the binary from &lt;https://dl.min.io&gt; and replace the existing MinIO binary let&#039;s say for example `/opt/bin/minio`, apply executable permissions `chmod +x /opt/bin/minio` and proceed to perform `mc admin service restart alias/`.

- For installations using Systemd MinIO service, upgrade via RPM/DEB packages **parallelly** on all servers or replace the binary lets say `/opt/bin/minio` on all nodes, apply executable permissions `chmod +x /opt/bin/minio` and process to perform `mc admin service restart alias/`.

### Upgrade Checklist

- Test all upgrades in a lower environment (DEV, QA, UAT) before applying to production. Performing blind upgrades in production environments carries significant risk.
- Read the release notes for MinIO *before* performing any upgrade, there is no forced requirement to upgrade to latest release upon every release. Some release may not be relevant to your setup, avoid upgrading production environments unnecessarily.
- If you plan to use `mc admin update`, MinIO process must have write access to the parent directory where the binary is present on the host system.
- `mc admin update` is not supported and should be avoided in kubernetes/container environments, please upgrade containers by upgrading relevant container images.
- **We do not recommend upgrading one MinIO server at a time, the product is designed to support parallel upgrades please follow our recommended guidelines.**

![Moby Project logo](docs/static_files/moby-project-logo.png &quot;The Moby Project&quot;)

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.

It provides a &quot;Lego set&quot; of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.

## Principles

Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set its direction.

- Modular: the project includes lots of components that have well-defined functions and APIs that work together.
- Batteries included but swappable: Moby includes enough components to build fully featured container systems, but its modular architecture ensures that most of the components can be swapped by different implementations.
- Usable security: Moby provides secure defaults without compromising usability.
- Developer focused: The APIs are intended to be functional and useful to build powerful tools.
They are not necessarily intended as end user tools but as components aimed at developers.
Documentation and UX is aimed at developers not end users.

## Audience

The Moby Project is intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent and build systems based on containers.
It is not for people looking for a commercially supported system, but for people who want to work and learn with open source code.

## Relationship with Docker

The components and tools in the Moby Project are initially the open source components that Docker and the community have built for the Docker Project.
New projects can be added if they fit with the community goals. Docker is committed to using Moby as the upstream for the Docker Product.
However, other projects are also encouraged to use Moby as an upstream, and to reuse the components in diverse ways, and all these uses will be treated in the same way. External maintainers and contributors are welcomed.

The Moby project is not intended as a location for support or feature requests for Docker products, but as a place for contributors to work on open source code, fix bugs, and make the code more useful.
The releases are supported by the maintainers, community and users, on a best efforts basis only. For customers who want enterprise or commercial support, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/) are the appropriate products for these use cases.

Gatus is a developer-oriented health dashboard that gives you the ability to monitor your services using HTTP, ICMP, TCP, and even DNS
queries as well as evaluate the result of said queries by using a list of conditions on values like the status code,
the response time, the certificate expiration, the body and many others. The icing on top is that each of these health
checks can be paired with alerting via Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Discord, Twilio and many more.

I personally deploy it in my Kubernetes cluster and let it monitor the status of my
core applications: https://status.twin.sh/

## Why Gatus?
Before getting into the specifics, I want to address the most common question:
&gt; Why would I use Gatus when I can just use Prometheus’ Alertmanager, Cloudwatch or even Splunk?

Neither of these can tell you that there’s a problem if there are no clients actively calling the endpoint.
In other words, it&#039;s because monitoring metrics mostly rely on existing traffic, which effectively means that unless
your clients are already experiencing a problem, you won&#039;t be notified.

Gatus, on the other hand, allows you to configure health checks for each of your features, which in turn allows it to
monitor these features and potentially alert you before any clients are impacted.

A sign you may want to look into Gatus is by simply asking yourself whether you&#039;d receive an alert if your load balancer
was to go down right now. Will any of your existing alerts be triggered? Your metrics won’t report an increase in errors
if no traffic makes it to your applications. This puts you in a situation where your clients are the ones
that will notify you about the degradation of your services rather than you reassuring them that you&#039;re working on
fixing the issue before they even know about it.


## Features
The main features of Gatus are:

- **Highly flexible health check conditions**: While checking the response status may be enough for some use cases, Gatus goes much further and allows you to add conditions on the response time, the response body and even the IP address.
- **Ability to use Gatus for user acceptance tests**: Thanks to the point above, you can leverage this application to create automated user acceptance tests.
- **Very easy to configure**: Not only is the configuration designed to be as readable as possible, it&#039;s also extremely easy to add a new service or a new endpoint to monitor.
- **Alerting**: While having a pretty visual dashboard is useful to keep track of the state of your application(s), you probably don&#039;t want to stare at it all day. Thus, notifications via Slack, Mattermost, Messagebird, PagerDuty, Twilio, Google chat and Teams are supported out of the box with the ability to configure a custom alerting provider for any needs you might have, whether it be a different provider or a custom application that manages automated rollbacks.
- **Metrics**
- **Low resource consumption**: As with most Go applications, the resource footprint that this application requires is negligibly small.

## Usage

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick start&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name gatus twinproduction/gatus
```
You can also use GitHub Container Registry if you prefer:
```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name gatus ghcr.io/twin/gatus
```
If you want to create your own configuration, see [Docker](#docker) for information on how to mount a configuration file.
&lt;/details&gt;

Here&#039;s a simple example:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: website                 # Name of your endpoint, can be anything
    url: &quot;https://twin.sh/health&quot;
    interval: 5m                  # Duration to wait between every status check (default: 60s)
    conditions:
      - &quot;[STATUS] == 200&quot;         # Status must be 200
      - &quot;[BODY].status == UP&quot;     # The json path &quot;$.status&quot; must be equal to UP
      - &quot;[RESPONSE_TIME] &lt; 300&quot;   # Response time must be under 300ms

  - name: make-sure-header-is-rendered
    url: &quot;https://example.org/&quot;
    interval: 60s
    conditions:
      - &quot;[STATUS] == 200&quot;                          # Status must be 200
      - &quot;[BODY] == pat(*&lt;h1&gt;Example Domain&lt;/h1&gt;*)&quot; # Body must contain the specified header
```

This example would look similar to this:

![Simple example](.github/assets/example.jpg)

By default, the configuration file is expected to be at `config/config.yaml`.

You can specify a custom path by setting the `GATUS_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

If `GATUS_CONFIG_PATH` points to a directory, all `*.yaml` and `*.yml` files inside said directory and its
subdirectories are merged like so:
- All maps/objects are deep merged (i.e. you could define `alerting.slack` in one file and `alerting.pagerduty` in another file)
- All slices/arrays are appended (i.e. you can define `endpoints` in multiple files and each endpoint will be added to the final list of endpoints)
- Parameters with a primitive value (e.g. `metrics`, `alerting.slack.webhook-url`, etc.) may only be defined once to forcefully avoid any ambiguity
    - To clarify, this also means that you could not define `alerting.slack.webhook-url` in two files with different values. All files are merged into one before they are processed. This is by design.

&gt; 💡 You can also use environment variables in the configuration file (e.g. `$DOMAIN`, `${DOMAIN}`)
&gt;
&gt; See [examples/docker-compose-postgres-storage/config/config.yaml](.examples/docker-compose-postgres-storage/config/config.yaml) for an example.
&gt;
&gt; When your configuration parameter contains a `$` symbol, you have to escape `$` with `$$`.

If you want to test it locally, see [Docker](#docker).

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.

## Getting Started &amp; Documentation

Documentation is available on the [Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform):

- [Introduction](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)
- [Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs)

If you&#039;re new to Terraform and want to get started creating infrastructure, please check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#getting-started) on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#operations-and-development) to continue your learning.

Show off your Terraform knowledge by passing a certification exam.

## Developing Terraform

This repository contains only Terraform core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine. Providers are implemented as plugins, and Terraform can automatically download providers that are published on [the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io). HashiCorp develops some providers, and others are developed by other organizations. For more information, refer to [Plugin development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin).

- To learn more about compiling Terraform and contributing suggested changes, refer to [the contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

- To learn more about how we handle bug reports, refer to the [bug triage guide](./BUGPROCESS.md).

Gitleaks is also available in binary form for many popular platforms and OS types on the [releases page](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases). In addition, Gitleaks can be implemented as a pre-commit hook directly in your repo or as a GitHub action using [Gitleaks-Action](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action).

### Installing

```bash
# MacOS
brew install gitleaks

# Docker (DockerHub)
docker pull zricethezav/gitleaks:latest
docker run -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [SOURCE_PATH]

# Docker (ghcr.io)
docker pull ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:latest
docker run -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:latest [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [SOURCE_PATH]

# From Source (make sure `go` is installed)
git clone https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks.git
cd gitleaks
make build
```

### GitHub Action

Check out the official [Gitleaks GitHub Action](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action)

```
name: gitleaks
on: [pull_request, push, workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  scan:
    name: gitleaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITLEAKS_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.GITLEAKS_LICENSE}} # Only required for Organizations, not personal accounts.
```

### Pre-Commit

1. Install pre-commit from https://pre-commit.com/#install
2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of your repository with the following content:

   ```
   repos:
     - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
       rev: v8.24.2
       hooks:
         - id: gitleaks
   ```

   for a [native execution of gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases) or use the [`gitleaks-docker` pre-commit ID](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml) for executing gitleaks using the [official Docker images](#docker)

3. Auto-update the config to the latest repos&#039; versions by executing `pre-commit autoupdate`
4. Install with `pre-commit install`
5. Now you&#039;re all set!

```
➜ git commit -m &quot;this commit contains a secret&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets.................................................Failed
```

Note: to disable the gitleaks pre-commit hook you can prepend `SKIP=gitleaks` to the commit command
and it will skip running gitleaks

```
➜ SKIP=gitleaks git commit -m &quot;skip gitleaks check&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets................................................Skipped
```

### Commands

⚠️ v8.19.0 introduced a change that deprecated `detect` and `protect`. Those commands are still available but
are hidden in the `--help` menu. Take a look at this [gist](https://gist.github.com/zricethezav/b325bb93ebf41b9c0b0507acf12810d2) for easy command translations.
If you find v8.19.0 broke an existing command (`detect`/`protect`), please open an issue.

There are three scanning modes: `git`, `dir`, and `stdin`.

#### Git

The `git` command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, gitleaks uses the `git log -p` command to scan patches.
You can configure the behavior of `git log -p` with the `log-opts` option.
For example, if you wanted to run gitleaks on a range of commits you could use the following
command: `gitleaks git -v --log-opts=&quot;--all commitA..commitB&quot; path_to_repo`. See the [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) documentation for more information.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.

#### Dir

The `dir` (aliases include `files`, `directory`) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: `gitleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file`.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will scan the current working directory.

#### Stdin

You can also stream data to gitleaks with the `stdin` command. Example: `cat some_file | gitleaks -v stdin`

### Creating a baseline

When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline,
gitleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any gitleaks report. To create a gitleaks report, run gitleaks with the `--report-path` parameter.

```
gitleaks git --report-path gitleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called gitleaks-report.json
```

Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:

```
gitleaks git --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json
```

After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.

## Pre-Commit hook

You can run Gitleaks as a pre-commit hook by copying the example `pre-commit.py` script into
your `.git/hooks/` directory.

## Load Configuration

The order of precedence is:

1. `--config/-c` option:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git --config /home/dev/customgitleaks.toml .
      ```
2. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` with the file path:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG=&quot;/home/dev/customgitleaks.toml&quot;
      gitleaks git .
      ```
3. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` with the file content:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML=`cat customgitleaks.toml`
      gitleaks git .
      ```
4. A `.gitleaks.toml` file within the target path:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git .
      ```

If none of the four options are used, then gitleaks will use the default config.

## Configuration

Gitleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:

```toml
# Title for the gitleaks configuration file.
title = &quot;Custom Gitleaks configuration&quot;

# You have basically two options for your custom configuration:
#
# 1. define your own configuration, default rules do not apply
#
#    use e.g., the default configuration as starting point:
#    https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
#
# 2. extend a configuration, the rules are overwritten or extended
#
#    When you extend a configuration the extended rules take precedence over the
#    default rules. I.e., if there are duplicate rules in both the extended
#    configuration and the default configuration the extended rules or
#    attributes of them will override the default rules.
#    Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain
#    together multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are
#    appended and can contain duplicates.

# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the default gitleaks config built in to the binary
# the latest version is located at:
# https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can provide a path to a configuration to extend from.
# The path is relative to where gitleaks was invoked,
# not the location of the base config.
# path = &quot;common_config.toml&quot;
# If there are any rules you don&#039;t want to inherit, they can be specified here.

Refer to the default [gitleaks config](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml) for examples or follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to the default configuration. Additionally, you can check out [this gitleaks blog post](https://blog.gitleaks.io/stop-leaking-secrets-configuration-2-3-aeed293b1fbf) which covers advanced configuration setups.

### Additional Configuration

#### Composite Rules (Multi-part or `required` Rules)
In v8.28.0 Gitleaks introduced composite rules, which are made up of a single &quot;primary&quot; rule and one or more auxiliary or `required` rules. To create a composite rule, add a `[[rules.required]]` table to the primary rule specifying an `id` and optionally `withinLines` and/or `withinColumns` proximity constraints. A fragment is a chunk of content that Gitleaks processes at once (typically a file, part of a file, or git diff), and proximity matching instructs the primary rule to only report a finding if the auxiliary `required` rules also find matches within the specified area of the fragment.

**Proximity matching:** Using the `withinLines` and `withinColumns` fields instructs the primary rule to only report a finding if the auxiliary `required` rules also find matches within the specified proximity. You can set:

- **`withinLines: N`** - required findings must be within N lines (vertically)
- **`withinColumns: N`** - required findings must be within N characters (horizontally)  
- **Both** - creates a rectangular search area (both constraints must be satisfied)
- **Neither** - fragment-level matching (required findings can be anywhere in the same fragment)

Here are diagrams illustrating each proximity behavior:

```
p = primary captured secret
a = auxiliary (required) captured secret
fragment = section of data gitleaks is looking at


    *Fragment-level proximity*

# Overview

**Eino[&#039;aino]** (pronounced similarly to &quot;I know&quot;) aims to be the ultimate LLM application development framework in Golang. Drawing inspirations from many excellent LLM application development frameworks in the open-source community such as LangChain &amp; LlamaIndex, etc., as well as learning from cutting-edge research and real world applications, Eino offers an LLM application development framework that emphasizes on simplicity, scalability, reliability and effectiveness that better aligns with Golang programming conventions.

What Eino provides are:
- a carefully curated list of **component** abstractions and implementations that can be easily reused and combined to build LLM applications
- a powerful **composition** framework that does the heavy lifting of strong type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection, option assignment, etc. for the user.
- a set of meticulously designed **API** that obsesses on simplicity and clarity.
- an ever-growing collection of best practices in the form of bundled **flows** and **examples**.
- a useful set of tools that covers the entire development cycle, from visualized development and debugging to online tracing and evaluation.

With the above arsenal, Eino can standardize, simplify, and improve efficiency at different stages of the AI application development cycle:

# A quick walkthrough

Use a component directly:
```Go
model, _ := openai.NewChatModel(ctx, config) // create an invokable LLM instance
message, _ := model.Generate(ctx, []*Message{
    SystemMessage(&quot;you are a helpful assistant.&quot;),
    UserMessage(&quot;what does the future AI App look like?&quot;)})
```

Of course, you can do that, Eino provides lots of useful components to use out of the box. But you can do more by using orchestration, for three reasons:
- orchestration encapsulates common patterns of LLM application.
- orchestration solves the difficult problem of processing stream response by the LLM.
- orchestration handles type safety, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment for you.

Eino provides three set of APIs for orchestration

| API      | Characteristics and usage                                             |
| -------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chain    | Simple chained directed graph that can only go forward.               |
| Graph    | Cyclic or Acyclic directed graph. Powerful and flexible.              |
| Workflow | Acyclic graph that supports data mapping at struct field level. |

Let&#039;s create a simple chain: a ChatTemplate followed by a ChatModel.

![](.github/static/img/eino/simple_chain.png)

```Go
chain, _ := NewChain[map[string]any, *Message]().
           AppendChatTemplate(prompt).
           AppendChatModel(model).
           Compile(ctx)

chain.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;what&#039;s your name?&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a graph that uses a ChatModel to generate answer or tool calls, then uses a ToolsNode to execute those tools if needed.

![](.github/static/img/eino/tool_call_graph.png)

```Go
graph := NewGraph[map[string]any, *schema.Message]()

_ = graph.AddChatTemplateNode(&quot;node_template&quot;, chatTpl)
_ = graph.AddChatModelNode(&quot;node_model&quot;, chatModel)
_ = graph.AddToolsNode(&quot;node_tools&quot;, toolsNode)
_ = graph.AddLambdaNode(&quot;node_converter&quot;, takeOne)

_ = graph.AddEdge(START, &quot;node_template&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_template&quot;, &quot;node_model&quot;)
_ = graph.AddBranch(&quot;node_model&quot;, branch)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_tools&quot;, &quot;node_converter&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_converter&quot;, END)

compiledGraph, err := graph.Compile(ctx)
if err != nil {
return err
}
out, err := compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;:&quot;Beijing&#039;s weather this weekend&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a workflow that flexibly maps input &amp; output at the field level:

![](.github/static/img/eino/simple_workflow.png)

```Go
type Input1 struct {
    Input string
}

type Output1 struct {
    Output string
}

type Input2 struct {
    Role schema.RoleType
}

type Output2 struct {
    Output string
}

type Input3 struct {
    Query string
    MetaData string
}

var (
    ctx context.Context
    m model.BaseChatModel
    lambda1 func(context.Context, Input1) (Output1, error)
    lambda2 func(context.Context, Input2) (Output2, error)
    lambda3 func(context.Context, Input3) (*schema.Message, error)
)

wf := NewWorkflow[[]*schema.Message, *schema.Message]()
wf.AddChatModelNode(&quot;model&quot;, m).AddInput(START)
wf.AddLambdaNode(&quot;lambda1&quot;, InvokableLambda(lambda1)).
    AddInput(&quot;model&quot;, MapFields(&quot;Content&quot;, &quot;Input&quot;))
wf.AddLambdaNode(&quot;lambda2&quot;, InvokableLambda(lambda2)).
    AddInput(&quot;model&quot;, MapFields(&quot;Role&quot;, &quot;Role&quot;))
wf.AddLambdaNode(&quot;lambda3&quot;, InvokableLambda(lambda3)).
    AddInput(&quot;lambda1&quot;, MapFields(&quot;Output&quot;, &quot;Query&quot;)).
    AddInput(&quot;lambda2&quot;, MapFields(&quot;Output&quot;, &quot;MetaData&quot;))
wf.End().AddInput(&quot;lambda3&quot;)
runnable, err := wf.Compile(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
our, err := runnable.Invoke(ctx, []*schema.Message{
    schema.UserMessage(&quot;kick start this workflow!&quot;),
})
```

Now let&#039;s create a &#039;ReAct&#039; agent: A ChatModel binds to Tools. It receives input Messages and decides independently whether to call the Tool or output the final result. The execution result of the Tool will again become the input Message for the ChatModel and serve as the context for the next round of independent judgment.

![](.github/static/img/eino/react.png)

We provide a complete implementation for ReAct Agent out of the box in the `flow` package. Check out the code here: [flow/agent/react](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino/blob/main/flow/agent/react/react.go)

Our implementation of ReAct Agent uses Eino&#039;s **graph orchestration** exclusively, which provides the following benefits out of the box:
- Type checking: it makes sure the two nodes&#039; input and output types match at compile time.
- Stream processing: concatenates message stream before passing to chatModel and toolsNode if needed, and copies the stream into callback handlers.
- Concurrency management: the shared state can be safely read and written because the StatePreHandler is concurrency safe.
- Aspect injection: injects callback aspects before and after the execution of ChatModel if the specified ChatModel implementation hasn&#039;t injected itself.
- Option assignment: call options are assigned either globally, to specific component type or to specific node.

For example, you could easily extend the compiled graph with callbacks:
```Go
handler := NewHandlerBuilder().
  OnStartFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, input CallbackInput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onStart, runInfo: %v, input: %v&quot;, info, input)
    }).
  OnEndFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, output CallbackOutput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onEnd, runInfo: %v, out: %v&quot;, info, output)
    }).
  Build()
  
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))
```

or you could easily assign options to different nodes:
```Go
// assign to All nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))

// assign only to ChatModel nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithChatModelOption(WithTemperature(0.5))

// assign only to node_1
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler).DesignateNode(&quot;node_1&quot;))
```

# Key Features

## Rich Components

- Encapsulates common building blocks into **component abstractions**, each have multiple **component implementations** that are ready to be used out of the box.
    - component abstractions such as ChatModel, Tool, ChatTemplate, Retriever, Document Loader, Lambda, etc.
    - each component type has an interface of its own: defined Input &amp; Output Type, defined Option type, and streaming paradigms that make sense.
    - implementations are transparent. Abstractions are all you care about when orchestrating components together.

- Implementations can be nested and captures complex business logic.
    - ReAct Agent, MultiQueryRetriever, Host MultiAgent, etc. They consist of multiple components and non-trivial business logic.
    - They are still transparent from the outside. A MultiQueryRetriever can be used anywhere that accepts a Retriever.

## Powerful Orchestration

- Data flows from Retriever / Document Loaders / ChatTemplate to ChatModel, then flows to Tools and parsed as Final Answer. This directed, controlled flow of data through multiple components can be implemented through **graph orchestration**.
- Component instances are graph nodes, and edges are data flow channels.
- Graph orchestration is powerful and flexible enough to implement complex business logic:
  - type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment are handled by the framework.
  - branch out execution at runtime, read and write global state, or do field level data mapping using workflow(currently in alpha stage).


## Complete Stream Processing

- Stream processing is important because ChatModel outputs chunks of messages in real time as it generates them. It&#039;s especially important with orchestration because more components need to handle streaming data.
- Eino automatically **concatenates** stream chunks for downstream nodes that only accepts non-stream input, such as ToolsNode.
- Eino automatically **boxes** non stream into stream when stream is needed during graph execution.  
- Eino automatically **merges** multiple streams as they converge into a single downward node.
- Eino automatically **copies** stream as they fan out to different downward node, or is passed to callback handlers.
- Orchestration elements such as **branch** and **state handlers** are also stream aware.
- With these streaming processing abilities, the streaming paradigms of components themselves become transparent to the user. 
- A compiled Graph can run with 4 different streaming paradigms:

| Streaming Paradigm | Explanation                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invoke             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns non-stream type O                     |
| Stream             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns stream type StreamReader[O]           |
| Collect            | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns non-stream type O           |
| Transform          | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns stream type StreamReader[O] |

## Highly Extensible Aspects (Callbacks)

- Aspects handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, tracing, metrics, etc., as well as exposing internal details of component implementations.
- Five aspects are supported: **OnStart, OnEnd, OnError, OnStartWithStreamInput, OnEndWithStreamOutput**.
- Developers can easily create custom callback handlers, add them during graph run via options, and they will be invoked during graph run.
- Graph can also inject aspects to those component implementations that do not support callbacks on their own.

# Key Highlights

## 🎯 No code changes

Just run your app with `keploy record`. Real API + integration flows are automatically captured as tests and mocks. *(Keploy uses eBPF under the hood to capture traffic, so you **don’t need** to add any SDKs or modify code.)* 

## 📹 Record and Replay complex Flows
Keploy can record and replay complex, distributed API flows as mocks and stubs.  It&#039;s like having a very light-weight time machine for your tests—saving you tons of time!

👉 [Read the docs on record-replay](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-explained/introduction/)

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/docs/main/static/gif/record-tc.gif&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; alt=&quot;Convert API calls to test cases&quot;/&gt;

## 🐇 Complete Infra‑Virtualization (beyond HTTP mocks)

Unlike tools that only mock HTTP endpoints, Keploy records **databases** (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB), **streaming/queues** (Kafka, RabbitMQ), external APIs, and more. 

It replays them deterministically so you can run tests without re‑provisioning infra.

👉 [Read the docs on infra virtualisation](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-explained/how-keploy-works/)

&lt;img src=&quot;https://keploy-devrel.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Group+1261152745.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Convert API calls to test cases&quot;/&gt;

## 🧪 Combined Test Coverage

If you’re a **developer**, you probably care about *statement* and *branch* coverage — Keploy calculates that for you. 

If you’re a **QA**, you focus more on *API schema* and *business use‑case coverage* — Keploy calculates that too. This way coverage isn’t subjective anymore. 

👉 [Read the docs on coverage](https://keploy.io/docs/server/sdk-installation/go/)

&lt;img src=&quot;https://keploy-devrel.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/keploy+ai+test+gen+for+api+statement+schema+and+branch+coverage.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;ai test gen for api statement schema and branch coverage&quot;/&gt;

## 🤖 Expand API Coverage using AI

Keploy uses existing recordings, Swagger/OpenAPI Schema to find: boundary values, missing/extra fields, wrong types, out‑of‑order sequences, retries/timeouts. 

This helps expand API Schema, Statement, and Branch Coverage.

## Languages &amp;amp; Frameworks (Any stack)

Because Keploy intercepts at the **network layer (eBPF)**, it works with **any language, framework, or runtime**—no SDK required. 
&gt; Note: Some of the dependencies are not open-source by nature because their protocols and parsings are not open-sourced. It&#039;s not supported in Keploy enterprise.

## Features

### Task &amp; Chore Management
**Collaborative**: Create and manage tasks either solo or with family and friends. You can create a group and share or assign some of the tasks or chores with others.

**Natural Language Task Creation**: Describe what you need to do in plain English. Donetick automatically extracts dates, times, and recurrence patterns from phrases like “Change water filter every 6 months” or “Take the trash out every Monday and Tuesday at 6:15 pm.”

**Task Advanced Scheduling**: 
- Supports flexible scheduling: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, specific months, specific days of the week, or even adaptive scheduling — where Donetick learns from historical completions to suggest due dates automatically.
- Due Date vs Completion Date Based Recurrence: Choose whether recurring tasks should be scheduled from the previous due date (ideal for a consistent cadence) or from the actual completion date (useful when tasks are often delayed).
- Assignee Rotation: Automatically rotate task assignments based on who has completed the fewest tasks, randomly, or in turns(round-robin) order.
- Time Tracking &amp; Session Insights: Track how much time you spend on a task whether in a single session or across multiple.
  
**Subtasks with Smart Reset**: Break tasks into smaller steps with subtasks, each trackable on its own. For recurring tasks, subtasks automatically reset when the main task is completed. subtasks can be nested as well!

**Organize with Priorities and Labels**: Organize everything using custom labels and priorities. Labels can be shared across your group, making it easy to filter and sort tasks by category. Priorities help you stay focused  Donetick supports five levels: P1, P2, P3, P4, and No Priority.

**Add Photos**: Attach photos directly to tasks. Supports local storage (WIP) or cloud providers including AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, and other S3-compatible services.

**Things**: A unique feature in Donetick. “Things” let you track data that isn’t a task. A Thing can be a number, boolean (true/false), or plain text. You can also mark tasks as done automatically when a Thing changes to a certain value.

**NFC Tag Support**: Create physical triggers by writing NFC tags that instantly mark tasks as complete when scanned.

### Gamification &amp; Progress
**Points System**: Built-in points system that rewards task completion and tracks your progress over time.

**Completion Restrictions** : You can restrict task completion until a certain time, for example, make a task completable only within the last X hours before its due date. This helps prevent marking tasks as &quot;done&quot; too early.

**Comprehensive Analytics**: See task breakdowns by label, completion status, and other helpful graphs.

### Security &amp; Authentication
**Multi-Factor Authentication**: Supports TOTP-based MFA.

**Multiple Sign-In Options**: Choose from local accounts or any OAuth2 provider that supports OIDC, like Keycloak, Authentik, Authelia, etc. (Tested with Authentik.)

### Notifications &amp; Integrations

**Dashboard View**: If you’re on a larger screen (like a laptop or tablet) and logged in as an admin, Donetick shows a mount-friendly dashboard layout. a full task list, calendar, and recent activity all in one place. Perfect for wall-mounted displays or shared tablets. With the ability for any user to pick their account and complete a task on the go!

**Realtime Sync**: Enable realtime sync to instantly reflect task changes across all connected devices and users.  whether you are adding, editing, or completing a task. It reflects immediately on enabled devices!

**Offline Support**: You can access donetick if you lose connection and navigate some areas, but this is very limited functionality at the moment. 

**Multi-Platform Notifications**: Get reminders through the mobile app (we have an alpha iOS app on TestFlight, and the Android APK is available in releases), as well as via Telegram, Discord, or Pushover.

**Home Assistant Integration**: Manage and view tasks directly within Home Assistant using the official integration. It creates separate to-do lists for each Donetick user. Donetick Home Assistant Integration

### Developer &amp; API Features
**REST API**: Full access to Donetick’s features through a REST API, great for custom automations and integrations. (For external use, we recommend using the eAPI, which offers limited access intended for long-lived access tokens.)

**Webhook System**: Connect Donetick to external systems using flexible webhook support good for custom notification flows or automations.

## Quick Start
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Before running the application, ensure you have a valid `selfhosted.yaml` configuration file. 
&gt; If you don&#039;t have one, create a `selfhosted.yaml` file based on the example provided [here](https://github.com/donetick/donetick/blob/main/config/selfhosted.yaml).
&gt; Place the `selfhosted.yaml` file in the `/config` directory within your application&#039;s root directory 



### Using Docker
1. **Pull the latest image:**
   ```bash
   docker pull donetick/donetick
   ```
2. **Run the container:** Replace `/path/to/host/data` with your preferred data directory:
   ```bash
   docker run -v /path/to/host/data:/donetick-data -p 2021:2021 \
     -e DT_ENV=selfhosted \
     -e DT_SQLITE_PATH=/donetick-data/donetick.db \
     donetick/donetick
   ```

# What is TruffleHog 🐽

TruffleHog is the most powerful secrets **Discovery, Classification, Validation,** and **Analysis** tool. In this context, secret refers to a credential a machine uses to authenticate itself to another machine. This includes API keys, database passwords, private encryption keys, and more...

## Discovery 🔍

TruffleHog can look for secrets in many places including Git, chats, wikis, logs, API testing platforms, object stores, filesystems and more

## Classification 📁

TruffleHog classifies over 800 secret types, mapping them back to the specific identity they belong to. Is it an AWS secret? Stripe secret? Cloudflare secret? Postgres password? SSL Private key? Sometimes it&#039;s hard to tell looking at it, so TruffleHog classifies everything it finds.

## Validation ✅

For every secret TruffleHog can classify, it can also log in to confirm if that secret is live or not. This step is critical to know if there’s an active present danger or not.

## Analysis 🔬

For the 20 some of the most commonly leaked out credential types, instead of sending one request to check if the secret can log in, TruffleHog can send many requests to learn everything there is to know about the secret. Who created it? What resources can it access? What permissions does it have on those resources?

cd trufflehog; go install
```

### Using installation script

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Using installation script, verify checksum signature (requires cosign to be installed)

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -v -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Using installation script to install a specific version

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin &lt;ReleaseTag like v3.56.0&gt;
```

# :closed_lock_with_key: Verifying the artifacts

Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.

You need the following tool to verify signature:

- [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)

Verification steps are as follows:

1. Download the artifact files you want, and the following files from the [releases](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/releases) page.

   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt
   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt.pem
   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt.sig

2. Verify the signature:

   ```shell
   cosign verify-blob &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt&gt; \
   --certificate &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.pem&gt; \
   --signature &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.sig&gt; \
   --certificate-identity-regexp &#039;https://github\.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/\.github/workflows/.+&#039; \
   --certificate-oidc-issuer &quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot;
   ```

3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:

   ```shell
   sha256sum --ignore-missing -c trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt
   ```

Replace `{version}` with the downloaded files version

Alternatively, if you are using the installation script, pass `-v` option to perform signature verification.
This requires Cosign binary to be installed prior to running the installation script.

```

## 4: Scan a GitHub Repo + its Issues and Pull Requests

```bash
trufflehog github --repo=https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys --issue-comments --pr-comments
```

## 5: Scan an S3 bucket for verified keys

```bash
trufflehog s3 --bucket=&lt;bucket name&gt; --results=verified,unknown
```

## 6: Scan S3 buckets using IAM Roles

```bash
trufflehog s3 --role-arn=&lt;iam role arn&gt;
```

## 7: Scan a Github Repo using SSH authentication in Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -v &quot;$HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro&quot; trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest git ssh://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys
```

## 8: Scan individual files or directories

```bash
trufflehog filesystem path/to/file1.txt path/to/file2.txt path/to/dir
```

## 9: Scan a local git repo

Clone the git repo. For example [test keys](git@github.com:trufflesecurity/test_keys.git) repo.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:trufflesecurity/test_keys.git
```

Run trufflehog from the parent directory (outside the git repo).
```bash
$ trufflehog git file://test_keys --results=verified,unknown
```

## 10: Scan GCS buckets for verified secrets

```bash
trufflehog gcs --project-id=&lt;project-ID&gt; --cloud-environment --results=verified,unknown
```

## 11: Scan a Docker image for verified secrets

Use the `--image` flag multiple times to scan multiple images.

```bash
# to scan from a remote registry
trufflehog docker --image trufflesecurity/secrets --results=verified,unknown

# to scan from the local docker daemon
trufflehog docker --image docker://new_image:tag --results=verified,unknown

# to scan from an image saved as a tarball
trufflehog docker --image file://path_to_image.tar --results=verified,unknown
```

## 12: Scan in CI

Set the `--since-commit` flag to your default branch that people merge into (ex: &quot;main&quot;). Set the `--branch` flag to your PR&#039;s branch name (ex: &quot;feature-1&quot;). Depending on the CI/CD platform you use, this value can be pulled in dynamically (ex: [CIRCLE_BRANCH in Circle CI](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/) and [TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH in Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/)). If the repo is cloned and the target branch is already checked out during the CI/CD workflow, then `--branch HEAD` should be sufficient. The `--fail` flag will return an 183 error code if valid credentials are found.

```bash
trufflehog git file://. --since-commit main --branch feature-1 --results=verified,unknown --fail
```

## 13: Scan a Postman workspace

Use the `--workspace-id`, `--collection-id`, `--environment` flags multiple times to scan multiple targets.

```bash
trufflehog postman --token=&lt;postman api token&gt; --workspace-id=&lt;workspace id&gt;
```

## 14: Scan a Jenkins server

```bash
trufflehog jenkins --url https://jenkins.example.com --username admin --password admin
```

## 15: Scan an Elasticsearch server

### Scan a Local Cluster

There are two ways to authenticate to a local cluster with TruffleHog: (1) username and password, (2) service token.

#### Connect to a local cluster with username and password

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --username truffle --password hog
```

#### Connect to a local cluster with a service token

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --service-token ‘AAEWVaWM...Rva2VuaSDZ’
```

### Scan an Elastic Cloud Cluster

To scan a cluster on Elastic Cloud, you’ll need a Cloud ID and API key.

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch \
  --cloud-id &#039;search-prod:dXMtY2Vx...YjM1ODNlOWFiZGRlNjI0NA==&#039; \
  --api-key &#039;MlVtVjBZ...ZSYlduYnF1djh3NG5FQQ==&#039;
```

## 16. Scan a GitHub Repository for Cross Fork Object References and Deleted Commits

The following command will enumerate deleted and hidden commits on a GitHub repository and then scan them for secrets. This is an alpha release feature.

```bash
trufflehog github-experimental --repo https://github.com/&lt;USER&gt;/&lt;REPO&gt;.git --object-discovery
```

In addition to the normal TruffleHog output, the `--object-discovery` flag creates two files in a new `$HOME/.trufflehog` directory: `valid_hidden.txt` and `invalid.txt`. These are used to track state during commit enumeration, as well as to provide users with a complete list of all hidden and deleted commits (`valid_hidden.txt`). If you&#039;d like to automatically remove these files after scanning, please add the flag `--delete-cached-data`.

**Note**: Enumerating all valid commits on a repository using this method takes between 20 minutes and a few hours, depending on the size of your repository. We added a progress bar to keep you updated on how long the enumeration will take. The actual secret scanning runs extremely fast.

For more information on Cross Fork Object References, please [read our blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github).

## 17. Scan Hugging Face

### Scan a Hugging Face Model, Dataset or Space

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --model &lt;model_id&gt; --space &lt;space_id&gt; --dataset &lt;dataset_id&gt;
```

### Scan all Models, Datasets and Spaces belonging to a Hugging Face Organization or User

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --org &lt;orgname&gt; --user &lt;username&gt;
```

(Optionally) When scanning an organization or user, you can skip an entire class of resources with `--skip-models`, `--skip-datasets`, `--skip-spaces` OR a particular resource with `--ignore-models &lt;model_id&gt;`, `--ignore-datasets &lt;dataset_id&gt;`, `--ignore-spaces &lt;space_id&gt;`.

### Scan Discussion and PR Comments

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --model &lt;model_id&gt; --include-discussions --include-prs
```

## 18. Scan stdin Input

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://example/gzipped/data.gz - | gunzip -c | trufflehog stdin
```

# :question: FAQ

- All I see is `🐷🔑🐷  TruffleHog. Unearth your secrets. 🐷🔑🐷` and the program exits, what gives?
  - That means no secrets were detected
- Why is the scan taking a long time when I scan a GitHub org
  - Unauthenticated GitHub scans have rate limits. To improve your rate limits, include the `--token` flag with a personal access token
- It says a private key was verified, what does that mean?
  - Check out our Driftwood blog post to learn how to do this, in short we&#039;ve confirmed the key can be used live for SSH or SSL [Blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood-know-if-private-keys-are-sensitive/)
- Is there an easy way to ignore specific secrets?
  - If the scanned source [supports line numbers](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/d6375ba92172fd830abb4247cca15e3176448c5d/pkg/engine/engine.go#L358-L365), then you can add a `trufflehog:ignore` comment on the line containing the secret to ignore that secrets.

# :newspaper: What&#039;s new in v3?

TruffleHog v3 is a complete rewrite in Go with many new powerful features.

- We&#039;ve **added over 700 credential detectors that support active verification against their respective APIs**.
- We&#039;ve also added native **support for scanning GitHub, GitLab, Docker, filesystems, S3, GCS, Circle CI and Travis CI**.
- **Instantly verify private keys** against millions of github users and **billions** of TLS certificates using our [Driftwood](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood) technology.
- Scan binaries, documents, and other file formats
- Available as a GitHub Action and a pre-commit hook

## What is credential verification?

For every potential credential that is detected, we&#039;ve painstakingly implemented programmatic verification against the API that we think it belongs to. Verification eliminates false positives. For example, the [AWS credential detector](pkg/detectors/aws/aws.go) performs a `GetCallerIdentity` API call against the AWS API to verify if an AWS credential is active.

# :memo: Usage

TruffleHog has a sub-command for each source of data that you may want to scan:

- git
- github
- gitlab
- docker
- s3
- filesystem (files and directories)
- syslog
- circleci
- travisci
- gcs (Google Cloud Storage)
- postman
- jenkins

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/expr-lang/expr?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/expr-lang/expr)

**Expr** is a Go-centric expression language designed to deliver dynamic configurations with unparalleled accuracy, safety, and speed. 
**Expr** combines simple [syntax](https://expr-lang.org/docs/language-definition) with powerful features for ease of use:

```js
// Allow only admins and moderators to moderate comments.
user.Group in [&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;moderator&quot;] || user.Id == comment.UserId
```

```js
// Determine whether the request is in the permitted time window.
request.Time - resource.Age &lt; duration(&quot;24h&quot;)
```

```js
// Ensure all tweets are less than 240 characters.
all(tweets, len(.Content) &lt;= 240)
```

## Features

**Expr** is a safe, fast, and intuitive expression evaluator optimized for the Go language. 
Here are its standout features:

### Safety and Isolation
* **Memory-Safe**: Expr is designed with a focus on safety, ensuring that programs do not access unrelated memory or introduce memory vulnerabilities.
* **Side-Effect-Free**: Expressions evaluated in Expr only compute outputs from their inputs, ensuring no side-effects that can change state or produce unintended results.
* **Always Terminating**: Expr is designed to prevent infinite loops, ensuring that every program will conclude in a reasonable amount of time.

### Go Integration
* **Seamless with Go**: Integrate Expr into your Go projects without the need to redefine types.

### Static Typing
* Ensures type correctness and prevents runtime type errors.
  ```go
  out, err := expr.Compile(`name + age`)
  // err: invalid operation + (mismatched types string and int)
  // | name + age
  // | .....^
  ```

### User-Friendly
* Provides user-friendly error messages to assist with debugging and development.

### Flexibility and Utility
* **Rich Operators**: Offers a reasonable set of basic operators for a variety of applications.
* **Built-in Functions**: Functions like `all`, `none`, `any`, `one`, `filter`, and `map` are provided out-of-the-box.

### Performance
* **Optimized for Speed**: Expr stands out in its performance, utilizing an optimizing compiler and a bytecode virtual machine. Check out these [benchmarks](https://github.com/antonmedv/golang-expression-evaluation-comparison#readme) for more details.

Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of
configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts),
and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

Flux version 2 (&quot;v2&quot;) is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes&#039;
API extension system, and to integrate with Prometheus and other core
components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. In version 2, Flux supports
multi-tenancy and support for syncing an arbitrary number of Git
repositories, among other long-requested features.

Flux v2 is constructed with the [GitOps Toolkit](#gitops-toolkit), a
set of composable APIs and specialized tools for building Continuous
Delivery on top of Kubernetes.

Flux is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/)) graduated project, used in
production by various [organisations](https://fluxcd.io/adopters) and [cloud providers](https://fluxcd.io/ecosystem).

## Quickstart and documentation

To get started check out this [guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/get-started/)
on how to bootstrap Flux on Kubernetes and deploy a sample application in a GitOps manner.

For more comprehensive documentation, see the following guides:
- [Ways of structuring your repositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/repository-structure/)
- [Manage Helm Releases](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/helmreleases/)
- [Automate image updates to Git](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/image-update/)  
- [Manage Kubernetes secrets with Flux and SOPS](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/)  

If you need help, please refer to our **[Support page](https://fluxcd.io/support/)**.

## GitOps Toolkit

The GitOps Toolkit is the set of APIs and controllers that make up the
runtime for Flux v2. The APIs comprise Kubernetes custom resources,
which can be created and updated by a cluster user, or by other
automation tooling.

![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxcd/flux2/main/docs/diagrams/fluxcd-controllers.png)

You can use the toolkit to extend Flux, or to build your own systems
for continuous delivery -- see [the developer
guides](https://fluxcd.io/flux/gitops-toolkit/source-watcher/).

`kustomize` lets you customize raw, template-free YAML
files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML
untouched and usable as is.

`kustomize` targets kubernetes; it understands and can
patch [kubernetes style] API objects.  It&#039;s like
[`make`], in that what it does is declared in a file,
and it&#039;s like [`sed`], in that it emits edited text.

This tool is sponsored by [sig-cli] ([KEP]).

## kubectl integration

To find the kustomize version embedded in recent versions of kubectl, run `kubectl version`:

```sh
&gt; kubectl version --client
Client Version: v1.31.0
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
```

The kustomize build flow at [v2.0.3] was added
to [kubectl v1.14][kubectl announcement].  The kustomize
flow in kubectl remained frozen at v2.0.3 until kubectl v1.21,
which [updated it to v4.0.5][kust-in-kubectl update]. It will
be updated on a regular basis going forward, and such updates
will be reflected in the Kubernetes release notes.

| Kubectl version | Kustomize version |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| &lt; v1.14         | n/a               |
| v1.14-v1.20     | v2.0.3            |
| v1.21           | v4.0.5            |
| v1.22           | v4.2.0            |
| v1.23           | v4.4.1            |
| v1.24           | v4.5.4            |

## Usage


### 1) Make a [kustomization] file

In some directory containing your YAML [resource]
files (deployments, services, configmaps, etc.), create a
[kustomization] file.

This file should declare those resources, and any
customization to apply to them, e.g. _add a common
label_.

```

base: kustomization + resources

kustomization.yaml                                      deployment.yaml                                                 service.yaml

                                                        |             - containerPort: 6060                     |
                                                        +-------------------------------------------------------+

```

File structure:

&gt; ```
&gt; ~/someApp
&gt; ├── deployment.yaml
&gt; ├── kustomization.yaml
&gt; └── service.yaml
&gt; ```

The resources in this directory could be a fork of
someone else&#039;s configuration.  If so, you can easily
rebase from the source material to capture
improvements, because you don&#039;t modify the resources
directly.

Generate customized YAML with:

```
kustomize build ~/someApp
```

The YAML can be directly [applied] to a cluster:

&gt; ```
&gt; kustomize build ~/someApp | kubectl apply -f -
&gt; ```


### 2) Create [variants] using [overlays]

Manage traditional [variants] of a configuration - like
_development_, _staging_ and _production_ - using
[overlays] that modify a common [base].

```


File structure:
&gt; ```
&gt; ~/someApp
&gt; ├── base
&gt; │   ├── deployment.yaml
&gt; │   ├── kustomization.yaml
&gt; │   └── service.yaml
&gt; └── overlays
&gt;     ├── development
&gt;     │   ├── cpu_count.yaml
&gt;     │   ├── kustomization.yaml
&gt;     │   └── replica_count.yaml
&gt;     └── production
&gt;         ├── cpu_count.yaml
&gt;         ├── kustomization.yaml
&gt;         └── replica_count.yaml
&gt; ```

Take the work from step (1) above, move it into a
`someApp` subdirectory called `base`, then
place overlays in a sibling directory.

An overlay is just another kustomization, referring to
the base, and referring to patches to apply to that
base.

This arrangement makes it easy to manage your
configuration with `git`.  The base could have files
from an upstream repository managed by someone else.
The overlays could be in a repository you own.
Arranging the repo clones as siblings on disk avoids
the need for git submodules (though that works fine, if
you are a submodule fan).

Generate YAML with

```sh
kustomize build ~/someApp/overlays/production
```

The YAML can be directly [applied] to a cluster:

&gt; ```sh
&gt; kustomize build ~/someApp/overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -
&gt; ```

## Changelog

See [the list of releases][6] to find out about feature changes.

### Velero compatibility matrix

The following is a list of the supported Kubernetes versions for each Velero version.

| Velero version | Expected Kubernetes version compatibility | Tested on Kubernetes version        |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1.17           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.31.7, 1.32.3, 1.33.1, and 1.34.0          |
| 1.16           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.31.4, 1.32.3, and 1.33.0          |
| 1.15           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.28.8, 1.29.8, 1.30.4 and 1.31.1   |
| 1.14           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.27.9, 1.28.9, and 1.29.4          |
| 1.13           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.26.5, 1.27.3, 1.27.8, and 1.28.3  |
| 1.12           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.25.7, 1.26.5, 1.26.7, and 1.27.3  |
| 1.11           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.23.10, 1.24.9, 1.25.5, and 1.26.1 |

Velero supports IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack environments. Support for this was tested against Velero v1.8.

The Velero maintainers are continuously working to expand testing coverage, but are not able to test every combination of Velero and supported Kubernetes versions for each Velero release. The table above is meant to track the current testing coverage and the expected supported Kubernetes versions for each Velero version.

If you are interested in using a different version of Kubernetes with a given Velero version, we&#039;d recommend that you perform testing before installing or upgrading your environment. For full information around capabilities within a release, also see the Velero [release notes](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases) or Kubernetes [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/CHANGELOG). See the Velero [support page](https://velero.io/docs/latest/support-process/) for information about supported versions of Velero.

For each release, Velero maintainers run the test to ensure the upgrade path from n-2 minor release.  For example, before the release of v1.10.x, the test will verify that the backup created by v1.9.x and v1.8.x can be restored using the build to be tagged as v1.10.x.

# pgx - PostgreSQL Driver and Toolkit

pgx is a pure Go driver and toolkit for PostgreSQL.

The pgx driver is a low-level, high performance interface that exposes PostgreSQL-specific features such as `LISTEN` /
`NOTIFY` and `COPY`. It also includes an adapter for the standard `database/sql` interface.

The toolkit component is a related set of packages that implement PostgreSQL functionality such as parsing the wire protocol
and type mapping between PostgreSQL and Go. These underlying packages can be used to implement alternative drivers,
proxies, load balancers, logical replication clients, etc.

## Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;

	&quot;github.com/jackc/pgx/v5&quot;
)

func main() {
	// urlExample := &quot;postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name&quot;
	conn, err := pgx.Connect(context.Background(), os.Getenv(&quot;DATABASE_URL&quot;))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Unable to connect to database: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer conn.Close(context.Background())

	var name string
	var weight int64
	err = conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), &quot;select name, weight from widgets where id=$1&quot;, 42).Scan(&amp;name, &amp;weight)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;QueryRow failed: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	fmt.Println(name, weight)
}
```

See the [getting started guide](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/wiki/Getting-started-with-pgx) for more information.

## Features

* Support for approximately 70 different PostgreSQL types
* Automatic statement preparation and caching
* Batch queries
* Single-round trip query mode
* Full TLS connection control
* Binary format support for custom types (allows for much quicker encoding/decoding)
* `COPY` protocol support for faster bulk data loads
* Tracing and logging support
* Connection pool with after-connect hook for arbitrary connection setup
* `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY`
* Conversion of PostgreSQL arrays to Go slice mappings for integers, floats, and strings
* `hstore` support
* `json` and `jsonb` support
* Maps `inet` and `cidr` PostgreSQL types to `netip.Addr` and `netip.Prefix`
* Large object support
* NULL mapping to pointer to pointer
* Supports `database/sql.Scanner` and `database/sql/driver.Valuer` interfaces for custom types
* Notice response handling
* Simulated nested transactions with savepoints

## Choosing Between the pgx and database/sql Interfaces

The pgx interface is faster. Many PostgreSQL specific features such as `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` and `COPY` are not available
through the `database/sql` interface.

The pgx interface is recommended when:

1. The application only targets PostgreSQL.
2. No other libraries that require `database/sql` are in use.

It is also possible to use the `database/sql` interface and convert a connection to the lower-level pgx interface as needed.

## Testing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup instructions.

## Architecture

See the presentation at Golang Estonia, [PGX Top to Bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXMSWhcHCf8) for a description of pgx architecture.

## Supported Go and PostgreSQL Versions

pgx supports the same versions of Go and PostgreSQL that are supported by their respective teams. For [Go](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy) that is the two most recent major releases and for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) the major releases in the last 5 years. This means pgx supports Go 1.24 and higher and PostgreSQL 13 and higher. pgx also is tested against the latest version of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/).

## Version Policy

pgx follows semantic versioning for the documented public API on stable releases. `v5` is the latest stable major version.

## PGX Family Libraries

### [github.com/jackc/pglogrepl](https://github.com/jackc/pglogrepl)

pglogrepl provides functionality to act as a client for PostgreSQL logical replication.

### [github.com/jackc/pgmock](https://github.com/jackc/pgmock)

pgmock offers the ability to create a server that mocks the PostgreSQL wire protocol. This is used internally to test pgx by purposely inducing unusual errors. pgproto3 and pgmock together provide most of the foundational tooling required to implement a PostgreSQL proxy or MitM (such as for a custom connection pooler).

### [github.com/jackc/tern](https://github.com/jackc/tern)

tern is a stand-alone SQL migration system.

### [github.com/jackc/pgerrcode](https://github.com/jackc/pgerrcode)

pgerrcode contains constants for the PostgreSQL error codes.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

- Find and use [popular software packaged as Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) to run in Kubernetes
- Share your own applications as Helm Charts
- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
- Manage releases of Helm packages

## Helm in a Handbasket

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Helm Development and Stable Versions

Helm v4 is currently under development on the `main` branch. This is unstable and the APIs within the Go SDK and at the command line are changing.
Helm v3 (current stable) is maintained on the `dev-v3` branch. APIs there follow semantic versioning.

## Install

Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest).

Unpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!

If you want to use a package manager:

## Docs

Get started with the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://helm.sh/docs).

## Roadmap

The [Helm roadmap uses GitHub milestones](https://github.com/helm/helm/milestones) to track the progress of the project.

The development of Helm v4 is currently happening on the `main` branch while the development of Helm v3, the stable branch, is happening on the `dev-v3` branch. Changes should be made to the `main` branch prior to being added to the `dev-v3` branch so that all changes are carried along to Helm v4.

## What is Optimism?

[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) is a project dedicated to scaling Ethereum&#039;s technology and expanding its ability to coordinate people from across the world to build effective decentralized economies and governance systems. The [Optimism Collective](https://www.optimism.io/vision) builds open-source software that powers scalable blockchains and aims to address key governance and economic challenges in the wider Ethereum ecosystem. Optimism operates on the principle of **impact=profit**, the idea that individuals who positively impact the Collective should be proportionally rewarded with profit. **Change the incentives and you change the world.**

In this repository you&#039;ll find numerous core components of the OP Stack, the decentralized software stack maintained by the Optimism Collective that powers Optimism and forms the backbone of blockchains like [OP Mainnet](https://explorer.optimism.io/) and [Base](https://base.org). The OP Stack is designed to be aggressively open-source — you are welcome to explore, modify, and extend this code.

## Documentation

- If you want to build on top of OP Mainnet, refer to the [Optimism Documentation](https://docs.optimism.io)
- If you want to build your own OP Stack based blockchain, refer to the [OP Stack Guide](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started) and make sure to understand this repository&#039;s [Development and Release Process](#development-and-release-process)

## Specification

Detailed specifications for the OP Stack can be found within the [OP Stack Specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) repository.

## Community

General discussion happens most frequently on the [Optimism discord](https://discord.gg/optimism).
Governance discussion can also be found on the [Optimism Governance Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/).

## Contributing

The OP Stack is a collaborative project. By collaborating on free, open software and shared standards, the Optimism Collective aims to prevent siloed software development and rapidly accelerate the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. Come contribute, build the future, and redefine power, together.

## Development and Release Process

### Overview

Please read this section carefully if you&#039;re planning to fork or make frequent PRs into this repository.

### Production Releases

Production releases are always tags, versioned as `&lt;component-name&gt;/v&lt;semver&gt;`.
For example, an `op-node` release might be versioned as `op-node/v1.1.2`, and  smart contract releases might be versioned as `op-contracts/v1.0.0`.
Release candidates are versioned in the format `op-node/v1.1.2-rc.1`.
We always start with `rc.1` rather than `rc`.

For contract releases, refer to the GitHub release notes for a given release which will list the specific contracts being released. Not all contracts are considered production ready within a release and many are under active development.

Tags of the form `v&lt;semver&gt;`, such as `v1.1.4`, indicate releases of all Go code only, and **DO NOT** include smart contracts.
This naming scheme is required by Golang.
In the above list, this means these `v&lt;semver&gt;` releases contain all `op-*` components and exclude all `contracts-*` components.

`op-geth` embeds upstream geth’s version inside its own version as follows: `vMAJOR.GETH_MAJOR GETH_MINOR GETH_PATCH.PATCH`.
Basically, geth’s version is our minor version.
For example if geth is at `v1.12.0`, the corresponding op-geth version would be `v1.101200.0`.
Note that we pad out to three characters for the geth minor version and two characters for the geth patch version.
Since we cannot left-pad with zeroes, the geth major version is not padded.

See the [Node Software Releases](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/releases) page of the documentation for more information about releases for the latest node components.

The full set of components that have releases are:

- `op-batcher`
- `op-contracts`
- `op-challenger`
- `op-node`
- `op-proposer`

All other components and packages should be considered development components only and do not have releases.

### Development branch

The primary development branch is [`develop`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/).
`develop` contains the most up-to-date software that remains backwards compatible with the latest experimental [network deployments](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/networks).
If you&#039;re making a backwards compatible change, please direct your pull request towards `develop`.

**Changes to contracts within `packages/contracts-bedrock/src` are usually NOT considered backwards compatible.**
Some exceptions to this rule exist for cases in which we absolutely must deploy some new contract after a tag has already been fully deployed.
If you&#039;re changing or adding a contract and you&#039;re unsure about which branch to make a PR into, default to using a feature branch.
Feature branches are typically used when there are conflicts between 2 projects touching the same code, to avoid conflicts from merging both into `develop`.

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/blackbox-exporter/status)][quay]

The blackbox exporter allows blackbox probing of endpoints over
HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP and gRPC.

## Running this software

### From binaries

Download the most suitable binary from [the releases tab](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/releases)

Then:

    ./blackbox_exporter &lt;flags&gt;


### Using the docker image

*Note: You may want to [enable ipv6 in your docker configuration](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/)*

    docker run --rm \
      -p 9115/tcp \
      --name blackbox_exporter \
      -v $(pwd):/config \
      quay.io/prometheus/blackbox-exporter:latest --config.file=/config/blackbox.yml

### Checking the results

Visiting [http://localhost:9115/probe?target=google.com&amp;module=http_2xx](http://localhost:9115/probe?target=google.com&amp;module=http_2xx)
will return metrics for a HTTP probe against google.com. The `probe_success`
metric indicates if the probe succeeded. Adding a `debug=true` parameter
will return debug information for that probe.

Metrics concerning the operation of the exporter itself are available at the
endpoint &lt;http://localhost:9115/metrics&gt;.

### TLS and basic authentication

The Blackbox Exporter supports TLS and basic authentication. This enables better
control of the various HTTP endpoints.

To use TLS and/or basic authentication, you need to pass a configuration file
using the `--web.config.file` parameter. The format of the file is described
[in the exporter-toolkit repository](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit/blob/master/docs/web-configuration.md).

Note that the TLS and basic authentication settings affect all HTTP endpoints:
/metrics for scraping, /probe for probing, and the web UI.

### Controlling log level for probe logs

It is possible to control the level at which probe logs related to a scrape are output as.

Probe logs default to `debug` level, and can be controlled by the `--log.prober` flag.
This means that probe scrape logs will not be output unless the level configured for the probe logger via `--log.prober` is &gt;= the level configured for the blackbox_exporter via `--log.level`.

Sample output demonstrating the use and effect of these flags can be seen below.

&gt; _Note_
&gt;
&gt; All log samples below used the following basic `blackbox.yml` configuration file and contain the probe logs of a single scrape generated by `curl`

```bash
# blackbox.yml
modules:
  http_2xx:
    prober: http

# generate probe
curl &quot;http://localhost:9115/probe?target=prometheus.io&amp;module=http_2xx&quot;
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Example output with `--log.level=info` and `--log.prober=debug` (default)&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
./blackbox_exporter --config.file ./blackbox.yml --log.level=info --log.prober=debug

## Building the software

### Local Build

    make


### Building with Docker

After a successful local build:

    docker build -t blackbox_exporter .

## [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md)

Blackbox exporter is configured via a [configuration file](CONFIGURATION.md) and command-line flags (such as what configuration file to load, what port to listen on, and the logging format and level).

Blackbox exporter can reload its configuration file at runtime. If the new configuration is not well-formed, the changes will not be applied.
A configuration reload is triggered by sending a `SIGHUP` to the Blackbox exporter process or by sending a HTTP POST request to the `/-/reload` endpoint.

To view all available command-line flags, run `./blackbox_exporter -h`.

To specify which [configuration file](CONFIGURATION.md) to load, use the `--config.file` flag.

Additionally, an [example configuration](example.yml) is also available.

HTTP, HTTPS (via the `http` prober), DNS, TCP socket, ICMP and gRPC (see permissions section) are currently supported.
Additional modules can be defined to meet your needs.

The timeout of each probe is automatically determined from the `scrape_timeout` in the [Prometheus config](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/#configuration-file), slightly reduced to allow for network delays. 
This can be further limited by the `timeout` in the Blackbox exporter config file. If neither is specified, it defaults to 120 seconds.

## Prometheus Configuration

Blackbox exporter implements the multi-target exporter pattern, so we advice
to read the guide [Understanding and using the multi-target exporter pattern
](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/multi-target-exporter/) to get the general
idea about the configuration.

The blackbox exporter needs to be passed the target as a parameter, this can be
done with relabelling.

Example config:
```yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: &#039;blackbox&#039;
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [http_2xx]  # Look for a HTTP 200 response.
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - http://prometheus.io    # Target to probe with http.
        - https://prometheus.io   # Target to probe with https.
        - http://example.com:8080 # Target to probe with http on port 8080.
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115  # The blackbox exporter&#039;s real hostname:port.
  - job_name: &#039;blackbox_exporter&#039;  # collect blackbox exporter&#039;s operational metrics.
    static_configs:
      - targets: [&#039;127.0.0.1:9115&#039;]
```

HTTP probes can accept an additional `hostname` parameter that will set `Host` header and TLS SNI. This can be especially useful with `dns_sd_config`:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: blackbox_all
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [ http_2xx ]  # Look for a HTTP 200 response.
    dns_sd_configs:
      - names:
          - example.com
          - prometheus.io
        type: A
        port: 443
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
        replacement: https://$1/  # Make probe URL be like https://1.2.3.4:443/
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115  # The blackbox exporter&#039;s real hostname:port.
      - source_labels: [__meta_dns_name]
        target_label: __param_hostname  # Make domain name become &#039;Host&#039; header for probe requests
      - source_labels: [__meta_dns_name]
        target_label: vhost  # and store it in &#039;vhost&#039; label
```

## Permissions

The ICMP probe requires elevated privileges to function:

* *Windows*: Administrator privileges are required.
* *Linux*: either a user with a group within `net.ipv4.ping_group_range`, the
  `CAP_NET_RAW` capability or the root user is required.
  * Your distribution may configure `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` by default in
    `/etc/sysctl.conf` or similar. If not you can set
    `net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0  2147483647` to allow any user the ability
    to use ping.
  * Alternatively the capability can be set by executing `setcap cap_net_raw+ep
    blackbox_exporter`
* *BSD*: root user is required.
* *OS X*: No additional privileges are needed.
