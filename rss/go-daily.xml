![OAuth2 Proxy](docs/static/img/logos/OAuth2_Proxy_horizontal.svg)

OAuth2-Proxy is a flexible, open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. It provides a simple and secure way to protect your web applications with OAuth2 / OIDC authentication. As a reverse proxy, it intercepts requests to your application and redirects users to an OAuth2 provider for authentication. As a middleware, it can be seamlessly integrated into your existing infrastructure to handle authentication for multiple applications.

OAuth2-Proxy supports a lot of OAuth2 as well as OIDC providers. Either through a generic OIDC client or a specific implementation for Google, Microsoft Entra ID, GitHub, login.gov and others. Through specialised provider implementations oauth2-proxy can extract more details about the user like preferred usernames and groups. Those details can then be forwarded as HTTP headers to your upstream applications.

![Simplified Architecture](docs/static/img/simplified-architecture.svg)

## Get Started

OAuth2-Proxy&#039;s [Installation Docs](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/installation) cover how to install and configure your setup. Additionally you can take a further look at the [example setup files](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/tree/master/contrib/local-environment).

## Releases

### Binaries
We publish oauth2-proxy as compiled binaries on GitHub for all major architectures as well as more exotic ones like `ppc64le` as well as `s390x`.

Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/latest).

### Images

From `v7.6.0` and up the base image has been changed from Alpine to [GoogleContainerTools/distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).
This image comes with even fewer installed dependencies and thus should improve security. The image therefore is also slightly smaller than Alpine.
For debugging purposes (and those who really need it. e.g. `armv6`) we still provide images based on Alpine. The tags of these images are suffixed with `-alpine`.

Since 2023-11-18 we build nightly images directly from the `master` branch and provide them at `quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy-nightly`.
These images are considered unstable and therefore should **NOT** be used for production purposes unless you know what you&#039;re doing.

&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; SSH3 is probably going to change its name. It is still the SSH Connection Protocol (RFC4254) running on top of HTTP/3 Extended connect, but the required changes are heavy and
&gt; too distant from the philosophy of popular SSH implementations to be considered for integration. The [specification draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3/) has already been renamed (&quot;Remote Terminals over HTTP/3&quot;),
&gt; but we need some time to come up with a nice permanent name.

# SSH3: faster and rich secure shell using HTTP/3
SSH3 is a complete revisit of the SSH
protocol, mapping its semantics on top of the HTTP mechanisms. It comes from our research work and we (researchers) recently proposed it as an [Internet-Draft](https://www.ietf.org/how/ids/) ([draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3/)).

In a nutshell, SSH3 uses [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000)+[TLS1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446) for
secure channel establishment and the [HTTP Authorization](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-authorization) mechanisms for user authentication.
Among others, SSH3 allows the following improvements:
- Significantly faster session establishment
- New HTTP authentication methods such as [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) in addition to classical SSH authentication
- Robustness to port scanning attacks: your SSH3 server can be made **invisible** to other Internet users
- UDP port forwarding in addition to classical TCP port forwarding
- All the features allowed by the modern QUIC protocol: including connection migration (soon) and multipath connections

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Quickly want to get started ? Checkout how to [install SSH3](#installing-ssh3). You will learn to [setup an SSH3 server](#deploying-an-ssh3-server) and [use the SSH3 client](#using-the-ssh3-client).

## ⚡ SSH3 is faster
Faster for session establishment, not throughput ! SSH3 offers a significantly faster session establishment than SSHv2. Establishing a new session with SSHv2 can take 5 to 7 network round-trip times, which can easily be noticed by the user. SSH3 only needs 3 round-trip times. The keystroke latency in a running session is unchanged.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;resources/figures/ssh3_100ms_rtt.gif&quot;/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;SSH3 (top) VS SSHv2 (bottom) session establishement with a 100ms ping towards the server.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## 🔒 SSH3 security
While SSHv2 defines its own protocols for user authentication and secure channel establishment, SSH3 relies on the robust and time-tested mechanisms of TLS 1.3, QUIC and HTTP. These protocols are already extensively used to secure security-critical applications on the Internet such as e-commerce and Internet banking.

SSH3 already implements the common password-based and public-key (RSA and EdDSA/ed25519) authentication methods. It also supports new authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and allows logging in to your servers using your Google/Microsoft/Github accounts.

### 🧪 SSH3 is still experimental
While SSH3 shows promise for faster session establishment, it is still at an early proof-of-concept stage. As with any new complex protocol, **expert cryptographic review over an extended timeframe is required before reasonable security conclusions can be made**.

We are developing SSH3 as an open source project to facilitate community feedback and analysis. However, we **cannot yet endorse its appropriateness for production systems** without further peer review. Please collaborate with us if you have relevant expertise!

### 🥷 Do not deploy the SSH3 server on your production servers for now
Given the current prototype state, we advise *testing SSH3 in sandboxed environments or private networks*. Be aware that making experimental servers directly Internet-accessible could introduce risk before thorough security vetting.

While [hiding](#-your-ssh3-public-server-can-be-hidden) servers behind secret paths has potential benefits, it does not negate the need for rigorous vulnerability analysis before entering production. We are excited by SSH3&#039;s future possibilities but encourage additional scrutiny first.

## 🥷 Your SSH3 public server can be hidden
Using SSH3, you can avoid the usual stress of scanning and dictionary attacks against your SSH server. Similarly to your secret Google Drive documents, your SSH3 server can be hidden behind a secret link and only answer to authentication attempts that made an HTTP request to this specific link, like the following:

    ssh3-server -bind 192.0.2.0:443 -url-path &lt;my-long-secret&gt;

By replacing `&lt;my-long-secret&gt;` by, let&#039;s say, the random value `M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU`, your SSH3 server will only answer to SSH3 connection attempts made to the URL `https://192.0.2.0:443/M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU` and it will respond a `404 Not Found` to other requests. Attackers and crawlers on the Internet can therefore not detect the presence of your SSH3 server. They will only see a simple web server answering 404 status codes to every request.

**NOTE WELL**: placing your SSH3 server behind a secret URL may reduce the impact of scanning attacks but will and must *never* replace classical authentication mechanisms. The secret link should only be used to avoid your host to be discovered. Knowing the secret URL should not grant someone access to your server. Use the classical authentication mechanisms described above to protect your server. 

## 💐 SSH3 is already feature-rich
SSH3 provides new feature that could not be provided by the SSHv2 protocol.

### Brand new features
- **UDP port forwarding**: you can now access your QUIC, DNS, RTP or any UDP-based server that are only reachable from your SSH3 host.
UDP packets are forwarded using QUIC datagrams.
- **X.509 certificates**: you can now use your classical HTTPS certificates to authenticate your SSH3 server. This mechanism is more secure than the classical SSHv2 host key mechanism. Certificates can be obtained easily using LetsEncrypt for instance.
- **Hiding** your server behind a secret link.
- **Keyless** secure user authentication using **OpenID Connect**. You can connect to your SSH3 server using the SSO of your company or your Google/Github account, and you don&#039;t need to copy the public keys of your users anymore.

### Famous OpenSSH features implemented
This SSH3 implementation already provides many of the popular features of OpenSSH, so if you are used to OpenSSH, the process of adopting SSH3 will be smooth. Here is a list of some OpenSSH features that SSH3 also implements:
- Parses `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server
- Certificate-based server authentication
- `known_hosts` mechanism when X.509 certificates are not used.
- Automatically using the `ssh-agent` for public key authentication
- SSH agent forwarding to use your local keys on your remote server
- Direct TCP port forwarding (reverse port forwarding will be implemented in the future)
- Proxy jump (see the `-proxy-jump` parameter). If A is an SSH3 client and B and C are both SSH3 servers, you can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. The proxy uses UDP forwarding to forward the QUIC packets from A to C, so B cannot decrypt the traffic A&lt;-&gt;C SSH3 traffic.
- Parses `~/.ssh/config` on the client and handles the `Hostname`, `User`, `Port` and `IdentityFile` config options (the other options are currently ignored). Also parses a new `UDPProxyJump` that behaves similarly to OpenSSH&#039;s `ProxyJump`.

## 🙏 Community support
Help us progress SSH3 responsibly! We welcome capable security researchers to review our codebase and provide feedback. Please also connect us with relevant standards bodies to potentially advance SSH3 through the formal IETF/IRTF processes over time.

With collaborative assistance, we hope to iteratively improve SSH3 towards safe production readiness. But we cannot credibly make definitive security claims without evidence of extensive expert cryptographic review and adoption by respected security authorities. Let&#039;s work together to realize SSH3&#039;s possibilities!

## Installing SSH3
You can either download the last [release binaries](https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/releases),
[install it using `go install`](#installing-ssh3-and-ssh3-server-using-go-install) or generate these binaries yourself by compiling the code from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; SSH3 is still experimental and is the fruit of a research work. If you are afraid of deploying publicly a new SSH3 server, you can use the
&gt; [secret path](#-your-ssh3-public-server-can-be-hidden) feature of SSH3 to hide it behing a secret URL.

### Installing ssh3 and ssh3-server using Go install
```bash
go install github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/cmd/...@latest
```



### Compiling SSH3 from source
You need a recent [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/) version to do this.
Downloading the source code and compiling the binaries can be done with the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3    # clone the repo
cd ssh3
go build -o ssh3 cmd/ssh3/main.go                        # build the client
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o ssh3-server cmd/ssh3-server/main.go   # build the server, requires having gcc installed
```

If you have root/sudo privileges and you want to make ssh3 accessible to all you users,
you can then directly copy the binaries to `/usr/bin`:

```bash
cp ssh3 /usr/bin/ &amp;&amp; cp ssh3-server /usr/bin
```

Otherwise, you can simply add the executables to your `PATH` environment variable by adding
the following line at the end of your `.bashrc` or equivalent:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/the/ssh3/directory
```

### Deploying an SSH3 server
Before connecting to your host, you need to deploy an SSH3 server on it. There is currently
no SSH3 daemon, so right now, you will have to run the `ssh3-server` executable in background
using `screen` or a similar utility.


&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; As SSH3 runs on top of HTTP/3, a server needs an X.509 certificate and its corresponding private key. Public certificates can be generated automatically for your public domain name through Let&#039;s Encrypt using the `-generate-public-cert` command-line argument on the server. If you do not want to generate a certificate signed by a real certificate authority or if you don&#039;t have any public domain name, you can generate a self-signed one using the `-generate-selfsigned-cert` command-line argument. Self-signed certificates provide you with similar security guarantees to SSHv2&#039;s host keys mechanism, with the same security issue: you may be vulnerable to machine-in-the-middle attacks during your first connection to your server. Using real certificates signed by public certificate authorities such as Let&#039;s Encrypt avoids this issue.


Here is the usage of the `ssh3-server` executable:

```
Usage of ./ssh3-server:
  -bind string
        the address:port pair to listen to, e.g. 0.0.0.0:443 (default &quot;[::]:443&quot;)
  -cert string
        the filename of the server certificate (or fullchain) (default &quot;./cert.pem&quot;)
  -key string
        the filename of the certificate private key (default &quot;./priv.key&quot;)
  -enable-password-login
        if set, enable password authentication (disabled by default)
  -generate-public-cert value
        Automatically produce and use a valid public certificate usingLet&#039;s Encrypt for the provided domain name. The flag can be used several times to generate several certificates.If certificates have already been generated previously using this flag, they will simply be reused without being regenerated. The public certificates are automatically renewed as long as the server is running. Automatically-generated IP public certificates are not available yet.
  -generate-selfsigned-cert
        if set, generates a self-self-signed cerificate and key that will be stored at the paths indicated by the -cert and -key args (they must not already exist)
  -url-path string
        the secret URL path on which the ssh3 server listens (default &quot;/ssh3-term&quot;)
  -v    verbose mode, if set
  -version
        if set, displays the software version on standard output and exit
```

The following command starts a public SSH3 server on port 443 with a valid Let&#039;s Encrypt public certificate
for domain `my-domain.example.org` and answers to new sessions requests querying the `/ssh3` URL path:

    ssh3-server -generate-public-cert my-domain.example.org -url-path /ssh3

If you don&#039;t have a public domain name (i.e. only an IP address), you can either use an existing certificate
for your IP address using the `-cert` and `-key` arguments or generate a self-signed certificate using the
`-generate-selfsigned-cert` argument.

If you have existing certificates and keys, you can run the server as follows to use them=

    ssh3-server -cert /path/to/cert/or/fullchain -key /path/to/cert/private/key -url-path /ssh3

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Similarly to OpenSSH, the server must be run with root priviledges to log in as other users.

#### Authorized keys and authorized identities
By default, the SSH3 server will look for identities in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `~/.ssh3/authorized_identities` files for each user.
`~/.ssh3/authorized_identities` allows new identities such as OpenID Connect (`oidc`) discussed [below](#openid-connect-authentication-still-experimental).
Popular key types such as `rsa`, `ed25519` and keys in the OpenSSH format can be used.

### Using the SSH3 client
Once you have an SSH3 server running, you can connect to it using the SSH3 client similarly to what
you did with your classical SSHv2 tool.

Here is the usage of the `ssh3` executable:

```
Usage of ssh3:
  -pubkey-for-agent string
        if set, use an agent key whose public key matches the one in the specified path
  -privkey string
        private key file
  -use-password
        if set, do classical password authentication
  -forward-agent
        if set, forwards ssh agent to be used with sshv2 connections on the remote host
  -forward-tcp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -forward-udp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -proxy-jump string
    	if set, performs a proxy jump using the specified remote host as proxy
  -insecure
        if set, skip server certificate verification
  -keylog string
        Write QUIC TLS keys and master secret in the specified keylog file: only for debugging purpose
  -use-oidc string
        if set, force the use of OpenID Connect with the specified issuer url as parameter
  -oidc-config string
        OpenID Connect json config file containing the &quot;client_id&quot; and &quot;client_secret&quot; fields needed for most identity providers
  -do-pkce
        if set, perform PKCE challenge-response with oidc
  -v    if set, enable verbose mode
```

#### Private-key authentication
You can connect to your SSH3 server at my-server.example.org listening on `/my-secret-path` using the private key located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with the following command:

      ssh3 -privkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path

#### Agent-based private key authentication
The SSH3 client works with the OpenSSH agent and uses the classical `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to
communicate with this agent. Similarly to OpenSSH, SSH3 will list the keys provided by the SSH agent
and connect using the first key listen by the agent by default.
If you want to specify a specific key to use with the agent, you can either specify the private key
directly with the `-privkey` argument like above, or specify the corresponding public key using the
`-pubkey-for-agent` argument. This allows you to authenticate in situations where only the agent has
a direct access to the private key but you only have access to the public key.

#### Password-based authentication
While discouraged, you can connect to your server using passwords (if explicitly enabled on the `ssh3-server`)
with the following command:

      ssh3 -use-password username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path

#### Config-based session establishment
`ssh3` parses your OpenSSH config. Currently, it only handles the `Hostname`; `User`, `Port` and `IdentityFile` OpenSSH options.
It also adds new option only used by SSH3, such as `URLPath` or `UDPProxyJump`. `URLPath` allows you to omit the secret URL path in your
SSH3 command. `UDPProxyJump` allows you to perform SSH3 (#proxy-jump)[Proxy Jump] and has the same meaning as the `-proxy-jump` command-line argument.
Let&#039;s say you have the following lines in your OpenSSH config located in `~/.ssh/config` :
```
IgnoreUnknown URLPath
Host my-server
  HostName 192.0.2.0
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  URLPath /my-secret-path
```

Similarly to what OpenSSH does, the following `ssh3` command will connect you to the SSH3 server running on 192.0.2.0 on UDP port 443 using public key authentication with the private key located in `.ssh/id_rsa` :

      ssh3 my-server/my-secret-path

If you do not want a config-based utilization of SSH3, you can read the sections below to see how to use the CLI parameters of `ssh3`.

#### OpenID Connect authentication (still experimental)
This feature allows you to connect using an external identity provider such as the one
of your company or any other provider that implements the OpenID Connect standard, such as Google Identity,
Github or Microsoft Entra. The authentication flow is illustrated in the GIF below.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;resources/figures/ssh3_oidc.gif&quot; width=75%&gt;

*Secure connection without private key using a Google account.*
&lt;/div&gt;

The way it connects to your identity provider is configured in a file named `~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json`.
Below is an example `config.json` file for use with a Google account. This configuration file is an array
and can contain several identity providers configurations.
```json
[
    {
        &quot;issuer_url&quot;: &quot;https://accounts.google.com&quot;,
        &quot;client_id&quot;: &quot;&lt;your_client_id&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;client_secret&quot;: &quot;&lt;your_client_secret&gt;&quot;
    }
]
```
This might change in the future, but currently, to make this feature work with your Google account, you will need to setup a new experimental application in your Google Cloud console and add your email as authorized users.
This will provide you with a `client_id` and a `client_secret` that you can then set in your `~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json`. On the server side, you just have to add the following line in your `~/.ssh3/authorized_identities`:

```
oidc &lt;client_id&gt; https://accounts.google.com &lt;email&gt;
```
We currently consider removing the need of setting the client_id in the `authorized_identities` file in the future.

#### Proxy jump
It is often the case that some SSH hosts can only be accessed through a gateway. SSH3 allows you to perform a Proxy Jump similarly to what is proposed by OpenSSH.
You can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. B and C must both be running a valid SSH3 server. This works by establishing UDP port forwarding on B to forward QUIC packets from A to C.
The connection from A to C is therefore fully end-to-end and B cannot decrypt or alter the SSH3 traffic between A and C.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nix (NUR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Crush is available via [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) in `nur.repos.charmbracelet.crush`.

You can also try out Crush via `nix-shell`:

```bash
# Add the NUR channel.
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/main.tar.gz nur
nix-channel --update

# Get Crush in a Nix shell.
nix-shell -p &#039;(import &lt;nur&gt; { pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}; }).repos.charmbracelet.crush&#039;
```

### NixOS &amp; Home Manager Module Usage via NUR

Crush provides NixOS and Home Manager modules via NUR.
You can use these modules directly in your flake by importing them from NUR. Since it auto detects whether its a home manager or nixos context you can use the import the exact same way :)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nur.url = &quot;github:nix-community/NUR&quot;;
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nur, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
      modules = [
        nur.modules.nixos.default
        nur.repos.charmbracelet.modules.crush
        {
          programs.crush = {
            enable = true;
            settings = {
              providers = {
                openai = {
                  id = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  name = &quot;OpenAI&quot;;
                  base_url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1&quot;;
                  type = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  api_key = &quot;sk-fake123456789abcdef...&quot;;
                  models = [
                    {
                      id = &quot;gpt-4&quot;;
                      name = &quot;GPT-4&quot;;
                    }
                  ];
                };
              };
              lsp = {
                go = { command = &quot;gopls&quot;; enabled = true; };
                nix = { command = &quot;nil&quot;; enabled = true; };
              };
              options = {
                context_paths = [ &quot;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&quot; ];
                tui = { compact_mode = true; };
                debug = false;
              };
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora/RHEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
echo &#039;[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key&#039; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Productivity may increase when using Crush and you may find yourself nerd
&gt; sniped when first using the application. If the symptoms persist, join the
&gt; [Discord][discord] and nerd snipe the rest of us.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, or OpenRouter and just start
Crush. You&#039;ll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

| Environment Variable        | Provider                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`         | Anthropic                                          |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`            | OpenAI                                             |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`        | OpenRouter                                         |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`            | Google Gemini                                      |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`          | Cerebras                                           |
| `HF_TOKEN`                  | Huggingface Inference                              |
| `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`          | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `VERTEXAI_LOCATION`         | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`              | Groq                                               |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`         | AWS Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`     | AWS Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_REGION`                | AWS Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_PROFILE`               | Custom AWS Profile                                 |
| `AWS_REGION`                | AWS Region                                         |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI models                                |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`      | Azure OpenAI models (optional when using Entra ID) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`  | Azure OpenAI models                                |

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Catwalk Badge&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\crush\crush.json`)

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  &quot;this-setting&quot;: { &quot;this&quot;: &quot;that&quot; },
  &quot;that-setting&quot;: [&quot;ceci&quot;, &quot;cela&quot;]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;lsp&quot;: {
    &quot;go&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gopls&quot;,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GOTOOLCHAIN&quot;: &quot;go1.24.5&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;typescript&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;typescript-language-server&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;--stdio&quot;]
    },
    &quot;nix&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nil&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/mcp-server.js&quot;],
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NODE_ENV&quot;: &quot;production&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;$(echo Bearer $EXAMPLE_MCP_TOKEN)&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;streaming-service&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/sse&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;API-Key&quot;: &quot;$(echo $API_KEY)&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don&#039;t want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you&#039;d like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allowed_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;view&quot;,
      &quot;ls&quot;,
      &quot;grep&quot;,
      &quot;edit&quot;,
      &quot;mcp_context7_get-library-doc&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;attribution&quot;: {
      &quot;co_authored_by&quot;: true,
      &quot;generated_with&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;ollama&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ollama&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen3:30b&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;lmstudio&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;LM Studio&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:1234/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don&#039;t forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;deepseek&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deepseek V3&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 0.27,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 0.07,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 64000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;custom-anthropic&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anthropic&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.anthropic.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;extra_headers&quot;: {
        &quot;anthropic-version&quot;: &quot;2023-06-01&quot;
      },
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Claude Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;vertexai&quot;: {
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4@20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VertexAI Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;debug&quot;: true,
    &quot;debug_lsp&quot;: true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_provider_auto_update&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
crush update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
crush update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at crush at build time.
crush update-providers embedded

# For more info:
crush update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Crush records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code ([here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/blob/main/internal/llm/agent/event.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Or by setting the following in your config:

```json
{
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_metrics&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Crush also respects the [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://consoledonottrack.com)
convention which can be enabled via `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

## A Note on Claude Max and GitHub Copilot

Crush only supports model providers through official, compliant APIs. We do not
support or endorse any methods that rely on personal Claude Max and GitHub
Copilot accounts or OAuth workarounds, which violate Anthropic and
Microsoft’s Terms of Service.

We’re committed to building sustainable, trusted integrations with model
providers. If you’re a provider interested in working with us,
[reach out](mailto:vt100@charm.sh).

----

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who&#039;s involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

----

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

## To start developing K8s

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```

For the full story, head over to the [developer&#039;s documentation].

## Support

If you need support, start with the [troubleshooting guide],
and work your way through the process that we&#039;ve outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us
[one way or another][communication].

## 👋 INTRODUCTION

SafeLine is a self-hosted **`WAF(Web Application Firewall)`** to protect your web apps from attacks and exploits.

A web application firewall helps protect web apps by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It typically protects web apps from attacks such as `SQL injection`, `XSS`, `code injection`, `os command injection`, `CRLF injection`, `ldap injection`, `xpath injection`, `RCE`, `XXE`, `SSRF`, `path traversal`, `backdoor`, `bruteforce`, `http-flood`, `bot abused`, among others.

#### 💡 How It Works

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/how-it-works.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;

By deploying a WAF in front of a web application, a shield is placed between the web application and the Internet. While a proxy server protects a client machine’s identity by using an intermediary, a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy, protecting the server from exposure by having clients pass through the WAF before reaching the server.

A WAF protects your web apps by filtering, monitoring, and blocking any malicious HTTP/S traffic traveling to the web application, and prevents any unauthorized data from leaving the app. It does this by adhering to a set of policies that help determine what traffic is malicious and what traffic is safe. Just as a proxy server acts as an intermediary to protect the identity of a client, a WAF operates in similar fashion but acting as a reverse proxy intermediary that protects the web app server from a potentially malicious client.

its core capabilities include:

- Defenses for web attacks
- Proactive bot abused defense 
- HTML &amp; JS code encryption
- IP-based rate limiting
- Web Access Control List

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## BNB Smart Chain

The goal of BNB Smart Chain is to bring programmability and interoperability to BNB Beacon Chain. In order to embrace the existing popular community and advanced technology, it will bring huge benefits by staying compatible with all the existing smart contracts on Ethereum and Ethereum tooling. And to achieve that, the easiest solution is to develop based on go-ethereum fork, as we respect the great work of Ethereum very much.

BNB Smart Chain starts its development based on go-ethereum fork. So you may see many toolings, binaries and also docs are based on Ethereum ones, such as the name &quot;geth&quot;.

[![API Reference](
https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum?tab=doc)
[![Build Test](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/actions/workflows/build-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/actions)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join%20chat-blue.svg)](https://discord.gg/z2VpC455eU)

But from that baseline of EVM compatible, BNB Smart Chain introduces a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.

**The BNB Smart Chain** will be:

- **A self-sovereign blockchain**: Provides security and safety with elected validators.
- **EVM-compatible**: Supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster finality and cheaper transaction fees.
- **Distributed with on-chain governance**: Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community participants. As the native token, BNB will serve as both the gas of smart contract execution and tokens for staking.

More details in [White Paper](https://github.com/bnb-chain/whitepaper/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md).

## Release Types
There are three types of release, each with a clear purpose and version scheme:

- **1.Stable Release**: production-ready builds for the vast majority of users.  Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;`, example: [v1.5.19](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.19).
- **2.Feature Release**: early access to a single feature without affecting the core product. Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;-feature-&lt;FeatureName&gt;`, example: [v1.5.19-feature-SI](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.19-feature-SI).
- **3.Preview Release**: bleeding-edge builds for users who want the latest code. Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;-&lt;Meta&gt;`, Meta values indicate maturity: alpha (experimental), beta (largely complete), rc (release candidate), example: [v1.5.0-alpha](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.0-alpha).

## Key features

### Proof of Staked Authority 
Although Proof-of-Work (PoW) has been approved as a practical mechanism to implement a decentralized network, it is not friendly to the environment and also requires a large size of participants to maintain the security. 

Proof-of-Authority(PoA) provides some defense to 51% attack, with improved efficiency and tolerance to certain levels of Byzantine players (malicious or hacked). 
Meanwhile, the PoA protocol is most criticized for being not as decentralized as PoW, as the validators, i.e. the nodes that take turns to produce blocks, have all the authorities and are prone to corruption and security attacks.

Other blockchains, such as EOS and Cosmos both, introduce different types of Deputy Proof of Stake (DPoS) to allow the token holders to vote and elect the validator set. It increases the decentralization and favors community governance. 

To combine DPoS and PoA for consensus, BNB Smart Chain implement a novel consensus engine called Parlia that:

1. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators.
2. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner, similar to Ethereum&#039;s Clique consensus engine.
3. Validator set are elected in and out based on a staking based governance on BNB Smart Chain.
4. Parlia consensus engine will interact with a set of [system contracts](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/staking/overview/#system-contracts) to achieve liveness slash, revenue distributing and validator set renewing func.

## Native Token

BNB will run on BNB Smart Chain in the same way as ETH runs on Ethereum so that it remains as `native token` for BSC. This means,
BNB will be used to:

1. pay `gas` to deploy or invoke Smart Contract on BSC

## Building the source

Many of the below are the same as or similar to go-ethereum.

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.24 or later) and a C compiler (GCC 5 or higher). You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

If you get such error when running the node with self built binary:
```shell
Caught SIGILL in blst_cgo_init, consult &lt;blst&gt;/bindinds/go/README.md.
```
please try to add the following environment variables and build again:
```shell
export CGO_CFLAGS=&quot;-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__&quot; 
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW=&quot;-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__&quot;
```

## Executables

The bsc project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  `abigen`  | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) page for details.                                                                                               |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   `evm`    | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we&#039;ve enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

The hardware must meet certain requirements to run a full node on mainnet:
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
- IMPORTANT 3 TB(Dec 2023) of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 500 MB/S throughput, read latency &lt;1ms. (if node is started with snap sync, it will need NVMe SSD)
- 16 cores of CPU and 64 GB of memory (RAM)
- Suggest m5zn.6xlarge or r7iz.4xlarge instance type on AWS, c2-standard-16 on Google cloud.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 5 MB/S

The requirement for testnet:
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
- 500G of storage for testnet.
- 4 cores of CPU and 16 gigabytes of memory (RAM).

### Steps to Run a Fullnode

#### 1. Download the pre-build binaries
```shell
# Linux
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_linux |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
mv geth_linux geth
chmod -v u+x geth

# MacOS
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_mac |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
mv geth_macos geth
chmod -v u+x geth
```

#### 2. Download the config files
```shell
//== mainnet
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mainnet |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
unzip mainnet.zip

//== testnet
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep testnet |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
unzip testnet.zip
```

#### 3. Download snapshot
Download latest chaindata snapshot from [here](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-snapshots). Follow the guide to structure your files.

#### 4. Start a full node
```shell
## It will run with Path-Base Storage Scheme by default and enable inline state prune, keeping the latest 90000 blocks&#039; history state.
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --history.transactions 0

## It is recommend to run fullnode with `--tries-verify-mode none` if you want high performance and care little about state consistency.
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --history.transactions 0 --tries-verify-mode none
```

#### 5. Monitor node status

Monitor the log from **./node/bsc.log** by default. When the node has started syncing, should be able to see the following output:
```shell
t=2022-09-08T13:00:27+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=177   mgas=17.317   elapsed=31.131ms    mgasps=556.259  number=21,153,429 hash=0x42e6b54ba7106387f0650defc62c9ace3160b427702dab7bd1c5abb83a32d8db dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
t=2022-09-08T13:00:29+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=251   mgas=39.638   elapsed=68.827ms    mgasps=575.900  number=21,153,430 hash=0xa3397b273b31b013e43487689782f20c03f47525b4cd4107c1715af45a88796e dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
t=2022-09-08T13:00:33+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=197   mgas=19.364   elapsed=34.663ms    mgasps=558.632  number=21,153,431 hash=0x0c7872b698f28cb5c36a8a3e1e315b1d31bda6109b15467a9735a12380e2ad14 dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
```

#### 6. Interact with fullnode
Start up `geth`&#039;s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/javascript-console),
(via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/) 
(note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
as well as `geth`&#039;s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server).
This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
`geth` instance with `geth attach`.

#### 7. More

More details about [running a node](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/developers/node_operators/full_node/) and [becoming a validator](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/validator/create-val/)

*Note: Although some internal protective measures prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should always
use separate accounts for play and real money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you&#039;ll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
BSC network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/),
[`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc), and [BSC&#039;s JSON-RPC API Reference](rpc/json-rpc-api.md)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you&#039;d expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API&#039;s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API&#039;s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You&#039;ll need to use your own programming environments&#039; capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you&#039;ll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
BSC nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

## Running a bootnode

Bootnodes are super-lightweight nodes that are not behind a NAT and are running just discovery protocol. When you start up a node it should log your enode, which is a public identifier that others can use to connect to your node. 

First the bootnode requires a key, which can be created with the following command, which will save a key to boot.key:

```
bootnode -genkey boot.key
```

This key can then be used to generate a bootnode as follows:

```
bootnode -nodekey boot.key -addr :30311 -network bsc
```

The choice of port passed to -addr is arbitrary. 
The bootnode command returns the following logs to the terminal, confirming that it is running:

```
enode://3063d1c9e1b824cfbb7c7b6abafa34faec6bb4e7e06941d218d760acdd7963b274278c5c3e63914bd6d1b58504c59ec5522c56f883baceb8538674b92da48a96@127.0.0.1:0?discport=30311
Note: you&#039;re using cmd/bootnode, a developer tool.
We recommend using a regular node as bootstrap node for production deployments.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## What is Nebula?
Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool with a focus on performance, simplicity and security.
It lets you seamlessly connect computers anywhere in the world. Nebula is portable, and runs on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, and Android.
It can be used to connect a small number of computers, but is also able to connect tens of thousands of computers.

Nebula incorporates a number of existing concepts like encryption, security groups, certificates,
and tunneling.
What makes Nebula different to existing offerings is that it brings all of these ideas together,
resulting in a sum that is greater than its individual parts.

Further documentation can be found [here](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/).

You can read more about Nebula [here](https://medium.com/p/884110a5579).

## Technical Overview

Nebula is a mutually authenticated peer-to-peer software-defined network based on the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/).
Nebula uses certificates to assert a node&#039;s IP address, name, and membership within user-defined groups.
Nebula&#039;s user-defined groups allow for provider agnostic traffic filtering between nodes.
Discovery nodes (aka lighthouses) allow individual peers to find each other and optionally use UDP hole punching to establish connections from behind most firewalls or NATs.
Users can move data between nodes in any number of cloud service providers, datacenters, and endpoints, without needing to maintain a particular addressing scheme.

Nebula uses Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (`ECDH`) key exchange and `AES-256-GCM` in its default configuration.

Nebula was created to provide a mechanism for groups of hosts to communicate securely, even across the internet, while enabling expressive firewall definitions similar in style to cloud security groups.

## Getting started (quickly)

To set up a Nebula network, you&#039;ll need:

#### 1. The [Nebula binaries](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/releases) or [Distribution Packages](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula#distribution-packages) for your specific platform. Specifically you&#039;ll need `nebula-cert` and the specific nebula binary for each platform you use.

#### 2. (Optional, but you really should..) At least one discovery node with a routable IP address, which we call a lighthouse.

Nebula lighthouses allow nodes to find each other, anywhere in the world. A lighthouse is the only node in a Nebula network whose IP should not change. Running a lighthouse requires very few compute resources, and you can easily use the least expensive option from a cloud hosting provider. If you&#039;re not sure which provider to use, a number of us have used $6/mo [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplets as lighthouses.

Once you have launched an instance, ensure that Nebula udp traffic (default port udp/4242) can reach it over the internet.

#### 3. A Nebula certificate authority, which will be the root of trust for a particular Nebula network.

```sh
./nebula-cert ca -name &quot;Myorganization, Inc&quot;
```

This will create files named `ca.key` and `ca.cert` in the current directory. The `ca.key` file is the most sensitive file you&#039;ll create, because it is the key used to sign the certificates for individual nebula nodes/hosts. Please store this file somewhere safe, preferably with strong encryption.

**Be aware!** By default, certificate authorities have a 1-year lifetime before expiration. See [this guide](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/guides/rotating-certificate-authority/) for details on rotating a CA.

#### 4. Nebula host keys and certificates generated from that certificate authority

This assumes you have four nodes, named lighthouse1, laptop, server1, host3. You can name the nodes any way you&#039;d like, including FQDN. You&#039;ll also need to choose IP addresses and the associated subnet. In this example, we are creating a nebula network that will use 192.168.100.x/24 as its network range. This example also demonstrates nebula groups, which can later be used to define traffic rules in a nebula network.
```sh
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;lighthouse1&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.1/24&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;laptop&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.2/24&quot; -groups &quot;laptop,home,ssh&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;server1&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.9/24&quot; -groups &quot;servers&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;host3&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.10/24&quot;
```

By default, host certificates will expire 1 second before the CA expires. Use the `-duration` flag to specify a shorter lifetime.

#### 5. Configuration files for each host

Download a copy of the nebula [example configuration](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/blob/master/examples/config.yml).

* On the lighthouse node, you&#039;ll need to ensure `am_lighthouse: true` is set.

* On the individual hosts, ensure the lighthouse is defined properly in the `static_host_map` section, and is added to the lighthouse `hosts` section.


#### 6. Copy nebula credentials, configuration, and binaries to each host

For each host, copy the nebula binary to the host, along with `config.yml` from step 5, and the files `ca.crt`, `{host}.crt`, and `{host}.key` from step 4.

**DO NOT COPY `ca.key` TO INDIVIDUAL NODES.**

#### 7. Run nebula on each host

```sh
./nebula -config /path/to/config.yml
```

For more detailed instructions, [find the full documentation here](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/).

## Building Nebula from source

Make sure you have [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed and clone this repo. Change to the nebula directory.

To build nebula for all platforms:
`make all`

To build nebula for a specific platform (ex, Windows):
`make bin-windows`

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for more details on build targets

## Curve P256 and BoringCrypto

The default curve used for cryptographic handshakes and signatures is Curve25519. This is the recommended setting for most users. If your deployment has certain compliance requirements, you have the option of creating your CA using `nebula-cert ca -curve P256` to use NIST Curve P256. The CA will then sign certificates using ECDSA P256, and any hosts using these certificates will use P256 for ECDH handshakes.

In addition, Nebula can be built using the [BoringCrypto GOEXPERIMENT](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.20/src/crypto/internal/boring/README.md) by running either of the following make targets:

```sh
make bin-boringcrypto
make release-boringcrypto
```

This is not the recommended default deployment, but may be useful based on your compliance requirements.

## Installation

PG Back Web is available as a Docker image. You just need to set 3 environment
variables and you&#039;re good to go!

Here&#039;s an example of how you can run PG Back Web with Docker Compose, feel free
to adapt it to your needs:

```yaml
services:
  pgbackweb:
    image: eduardolat/pgbackweb:latest
    ports:
      - &quot;8085:8085&quot; # Access the web interface at http://localhost:8085
    volumes:
      - ./backups:/backups # If you only use S3 destinations, you don&#039;t need this volume
    environment:
      PBW_ENCRYPTION_KEY: &quot;my_secret_key&quot; # Change this to a strong key
      PBW_POSTGRES_CONN_STRING: &quot;postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/pgbackweb?sslmode=disable&quot;
      TZ: &quot;America/Guatemala&quot; # Set your timezone, optional
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy

  postgres:
    image: postgres:17
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: pgbackweb
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - &quot;5432:5432&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: [&quot;CMD-SHELL&quot;, &quot;pg_isready -U postgres&quot;]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
```

You can watch [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf7SLrSO8sw)
to see how easy it is to set up PG Back Web.

## Configuration

You only need to configure the following environment variables:

- `PBW_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Your encryption key. Generate a strong one and store it
  in a safe place, as PG Back Web uses it to encrypt sensitive data.

- `PBW_POSTGRES_CONN_STRING`: The connection string for the PostgreSQL database
  that will store PG Back Web data.

- `PBW_LISTEN_HOST`: Host for the server to listen on, default 0.0.0.0
  (optional)

- `PBW_LISTEN_PORT`: Port for the server to listen on, default 8085 (optional)

- `TZ`: Your
  [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List)
  (optional). Default is `UTC`. This impacts logging, backup filenames and
  default timezone in the web interface.

## Screenshot

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduardolat/pgbackweb/main/assets/screenshot.png&quot; /&gt;

## Reset password

You can reset your PG Back Web password by running the following command in the
server where PG Back Web is running:

```bash
docker exec -it &lt;container_name_or_id&gt; sh -c change-password
```

You should replace `&lt;container_name_or_id&gt;` with the name or ID of the PG Back
Web container, then just follow the instructions.

# Please see [Our Documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for more in-depth installation etc.

kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container &quot;nodes&quot;.
kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

If you have [go] 1.16+ and [docker], [podman] or [nerdctl] installed `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.30.0 &amp;&amp; kind create cluster` is all you need!

![](site/static/images/kind-create-cluster.png)

kind consists of:
- Go [packages][packages] implementing [cluster creation][cluster package], [image build][build package], etc.
- A command line interface ([`kind`][kind cli]) built on these packages.
- Docker [image(s)][images] written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc.
- [`kubetest`][kubetest] integration also built on these packages (WIP)

kind bootstraps each &quot;node&quot; with [kubeadm][kubeadm]. For more details see [the design documentation][design doc].

**NOTE**: kind is still a work in progress, see the [1.0 roadmap].

## Installation and usage

For a complete [install guide] see [the documentation here][install guide].

You can install kind with `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.30.0`.

**NOTE**: please use the latest go to do this. KIND is developed with the latest stable go, see [`.go-version`](./.go-version) for the exact version we&#039;re using.

This will put `kind` in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. If you encounter the error
`kind: command not found` after installation then you may need to either add that directory to your `$PATH` as
shown [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) or do a manual installation by cloning the repo and run
`make build` from the repository.

Without installing go, kind can be built reproducibly with docker using `make build`.

Stable binaries are also available on the [releases] page. Stable releases are
generally recommended for CI usage in particular.
To install, download the binary for your platform from &quot;Assets&quot; and place this
into your `$PATH`:

On Linux:

```console
# For AMD64 / x86_64
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] &amp;&amp; curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-$(uname)-amd64
# For ARM64
[ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] &amp;&amp; curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-$(uname)-arm64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

On macOS via Homebrew:

```console
brew install kind
```

On macOS via MacPorts:

```console
sudo port selfupdate &amp;&amp; sudo port install kind
```

On macOS via Bash:

```console
# For Intel Macs
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] &amp;&amp; curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-darwin-amd64
# For M1 / ARM Macs
[ $(uname -m) = arm64 ] &amp;&amp; curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ./kind
mv ./kind /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind
```

On Windows:

```powershell
curl.exe -Lo kind-windows-amd64.exe https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-windows-amd64
Move-Item .\kind-windows-amd64.exe c:\some-dir-in-your-PATH\kind.exe

# OR via Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/packages/kind)
choco install kind
```

To use kind, you will need to [install docker].
Once you have docker running you can create a cluster with:

```console
kind create cluster
```

To delete your cluster use:

```console
kind delete cluster
```

&lt;!--TODO(bentheelder): improve this part of the guide--&gt;
To create a cluster from Kubernetes source:
- ensure that Kubernetes is cloned in `$(go env GOPATH)/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`
- build a node image and create a cluster with:
```console
kind build node-image
kind create cluster --image kindest/node:latest
```

Multi-node clusters and other advanced features may be configured with a config
file, for more usage see [the docs][user guide] or run `kind [command] --help`

            <h2>README</h2><pre>Testify - Thou Shalt Write Tests
================================

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Testify is being maintained at v1, no breaking changes will be accepted in this repo.  
&gt; [See discussion about v2](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/discussions/1560).

[![Build Status](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/stretchr/testify)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/stretchr/testify) [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/stretchr/testify)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify)

Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.

Features include:

  * [Easy assertions](#assert-package)
  * [Mocking](#mock-package)
  * [Testing suite interfaces and functions](#suite-package)

Get started:

  * Install testify with [one line of code](#installation), or [update it with another](#staying-up-to-date)
  * For an introduction to writing test code in Go, see https://go.dev/doc/code#Testing
  * Check out the API Documentation https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify
  * Use [testifylint](https://github.com/Antonboom/testifylint) (via [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)) to avoid common mistakes
  * A little about [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

[`assert`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `assert` package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

  * Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
  * Allows for very readable code
  * Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

See it in action:

```go
package yours

import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	// assert equality
	assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, &quot;they should be equal&quot;)

	// assert inequality
	assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, &quot;they should not be equal&quot;)

	// assert for nil (good for errors)
	assert.Nil(t, object)

	// assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
	if assert.NotNil(t, object) {
		// now we know that object isn&#039;t nil, we are safe to make
		// further assertions without causing any errors
		assert.Equal(t, &quot;Something&quot;, object.Value)
	}
}
```

  * Every assert func takes the `testing.T` object as the first argument.  This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.
  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	assert := assert.New(t)

	// assert equality
	assert.Equal(123, 123, &quot;they should be equal&quot;)

	// assert inequality
	assert.NotEqual(123, 456, &quot;they should not be equal&quot;)

	// assert for nil (good for errors)
	assert.Nil(object)

	// assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
	if assert.NotNil(object) {
		// now we know that object isn&#039;t nil, we are safe to make
		// further assertions without causing any errors
		assert.Equal(&quot;Something&quot;, object.Value)
	}
}
```

[`require`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/require &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.
These functions must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function, not from other goroutines created during the test.
Otherwise race conditions may occur.

See [t.FailNow](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.FailNow) for details.

[`mock`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.

An example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can set up expectations (testify) and assert that they indeed happened:

```go
package yours

import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/mock&quot;
)

/*
  Test objects
*/

// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface
// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.
type MyMockedObject struct {
	mock.Mock
}

// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface
// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.
//
// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this
// is a mocked object - we&#039;re just going to stub it out.
//
// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.
func (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {
	args := m.Called(number)
	return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)
}

/*
  Actual test functions
*/

// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	// create an instance of our test object
	testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

	// set up expectations
	testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, 123).Return(true, nil)

	// call the code we are testing
	targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

	// assert that the expectations were met
	testObj.AssertExpectations(t)
}

// TestSomethingWithPlaceholder is a second example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
// This time using a placeholder. Placeholders might be used when the
// data being passed in is normally dynamically generated and cannot be
// predicted beforehand (eg. containing hashes that are time sensitive)
func TestSomethingWithPlaceholder(t *testing.T) {
	// create an instance of our test object
	testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

	// set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list
	testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)

	// call the code we are testing
	targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

	// assert that the expectations were met
	testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

}

// TestSomethingElse2 is a third example that shows how you can use
// the Unset method to cleanup handlers and then add new ones.
func TestSomethingElse2(t *testing.T) {
	// create an instance of our test object
	testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

	// set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list
	mockCall := testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)

	// call the code we are testing
	targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

	// assert that the expectations were met
	testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

	// remove the handler now so we can add another one that takes precedence
	mockCall.Unset()

	// return false now instead of true
	testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(false, nil)

	testObj.AssertExpectations(t)
}
```

For more information on how to write mock code, check out the [API documentation for the `mock` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock).

You can use the [mockery tool](https://vektra.github.io/mockery/latest/) to autogenerate the mock code against an interface as well, making using mocks much quicker.

[`suite`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The suite package does not support parallel tests. See [#934](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/issues/934).

The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object-oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with &#039;go test&#039; as per normal.

An example suite is shown below:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/suite&quot;
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including a T() method which
// returns the current testing context
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
	suite.Suite
	VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
	suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with &quot;Test&quot; are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
	assert.Equal(suite.T(), 5, suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive)
}

// In order for &#039;go test&#039; to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
	suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

For more information on writing suites, check out the [API documentation for the `suite` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite).

`Suite` object has assertion methods:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
	&quot;testing&quot;

	&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/suite&quot;
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including assertion methods.
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
	suite.Suite
	VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
	suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with &quot;Test&quot; are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
	suite.Equal(suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
}

// In order for &#039;go test&#039; to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
	suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

## What is Higress?

Higress is a cloud-native API gateway based on Istio and Envoy, which can be extended with Wasm plugins written in Go/Rust/JS. It provides dozens of ready-to-use general-purpose plugins and an out-of-the-box console (try the [demo here](http://demo.higress.io/)).

### Core Use Cases

Higress&#039;s AI gateway capabilities support all [mainstream model providers](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/tree/main/plugins/wasm-go/extensions/ai-proxy/provider) both domestic and international. It also supports hosting MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers through its plugin mechanism, enabling AI Agents to easily call various tools and services. With the [openapi-to-mcp tool](https://github.com/higress-group/openapi-to-mcpserver), you can quickly convert OpenAPI specifications into remote MCP servers for hosting. Higress provides unified management for both LLM API and MCP API. 

**🌟 Try it now at [https://mcp.higress.ai/](https://mcp.higress.ai/)** to experience Higress-hosted Remote MCP Servers firsthand:

### Enterprise Adoption

Higress was born within Alibaba to solve the issues of Tengine reload affecting long-connection services and insufficient load balancing capabilities for gRPC/Dubbo. Within Alibaba Cloud, Higress&#039;s AI gateway capabilities support core AI applications such as Tongyi Bailian model studio, machine learning PAI platform, and other critical AI services. Alibaba Cloud has built its cloud-native API gateway product based on Higress, providing 99.99% gateway high availability guarantee service capabilities for a large number of enterprise customers.

## Quick Start

Higress can be started with just Docker, making it convenient for individual developers to set up locally for learning or for building simple sites:

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir higress; cd higress
# Start higress, configuration files will be written to the working directory
docker run -d --rm --name higress-ai -v ${PWD}:/data \
        -p 8001:8001 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443  \
        higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/higress/all-in-one:latest
```

Port descriptions:

- Port 8001: Higress UI console entry
- Port 8080: Gateway HTTP protocol entry
- Port 8443: Gateway HTTPS protocol entry

&gt; All Higress Docker images use Higress&#039;s own image repository and are not affected by Docker Hub rate limits.
&gt; In addition, the submission and updates of the images are protected by a security scanning mechanism (powered by Alibaba Cloud ACR), making them very secure for use in production environments.
&gt; 
&gt; If you experience a timeout when pulling image from `higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com`, you can try replacing it with the following docker registry mirror source:
&gt; 
&gt; **Southeast Asia**: `higress-registry.ap-southeast-7.cr.aliyuncs.com`

For other installation methods such as Helm deployment under K8s, please refer to the official [Quick Start documentation](https://higress.io/en-us/docs/user/quickstart).

[![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/minio/minio.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20V3-blue)](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE)

[![MinIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/.github/logo.svg?sanitize=true)](https://min.io)

MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage solution released under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license. Designed for speed and scalability, it powers AI/ML, analytics, and data-intensive workloads with industry-leading performance.

🔹 S3 API Compatible – Seamless integration with existing S3 tools
🔹 Built for AI &amp; Analytics – Optimized for large-scale data pipelines
🔹 High Performance – Ideal for demanding storage workloads.

AI storage documentation  (https://min.io/solutions/object-storage-for-ai).

This README provides quickstart instructions on running MinIO on bare metal hardware, including container-based installations. For Kubernetes environments, use the [MinIO Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator/blob/master/README.md).

## Container Installation

Use the following commands to run a standalone MinIO server as a container.

Standalone MinIO servers are best suited for early development and evaluation. Certain features such as versioning, object locking, and bucket replication
require distributed deploying MinIO with Erasure Coding. For extended development and production, deploy MinIO with Erasure Coding enabled - specifically,
with a *minimum* of 4 drives per MinIO server. See [MinIO Erasure Code Overview](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html)
for more complete documentation.

### Stable

Run the following command to run the latest stable image of MinIO as a container using an ephemeral data volume:

```sh
podman run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address &quot;:9001&quot;
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded
object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the
root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool. See
[Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool. For application developers,
see &lt;https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/developers/minio-drivers.html&gt; to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To deploy MinIO on with persistent storage, you must map local persistent directories from the host OS to the container using the `podman -v` option.
&gt; For example, `-v /mnt/data:/data` maps the host OS drive at `/mnt/data` to `/data` on the container.

## macOS

Use the following commands to run a standalone MinIO server on macOS.

Standalone MinIO servers are best suited for early development and evaluation. Certain features such as versioning, object locking, and bucket replication require distributed deploying MinIO with Erasure Coding. For extended development and production, deploy MinIO with Erasure Coding enabled - specifically, with a *minimum* of 4 drives per MinIO server. See [MinIO Erasure Code Overview](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html) for more complete documentation.

### Homebrew (recommended)

Run the following command to install the latest stable MinIO package using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Replace ``/data`` with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data.

```sh
brew install minio/stable/minio
minio server /data
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you previously installed minio using `brew install minio` then it is recommended that you reinstall minio from `minio/stable/minio` official repo instead.

```sh
brew uninstall minio
brew install minio/stable/minio
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool. See [Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool. For application developers, see &lt;https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/developers/minio-drivers.html/&gt; to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.

### Binary Download

Use the following command to download and run a standalone MinIO server on macOS. Replace ``/data`` with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data.

```sh
wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/darwin-amd64/minio
chmod +x minio
./minio server /data
```

## GNU/Linux

Use the following command to run a standalone MinIO server on Linux hosts running 64-bit Intel/AMD architectures. Replace ``/data`` with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data.

```sh
wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
chmod +x minio
./minio server /data
```

The following table lists supported architectures. Replace the `wget` URL with the architecture for your Linux host.

| Architecture                   | URL                                                        |
| --------                       | ------                                                     |

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Standalone MinIO servers are best suited for early development and evaluation. Certain features such as versioning, object locking, and bucket replication require distributed deploying MinIO with Erasure Coding. For extended development and production, deploy MinIO with Erasure Coding enabled - specifically, with a *minimum* of 4 drives per MinIO server. See [MinIO Erasure Code Overview](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html) for more complete documentation.

## Microsoft Windows

To run MinIO on 64-bit Windows hosts, download the MinIO executable from the following URL:

```sh
https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/windows-amd64/minio.exe
```

Use the following command to run a standalone MinIO server on the Windows host. Replace ``D:\`` with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data. You must change the terminal or powershell directory to the location of the ``minio.exe`` executable, *or* add the path to that directory to the system ``$PATH``:

```sh
minio.exe server D:\
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.

## Install from Source

Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source. Source installation is only intended for developers and advanced users. If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow [How to install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install). Minimum version required is [go1.24](https://golang.org/dl/#stable)

```sh
go install github.com/minio/minio@latest
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

MinIO strongly recommends *against* using compiled-from-source MinIO servers for production environments.

## Deployment Recommendations

### Allow port access for Firewalls

By default MinIO uses the port 9000 to listen for incoming connections. If your platform blocks the port by default, you may need to enable access to the port.

### ufw

For hosts with ufw enabled (Debian based distros), you can use `ufw` command to allow traffic to specific ports. Use below command to allow access to port 9000

```sh
ufw allow 9000
```

Below command enables all incoming traffic to ports ranging from 9000 to 9010.

```sh
ufw allow 9000:9010/tcp
```

### firewall-cmd

For hosts with firewall-cmd enabled (CentOS), you can use `firewall-cmd` command to allow traffic to specific ports. Use below commands to allow access to port 9000

```sh
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

This command gets the active zone(s). Now, apply port rules to the relevant zones returned above. For example if the zone is `public`, use

```sh
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9000/tcp --permanent
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; `permanent` makes sure the rules are persistent across firewall start, restart or reload. Finally reload the firewall for changes to take effect.

```sh
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### iptables

For hosts with iptables enabled (RHEL, CentOS, etc), you can use `iptables` command to enable all traffic coming to specific ports. Use below command to allow
access to port 9000

```sh
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT
service iptables restart
```

Below command enables all incoming traffic to ports ranging from 9000 to 9010.

```sh
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9000:9010 -j ACCEPT
service iptables restart
```

## Test MinIO Connectivity

### Test using MinIO Console

MinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser. Point your web browser to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; to ensure your server has started successfully.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use `--console-address` to pick a specific interface and port.

### Things to consider

MinIO redirects browser access requests to the configured server port (i.e. `127.0.0.1:9000`) to the configured Console port. MinIO uses the hostname or IP address specified in the request when building the redirect URL. The URL and port *must* be accessible by the client for the redirection to work.

For deployments behind a load balancer, proxy, or ingress rule where the MinIO host IP address or port is not public, use the `MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL` environment variable to specify the external hostname for the redirect. The LB/Proxy must have rules for directing traffic to the Console port specifically.

For example, consider a MinIO deployment behind a proxy `https://minio.example.net`, `https://console.minio.example.net` with rules for forwarding traffic on port :9000 and :9001 to MinIO and the MinIO Console respectively on the internal network. Set `MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL` to `https://console.minio.example.net` to ensure the browser receives a valid reachable URL.

## Test using MinIO Client `mc`

`mc` provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services. Follow the MinIO Client [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart) for further instructions.

## Upgrading MinIO

Upgrades require zero downtime in MinIO, all upgrades are non-disruptive, all transactions on MinIO are atomic. So upgrading all the servers simultaneously is the recommended way to upgrade MinIO.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; requires internet access to update directly from &lt;https://dl.min.io&gt;, optionally you can host any mirrors at &lt;https://my-artifactory.example.com/minio/&gt;

- For deployments that installed the MinIO server binary by hand, use [`mc admin update`](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc-admin/mc-admin-update.html)

```sh
mc admin update &lt;minio alias, e.g., myminio&gt;
```

- For deployments without external internet access (e.g. airgapped environments), download the binary from &lt;https://dl.min.io&gt; and replace the existing MinIO binary let&#039;s say for example `/opt/bin/minio`, apply executable permissions `chmod +x /opt/bin/minio` and proceed to perform `mc admin service restart alias/`.

- For installations using Systemd MinIO service, upgrade via RPM/DEB packages **parallelly** on all servers or replace the binary lets say `/opt/bin/minio` on all nodes, apply executable permissions `chmod +x /opt/bin/minio` and process to perform `mc admin service restart alias/`.

### Upgrade Checklist

- Test all upgrades in a lower environment (DEV, QA, UAT) before applying to production. Performing blind upgrades in production environments carries significant risk.
- Read the release notes for MinIO *before* performing any upgrade, there is no forced requirement to upgrade to latest release upon every release. Some release may not be relevant to your setup, avoid upgrading production environments unnecessarily.
- If you plan to use `mc admin update`, MinIO process must have write access to the parent directory where the binary is present on the host system.
- `mc admin update` is not supported and should be avoided in kubernetes/container environments, please upgrade containers by upgrading relevant container images.
- **We do not recommend upgrading one MinIO server at a time, the product is designed to support parallel upgrades please follow our recommended guidelines.**

## Ballad of asdf

&gt; Once upon a time there was a programming language&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; There were many versions of it&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; So people wrote a version manager for it&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; To switch between versions for projects&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Different, old, new.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there came more programming languages&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; So there came more version managers&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; And many commands for them
&gt; 
&gt; I installed a lot of them&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; I learnt a lot of commands
&gt; 
&gt; Then I said, just one more version manager&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Which I will write instead
&gt; 
&gt; So, there came another version manager&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; **asdf version manager** - &lt;https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; A version manager so extendable&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; for which anyone can create a plugin&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; To support their favourite language&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; No more installing more version managers&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Or learning more commands

# Infrastructure as Code in any Programming Language

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pulumi.com/images/get-started.svg?&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

**Pulumi Infrastructure as Code** is the easiest way to build and deploy infrastructure, of any architecture and on any cloud, using programming languages that you already know and love. Code and ship infrastructure faster with your favorite languages and tools, and embed IaC anywhere with [Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/using-pulumi/automation-api/).

Simply write code in your favorite language and Pulumi automatically provisions and manages your resources on
[AWS](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/aws/),
[Azure](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/azure/),
[Google Cloud Platform](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/gcp/), 
[Kubernetes](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/kubernetes/), and [120+ providers](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/) using an
[infrastructure-as-code](https://www.pulumi.com/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) approach.
Skip the YAML, and use standard language features like loops, functions, classes,
and package management that you already know and love.

For example, create three web servers:

```typescript
const aws = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;);
const sg = new aws.ec2.SecurityGroup(&quot;web-sg&quot;, {
    ingress: [{ protocol: &quot;tcp&quot;, fromPort: 80, toPort: 80, cidrBlocks: [&quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot;] }],
});
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    new aws.ec2.Instance(`web-${i}`, {
        ami: &quot;ami-7172b611&quot;,
        instanceType: &quot;t2.micro&quot;,
        vpcSecurityGroupIds: [sg.id],
        userData: `#!/bin/bash
            echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot; &gt; index.html
            nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &amp;`,
    });
}
```

Or a simple serverless timer that archives Hacker News every day at 8:30AM:

```typescript
const aws = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;);

const snapshots = new aws.dynamodb.Table(&quot;snapshots&quot;, {
    attributes: [{ name: &quot;id&quot;, type: &quot;S&quot;, }],
    hashKey: &quot;id&quot;, billingMode: &quot;PAY_PER_REQUEST&quot;,
});

aws.cloudwatch.onSchedule(&quot;daily-yc-snapshot&quot;, &quot;cron(30 8 * * ? *)&quot;, () =&gt; {
    require(&quot;https&quot;).get(&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;, res =&gt; {
        let content = &quot;&quot;;
        res.setEncoding(&quot;utf8&quot;);
        res.on(&quot;data&quot;, chunk =&gt; content += chunk);
        res.on(&quot;end&quot;, () =&gt; new aws.sdk.DynamoDB.DocumentClient().put({
            TableName: snapshots.name.get(),
            Item: { date: Date.now(), content },
        }).promise());
    }).end();
});
```

Many examples are available spanning containers, serverless, and infrastructure in
[pulumi/examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples).

Pulumi is open source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/LICENSE), supports many languages and clouds, and is easy to extend.  This
repo contains the `pulumi` CLI, language SDKs, and core Pulumi engine, and individual libraries are in their own repos.

## &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Getting Started

[![Watch the video](/youtube_preview_image.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f8KF6UGN7g)

See the [Get Started](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/) guide to quickly get started with
Pulumi on your platform and cloud of choice.

Otherwise, the following steps demonstrate how to deploy your first Pulumi program, using AWS
Serverless Lambdas, in minutes:

1. **Install**:

    To install the latest Pulumi release, run the following (see full
    [installation instructions](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/) for additional installation options):

    ```bash
    $ curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com/ | sh
    ```

2. **Create a Project**:

    After installing, you can get started with the `pulumi new` command:

    ```bash
    $ mkdir pulumi-demo &amp;&amp; cd pulumi-demo
    $ pulumi new hello-aws-javascript
    ```

    The `new` command offers templates for all languages and clouds.  Run it without an argument and it&#039;ll prompt
    you with available projects.  This command created an AWS Serverless Lambda project written in JavaScript.

3. **Deploy to the Cloud**:

    Run `pulumi up` to get your code to the cloud:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    ```

    This makes all cloud resources needed to run your code.  Simply make edits to your project, and subsequent
    `pulumi up`s will compute the minimal diff to deploy your changes.

4. **Use Your Program**:

    Now that your code is deployed, you can interact with it.  In the above example, we can curl the endpoint:

    ```bash
    $ curl $(pulumi stack output url)
    ```

5. **Access the Logs**:

    If you&#039;re using containers or functions, Pulumi&#039;s unified logging command will show all of your logs:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi logs -f
    ```

6. **Destroy your Resources**:

    After you&#039;re done, you can remove all resources created by your program:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi destroy -y
    ```

To learn more, head over to [pulumi.com](https://pulumi.com/) for much more information, including
[tutorials](https://www.pulumi.com/tutorials/), [examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples), and
details of the core Pulumi CLI and [programming model concepts](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/).

[![Go Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/go%20report-A%2B-brightgreen.svg)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/rivo/tview)

This Go package provides commonly used components for terminal based user interfaces.

![Screenshot](tview.gif)

Among these components are:

- __Input forms__ (including __text input__, __selections__, __checkboxes__, and __buttons__)
- Navigable multi-color __text views__
- Editable multi-line __text areas__
- Sophisticated navigable __table views__
- Flexible __tree views__
- Selectable __lists__
- __Images__
- __Grid__, __Flexbox__ and __page layouts__
- Modal __message windows__
- An __application__ wrapper

They come with lots of customization options and can be easily extended to fit your needs.

## Usage

To add this package to your project:

```bash
go get github.com/rivo/tview@master
```

## Hello World

This basic example creates a box titled &quot;Hello, World!&quot; and displays it in your terminal:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;github.com/rivo/tview&quot;
)

func main() {
	box := tview.NewBox().SetBorder(true).SetTitle(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
	if err := tview.NewApplication().SetRoot(box, true).Run(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

Check out the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/rivo/tview/wiki) for more examples along with screenshots. Or try the examples in the &quot;demos&quot; subdirectory.

## Backwards-Compatibility

I try really hard to keep this project backwards compatible. Your software should not break when you upgrade `tview`. But this also means that some of its shortcomings that were present in the initial versions will remain. Having said that, backwards compatibility may still break when:

- a new version of an imported package (most likely [`tcell`](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell)) changes in such a way that forces me to make changes in `tview` as well,
- I fix something that I consider a bug, rather than a feature, something that does not work as originally intended,
- I make changes to &quot;internal&quot; interfaces such as [`Primitive`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rivo/tview#Primitive). You shouldn&#039;t need these interfaces unless you&#039;re writing your own primitives for `tview`. (Yes, I realize these are public interfaces. This has advantages as well as disadvantages. For the time being, it is what it is.)
