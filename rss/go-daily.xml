&lt;br&gt;

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Vault Logo&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/f22d202cde2018f9455dec755118a9b84586e082/Vault_PrimaryLogo_Black.png&quot;&gt;

Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.

The key features of Vault are:

* **Secure Secret Storage**: Vault can store arbitrary key/value pairs. Vault encrypts data before writing it to persistent
  storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn&#039;t enough to access
  your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io),
  and more.

* **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some
  systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application
  needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault
  will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After
  creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them
  after the lease is up.

* **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing
  it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and
  developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without
  having to design their own encryption methods.

* **Leasing and Renewal**: Vault associates a **lease** with each secret.
  At the end of the lease, Vault automatically revokes the
  secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.

* **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault
  can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example,
  all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.
  Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the
  case of an intrusion.

Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams
-------------------------------

Documentation is available on the [Vault website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs).

If you&#039;re new to Vault and want to get started with security automation, please
check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/getting-started)
on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault)
to continue your learning.

For examples of how to interact with Vault from inside your application in different programming languages, see the [vault-examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-examples) repo. An out-of-the-box [sample application](https://github.com/hashicorp/hello-vault-go) is also available.

Show off your Vault knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the
[certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/#hashicorp-certified-vault-associate)
for information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/certification)
on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform.

Developing Vault
--------------------

If you wish to work on Vault itself or any of its built-in systems, you&#039;ll
first need [Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.

For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a
[GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), then setting the 
[GOBIN](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables) variable to `$GOPATH/bin`. 
Ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your path as some distributions bundle the old version 
of build tools. 

Next, clone this repository. Vault uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules),
so it is recommended that you clone the repository ***outside*** of the GOPATH.
You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:

```sh
$ make bootstrap
...
```

To compile a development version of Vault, run `make` or `make dev`. This will
put the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make dev
...
$ bin/vault
...
```

To compile a development version of Vault with the UI, run `make static-dist dev-ui`. This will
put the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/vault
...
```

To run tests, type `make test`. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If
this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!

```sh
$ make test
...
```

If you&#039;re developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that
package by specifying the `TEST` variable. For example below, only
`vault` package tests will be run.

```sh
$ make test TEST=./vault
...
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like `could not read Username for &#039;https://github.com&#039;` you may need to adjust your git config like so:

```sh
$ git config --global --add url.&quot;git@github.com:&quot;.insteadOf &quot;https://github.com/&quot;
```


### Importing Vault

This repository publishes two libraries that may be imported by other projects:
`github.com/hashicorp/vault/api` and `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk`.

Note that this repository also contains Vault (the product), and as with most Go
projects, Vault uses Go modules to manage its dependencies. The mechanism to do
that is the [go.mod](./go.mod) file. As it happens, the presence of that file
also makes it theoretically possible to import Vault as a dependency into other
projects. Some other projects have made a practice of doing so in order to take
advantage of testing tooling that was developed for testing Vault itself. This
is not, and has never been, a supported way to use the Vault project. We aren&#039;t 
likely to fix bugs relating to failure to import `github.com/hashicorp/vault` 
into your project.

See also the section &quot;Docker-based tests&quot; below.

### Acceptance Tests

Vault has comprehensive [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)
covering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.

If you&#039;re working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to
verify it is functioning (and also hasn&#039;t broken anything else), we recommend
running the acceptance tests.

**Warning:** The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify *real resources*, which
may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically
possible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,
please run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least,
we recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend
you&#039;re testing.

To run the acceptance tests, invoke `make testacc`:

```sh
$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul
...
```

The `TEST` variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the
backend is. The `TESTARGS` variable is recommended to filter down to a specific
resource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very
long time.

Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for
things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell
you what to set, so it is not documented here.

For more information on Vault Enterprise features, visit the [Vault Enterprise site](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=github-vault-enterprise).

### Docker-based Tests

We have created an experimental new testing mechanism inspired by NewTestCluster.
An example of how to use it:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;hashicorp/vault&quot;, // or &quot;hashicorp/vault-enterprise&quot;
    ImageTag:    &quot;latest&quot;,
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
  
  client := cluster.Nodes()[0].APIClient()
  _, err := client.Logical().Read(&quot;sys/storage/raft/configuration&quot;)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Or for Enterprise:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;hashicorp/vault-enterprise&quot;,
    ImageTag:  &quot;latest&quot;,
	VaultLicense: licenseString, // not a path, the actual license bytes
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

Here is a more realistic example of how we use it in practice.  DefaultOptions uses 
`hashicorp/vault`:`latest` as the repo and tag, but it also looks at the environment
variable VAULT_BINARY. If populated, it will copy the local file referenced by
VAULT_BINARY into the container. This is useful when testing local changes.

Instead of setting the VaultLicense option, you can set the VAULT_LICENSE_CI environment
variable, which is better than committing a license to version control.

Optionally you can set COMMIT_SHA, which will be appended to the image name we
build as a debugging convenience.

```go
func Test_Custom_Build_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

There are a variety of helpers in the `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster`
package, e.g. these tests below will create a pair of 3-node clusters and link them using
PR or DR replication respectively, and fail if the replication state doesn&#039;t become healthy
before the passed context expires.

Again, as written, these depend on having a Vault Enterprise binary locally and the env
var VAULT_BINARY set to point to it, as well as having VAULT_LICENSE_CI set.

```go
func TestStandardPerfReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)
  if err != nil {
      t.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer r.Cleanup()

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
  defer cancel()
  err = r.StandardPerfReplication(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func TestStandardDRReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer r.Cleanup()

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
  defer cancel()
  err = r.StandardDRReplication(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Finally, here&#039;s an example of running an existing OSS docker test with a custom binary:

```bash
$ GOOS=linux make dev
$ VAULT_BINARY=$(pwd)/bin/vault go test -run &#039;TestRaft_Configuration_Docker&#039; ./vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary
ok      github.com/hashicorp/vault/vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary        20.960s
```

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.

Harbor is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of cloud native technologies, consider joining the CNCF. For details about whose involved and how Harbor plays a role, read the CNCF
[announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/).

## Features

* **Cloud native registry**: With support for both container images and [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts, Harbor serves as registry for cloud native environments like container runtimes and orchestration platforms.
* **Role based access control**: Users access different repositories through &#039;projects&#039; and a user can have different permission for images or Helm charts under a project.
* **Policy based replication**: Images and charts can be replicated (synchronized) between multiple registry instances based on policies with using filters (repository, tag and label). Harbor automatically retries a replication if it encounters any errors. This can be used to assist loadbalancing, achieve high availability, and facilitate multi-datacenter deployments in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Harbor scans images regularly for vulnerabilities and has policy checks to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed.
* **LDAP/AD support**: Harbor integrates with existing enterprise LDAP/AD for user authentication and management, and supports importing LDAP groups into Harbor that can then be given permissions to specific projects.
* **OIDC support**: Harbor leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) to verify the identity of users authenticated by an external authorization server or identity provider. Single sign-on can be enabled to log into the Harbor portal.
* **Image deletion &amp; garbage collection**: System admin can run garbage collection jobs so that images(dangling manifests and unreferenced blobs) can be deleted and their space can be freed up periodically.
* **Notary**: Support signing container images using Docker Content Trust (leveraging Notary) for guaranteeing authenticity and provenance.  In addition, policies that prevent unsigned images from being deployed can also be activated.
* **Graphical user portal**: User can easily browse, search repositories and manage projects.
* **Auditing**: All the operations to the repositories are tracked through logs.
* **RESTful API**: RESTful APIs are provided to facilitate administrative operations, and are easy to use for integration with external systems. An embedded Swagger UI is available for exploring and testing the API.
* **Easy deployment**: Harbor can be deployed via Docker compose as well Helm Chart, and a Harbor Operator was added recently as well.

## Introduction

Syft is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for container images and filesystems. It provides detailed visibility into the packages and dependencies in your software, helping you manage vulnerabilities, license compliance, and software supply chain security.

Syft development is sponsored by [Anchore](https://anchore.com/), and is released under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file). For commercial support options with Syft or Grype, please [contact Anchore](https://get.anchore.com/contact/).

## Features
- Generates SBOMs for container images, filesystems, archives, and more to discover packages and libraries
- Supports OCI, Docker and [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) image formats
- Linux distribution identification
- Works seamlessly with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) (a fast, modern vulnerability scanner)
- Able to create signed SBOM attestations using the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md)
- Convert between SBOM formats, such as CycloneDX, SPDX, and Syft&#039;s own format.

## Installation

Syft binaries are provided for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Recommended
&gt; ```bash 
&gt; curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
&gt; ```

Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Homebrew
```bash
brew install syft
```

### Scoop

```powershell
scoop install syft
```

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of Syft is community-maintained and not distributed by the Anchore team

```powershell
choco install syft -y
```

### Nix

**Note**: Nix packaging of Syft is [community maintained](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/sy/syft/package.nix). Syft is available in the [stable channel](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_channels#The_official_channels) since NixOS `22.05`.

```bash
nix-env -i syft
```

... or, just try it out in an ephemeral nix shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p syft
```

## Getting started

### SBOM

To generate an SBOM for a container image:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt;
```

The above output includes only software that is visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the SBOM, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

### Output formats

The output format for Syft is configurable as well using the `-o` (or `--output`) option:

```
syft &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the `formats` available are:
- `syft-json`: Use this to get as much information out of Syft as possible!
- `syft-text`: A row-oriented, human-and-machine-friendly output.
- `cyclonedx-xml`: A XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).

- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json@1.5`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `spdx-tag-value`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/).
- `spdx-tag-value@2.2`: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 specification](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.2.2/).
- `spdx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.3 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.3/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `spdx-json@2.2`: A JSON report conforming to the [SPDX 2.2 JSON Schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.2/schemas/spdx-schema.json).
- `github-json`: A JSON report conforming to GitHub&#039;s dependency snapshot format.
- `syft-table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](#using-templates) below.

Note that flags using the @&lt;version&gt; can be used for earlier versions of each specification as well.

OpenTelemetry-Go is the [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
It provides a set of APIs to directly measure performance and behavior of your software and send this data to observability platforms.

## Project Status

| Signal  | Status             |
|---------|--------------------|
| Traces  | Stable             |
| Metrics | Stable             |
| Logs    | Beta[^1]           |

Progress and status specific to this repository is tracked in our
[project boards](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/projects)
and
[milestones](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/milestones).

Project versioning information and stability guarantees can be found in the
[versioning documentation](VERSIONING.md).

[^1]: https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects/43

### Compatibility

OpenTelemetry-Go ensures compatibility with the current supported versions of
the [Go language](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy):

&gt; Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
&gt; For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release.

For versions of Go that are no longer supported upstream, opentelemetry-go will
stop ensuring compatibility with these versions in the following manner:

- A minor release of opentelemetry-go will be made to add support for the new
  supported release of Go.
- The following minor release of opentelemetry-go will remove compatibility
  testing for the oldest (now archived upstream) version of Go. This, and
  future, releases of opentelemetry-go may include features only supported by
  the currently supported versions of Go.

Currently, this project supports the following environments.

| OS       | Go Version | Architecture |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | arm64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | arm64        |
| macOS 13 | 1.24       | amd64        |
| macOS 13 | 1.23       | amd64        |
| macOS    | 1.24       | arm64        |
| macOS    | 1.23       | arm64        |
| Windows  | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Windows  | 1.23       | amd64        |
| Windows  | 1.24       | 386          |
| Windows  | 1.23       | 386          |

While this project should work for other systems, no compatibility guarantees
are made for those systems currently.

## Getting Started

You can find a getting started guide on [opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/getting-started/).

OpenTelemetry&#039;s goal is to provide a single set of APIs to capture distributed
traces and metrics from your application and send them to an observability
platform. This project allows you to do just that for applications written in
Go. There are two steps to this process: instrument your application, and
configure an exporter.

### Instrumentation

To start capturing distributed traces and metric events from your application
it first needs to be instrumented. The easiest way to do this is by using an
instrumentation library for your code. Be sure to check out [the officially
supported instrumentation
libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

If you need to extend the telemetry an instrumentation library provides or want
to build your own instrumentation for your application directly you will need
to use the
[Go otel](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel)
package. The [examples](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/examples)
are a good way to see some practical uses of this process.

### Export

Now that your application is instrumented to collect telemetry, it needs an
export pipeline to send that telemetry to an observability platform.

All officially supported exporters for the OpenTelemetry project are contained in the [exporters directory](./exporters).

| Exporter                              | Logs | Metrics | Traces |
|---------------------------------------|:----:|:-------:|:------:|
| [OTLP](./exporters/otlp/)             |  ✓   |    ✓    |   ✓    |
| [Prometheus](./exporters/prometheus/) |      |    ✓    |        |
| [stdout](./exporters/stdout/)         |  ✓   |    ✓    |   ✓    |
| [Zipkin](./exporters/zipkin/)         |      |         |   ✓    |

## Overview

ingress-nginx is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes using [NGINX](https://www.nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy and load
balancer.

[Learn more about Ingress on the Kubernetes documentation site](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## Get started

See the [Getting Started](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) document.

Do not use in multi-tenant Kubernetes production installations. This project assumes that users that can create Ingress objects are administrators of the cluster. See the [FAQ](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/faq/#faq) for more.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, review the [troubleshooting docs](docs/troubleshooting.md),
[file an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues), or talk to us on the
[#ingress-nginx channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/ingress-nginx) on the Kubernetes Slack server.

## Changelog

See [the list of releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases) for all changes.
For detailed changes for each release, please check the [changelog-$version.md](./changelog) file for the release version.
For detailed changes on the `ingress-nginx` helm chart, please check the changelog folder for a specific version.
[CHANGELOG-$current-version.md](./charts/ingress-nginx/changelog) file.

Kargo is a next-generation continuous delivery and application lifecycle
orchestration platform for Kubernetes. It builds upon
[GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) principles and integrates with existing
technologies, like [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/), to streamline and
automate the progressive rollout of changes across the many stages of an
application&#039;s lifecycle.

## What is Broadcast Box

Broadcast Box lets you broadcast to others in sub-second time. It was designed
to be simple to use and easily modifiable. We wrote Broadcast Box to show off some
of the cutting edge tech that is coming to the broadcast space.

Want to contribute to the development of Broadcast Box? See [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Sub-second Latency

Broadcast Box uses WebRTC for broadcast and playback. By using WebRTC instead of
RTMP and HLS you get the fastest experience possible.

### Latest in Video Compression

With WebRTC you get access to the latest in video codecs. With AV1 you can send
the same video quality with a [50%][av1-practical-use-case] reduction in bandwidth required.

[av1-practical-use-case]: https://engineering.fb.com/2018/04/10/video-engineering/av1-beats-x264-and-libvpx-vp9-in-practical-use-case/

### Broadcast all angles

WebRTC allows you to upload multiple video streams in the same session. Now you can
broadcast multiple camera angles, or share interactive video experiences in real time!

### Broadcasters provide transcodes

Transcodes are necessary if you want to provide a good experience to all your users.
Generating them is prohibitively expensive though, WebRTC provides a solution. With WebRTC
users can upload the same video at different quality levels. This
keeps things cheap for the server operator and you still can provide the same
experience.

### Broadcasting for all

WebRTC means anyone can be a broadcaster. With Broadcast Box you could use broadcast software like OBS.
However, another option is publishing directly from your browser! Users just getting started with streaming
don&#039;t need to worry about bitrates, codecs anymore. With one press of a button you can go live right from
your browser with Broadcast Box. This makes live-streaming accessible to an entirely new audience.

### Peer-to-Peer (if you need it)

With Broadcast Box you can serve your video without a public IP or forwarding ports!

Run Broadcast Box on the same machine that you are running OBS, and share your
video with the world! WebRTC comes with P2P technology, so users can broadcast
and playback video without paying for dedicated servers. To start the connection users will
need to be able to connect to the HTTP server. After they have negotiated the session then
NAT traversal begins.

You could also use P2P to pull other broadcasters into your stream. No special configuration
or servers required anymore to get sub-second co-streams.

Broadcast Box acts as a [SFU][applied-webrtc-article]. This means that
every client connects to Broadcast Box. No direct connection is established between broadcasters/viewers.
If you want a direct connection between OBS and your browser see [OBS2Browser][obs-2-browser-repo].

## Using

To use Broadcast Box you don&#039;t even have to run it locally! A instance of Broadcast Box
is hosted at [b.siobud.com](https://b.siobud.com). If you wish to run it locally skip to [Getting Started](#getting-started)

### Broadcasting

To use Broadcast Box with OBS you must set your output to WebRTC and set a proper URL + Stream Key.
You may use any Stream Key you like. The same stream key is used for broadcasting and playback.

Go to `Settings -&gt; Stream` and set the following values.

- Service: WHIP
- Server: &lt;https://b.siobud.com/api/whip&gt;
- StreamKey: (Any Stream Key you like)

Your settings page should look like this:

![OBS Stream settings example](./.github/img/streamSettings.png)

OBS by default will have ~2 seconds of latency. If you want sub-second latency you can configure
this in `Settings -&gt; Output`. Set your encoder to `x264` and set tune to `zerolatency`. Your Output
page will look like this.

![OBS Output settings example](./.github/img/outputPage.png)

When you are ready to broadcast press `Start Streaming` and now time to watch!

### Broadcasting (GStreamer, CLI)

See the example script [here](examples/gstreamer-broadcast.nu).

Can broadcast gstreamer&#039;s test sources, or pulsesrc+v4l2src

Expects `gstreamer-1.0`, with `good,bad,ugly` plugins and `gst-plugins-rs`

Use of example scripts:

```shell
# testsrcs
./examples/gstreamer-broadcast.nu http://localhost:8080/api/whip testStream1
# v4l2src
./examples/gstreamer-broadcast.nu http://localhost:8080/api/whip testStream1 v4l2
```

### Playback

If you are broadcasting to the Stream Key `StreamTest` your video will be available at &lt;https://b.siobud.com/StreamTest&gt;.

You can also go to the home page and enter `StreamTest`. The following is a screenshot of OBS broadcasting and
the latency of 120 milliseconds observed.

## Getting Started

Broadcast Box is made up of two parts. The server is written in Go and is in charge of ingesting and broadcasting WebRTC. The frontend is in react and connects to the Go backend. The Go server can be used to serve the HTML/CSS/JS directly. Use the following instructions to build from source or utilize [Docker](#docker) / [Docker Compose](#docker-compose).

### Configuring

Configurations can be made in [.env.production](./.env.production), although the defaults should get things going.

### Building From Source

#### Frontend

React dependencies are installed by running `npm install` in the `web` directory and `npm run build` will build the frontend.

If everything is successful, you should see the following:

```console
&gt; broadcast-box@0.1.0 build
&gt; dotenv -e ../.env.production react-scripts build

Creating an optimized production build...
Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:

  53.51 kB  build/static/js/main.12067218.js
  2.27 kB   build/static/css/main.8738ee38.css
...
```

#### Backend

Go dependencies are automatically installed.

To run the Go server, run `go run .` in the root of this project, you should see the following:

```console
2022/12/11 16:02:14 Loading `.env.production`
2022/12/11 16:02:14 Running HTTP Server at `:8080`
```

To use Broadcast Box navigate to: `http://&lt;YOUR_IP&gt;:8080`. In your broadcast tool of choice, you will broadcast to `http://&lt;YOUR_IP&gt;:8080/api/whip`.

### Docker

A Docker image is also provided to make it easier to run locally and in production. The arguments you run the Dockerfile with depending on
if you are using it locally or a server.

If you want to run locally execute `docker run -e UDP_MUX_PORT=8080 -e NAT_1_TO_1_IP=127.0.0.1 -p 8080:8080 -p 8080:8080/udp seaduboi/broadcast-box`.
This will make broadcast-box available on `http://localhost:8080`. The UDPMux is needed because Docker on macOS/Windows runs inside a NAT.

If you are running on AWS (or other cloud providers) execute. `docker run --net=host -e INCLUDE_PUBLIC_IP_IN_NAT_1_TO_1_IP=yes seaduboi/broadcast-box`
broadcast-box needs to be run in net=host mode. broadcast-box listens on random UDP ports to establish sessions.

### Docker Compose

A Docker Compose is included that uses LetsEncrypt for automated HTTPS. It also includes Watchtower so your instance of Broadcast Box
will be automatically updated every night. If you are running on a VPS/Cloud server this is the quickest/easiest way to get started.

```console
export URL=my-server.com
docker-compose up -d
```
## URL Parameters

The frontend can be configured by passing these URL Parameters.

- `cinemaMode=true` - Forces the player into cinema mode by adding to end of URL like https://b.siobud.com/myStream?cinemaMode=true

## Environment Variables

The backend can be configured with the following environment variables.

- `DISABLE_STATUS` - Disable the status API
- `DISABLE_FRONTEND` - Disable the serving of frontend. Only REST APIs + WebRTC is enabled.
- `HTTP_ADDRESS` - HTTP Server Address
- `NETWORK_TEST_ON_START` - When &quot;true&quot; on startup Broadcast Box will check network connectivity

- `ENABLE_HTTP_REDIRECT` - HTTP traffic will be redirect to HTTPS
- `SSL_CERT` - Path to SSL certificate if using Broadcast Box&#039;s HTTP Server
- `SSL_KEY` - Path to SSL key if using Broadcast Box&#039;s HTTP Server

- `NAT_1_TO_1_IP` - Announce IPs that don&#039;t belong to local machine (like Public IP). delineated by &#039;|&#039;
- `INCLUDE_PUBLIC_IP_IN_NAT_1_TO_1_IP` - Like `NAT_1_TO_1_IP` but autoconfigured
- `INTERFACE_FILTER` - Only use a certain interface for UDP traffic
- `NAT_ICE_CANDIDATE_TYPE` - By default setting a NAT_1_TO_1_IP overrides. Set this to `srflx` to instead append IPs
- `STUN_SERVERS` - List of STUN servers delineated by &#039;|&#039;. Useful if Broadcast Box is running behind a NAT
- `NETWORK_TYPES` - List of network types to use, delineated by &#039;|&#039;. Default is `udp4|udp6`.
- `INCLUDE_LOOPBACK_CANDIDATE` - Also listen for WebRTC traffic on loopback, disabled by default

- `UDP_MUX_PORT_WHEP` - Like `UDP_MUX_PORT` but only for WHEP traffic
- `UDP_MUX_PORT_WHIP` - Like `UDP_MUX_PORT` but only for WHIP traffic
- `UDP_MUX_PORT` - Serve all UDP traffic via one port. By default Broadcast Box listens on a random port

- `TCP_MUX_ADDRESS` - If you wish to make WebRTC traffic available via TCP.
- `TCP_MUX_FORCE` - If you wish to make WebRTC traffic only available via TCP.

- `APPEND_CANDIDATE` - Append candidates to Offer that ICE Agent did not generate. Worse version of `NAT_1_TO_1_IP`

- `DEBUG_PRINT_OFFER` - Print WebRTC Offers from client to Broadcast Box. Debug things like accepted codecs.
- `DEBUG_PRINT_ANSWER` - Print WebRTC Answers from Broadcast Box to Browser. Debug things like IP/Ports returned to client.

## Network Test on Start

When running in Docker Broadcast Box runs a network tests on startup. This tests that WebRTC traffic can be established
against your server. If you server is misconfigured Broadcast Box will not start.

If the network test is enabled this will be printed on startup

```console
NETWORK_TEST_ON_START is enabled. If the test fails Broadcast Box will exit.
See the README.md for how to debug or disable NETWORK_TEST_ON_START
```

If the test passed you will see

```console
Network Test passed.
Have fun using Broadcast Box
```

If the test failed you will see the following. The middle sentence will change depending on the error.

```console
Network Test failed.
Network Test client reported nothing in 30 seconds
Please see the README and join Discord for help
```

[Join the Discord][discord-invite-url] and we are ready to help! To debug check the following.

- Have you allowed UDP traffic?
- Do you have any restrictions on ports?
- Is your server publicly accessible?

If you wish to disable the test set the environment variable `NETWORK_TEST_ON_START` to false.

## Design

The backend exposes three endpoints (the status page is optional, if hosting locally).

- `/api/whip` - Start a WHIP Session. WHIP broadcasts video via WebRTC.
- `/api/whep` - Start a WHEP Session. WHEP is video playback via WebRTC.
- `/api/status` - Status of the all active WHIP streams

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most
painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across **all** the platforms and
architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and
Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.
This project has been
[forked](https://blog.gitea.com/welcome-to-gitea/) from
[Gogs](https://gogs.io) since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit [demo.gitea.com](https://demo.gitea.com).

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit [gitea.com](https://gitea.com/user/login).

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at [cloud.gitea.com](https://cloud.gitea.com).

## Documentation

You can find comprehensive documentation on our official [documentation website](https://docs.gitea.com/).

It includes installation, administration, usage, development, contributing guides, and more to help you get started and explore all features effectively.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to it, you can visit the [documentation repository](https://gitea.com/gitea/docs)

## Building

From the root of the source tree, run:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata&quot; make build

or if SQLite support is required:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify&quot; make build

The `build` target is split into two sub-targets:

- `make backend` which requires [Go Stable](https://go.dev/dl/), the required version is defined in [go.mod](/go.mod).
- `make frontend` which requires [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater.

Internet connectivity is required to download the go and npm modules. When building from the official source tarballs which include pre-built frontend files, the `frontend` target will not be triggered, making it possible to build without Node.js.

More info: https://docs.gitea.com/installation/install-from-source

## Using

After building, a binary file named `gitea` will be generated in the root of the source tree by default. To run it, use:

    ./gitea web

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re interested in using our APIs, we have experimental support with [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/api).

## Contributing

Expected workflow is: Fork -&gt; Patch -&gt; Push -&gt; Pull Request

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; 1. **YOU MUST READ THE [CONTRIBUTORS GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md) BEFORE STARTING TO WORK ON A PULL REQUEST.**
&gt; 2. If you have found a vulnerability in the project, please write privately to **security@gitea.io**. Thanks!

## Translating

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/gitea/localized.svg)](https://translate.gitea.com)

Translations are done through [Crowdin](https://translate.gitea.com). If you want to translate to a new language ask one of the managers in the Crowdin project to add a new language there.

You can also just create an issue for adding a language or ask on discord on the #translation channel. If you need context or find some translation issues, you can leave a comment on the string or ask on Discord. For general translation questions there is a section in the docs. Currently a bit empty but we hope to fill it as questions pop up.

Get more information from [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/contributing/localization).

## Official and Third-Party Projects

We provide an official [go-sdk](https://gitea.com/gitea/go-sdk), a CLI tool called [tea](https://gitea.com/gitea/tea) and an [action runner](https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner) for Gitea Action.

We maintain a list of Gitea-related projects at [gitea/awesome-gitea](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea), where you can discover more third-party projects, including SDKs, plugins, themes, and more.

Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by:

* **Watching** for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable
* **Evaluating** scheduling constraints (resource requests, nodeselectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints) requested by the pods
* **Provisioning** nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
* **Removing** the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed

Come discuss Karpenter in the [#karpenter](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C02SFFZSA2K) channel, in the [Kubernetes slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) or join the [Karpenter working group](https://karpenter.sh/docs/contributing/working-group/) bi-weekly calls. If you want to contribute to the Karpenter project, please refer to the Karpenter docs.

CoreDNS is a DNS server/forwarder, written in Go, that chains [plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins).
Each plugin performs a (DNS) function.

CoreDNS is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) graduated project.

CoreDNS is a fast and flexible DNS server. The key word here is *flexible*: with CoreDNS you
are able to do what you want with your DNS data by utilizing plugins. If some functionality is not
provided out of the box you can add it by [writing a plugin](https://coredns.io/explugins).

CoreDNS can listen for DNS requests coming in over:
* UDP/TCP (go&#039;old DNS).
* TLS - DoT ([RFC 7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)).
* DNS over HTTP/2 - DoH ([RFC 8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484)).
* DNS over QUIC - DoQ ([RFC 9250](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9250)). 
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io) (not a standard).

Currently CoreDNS is able to:

* Serve zone data from a file; both DNSSEC (NSEC only) and DNS are supported (*file* and *auto*).
* Retrieve zone data from primaries, i.e., act as a secondary server (AXFR only) (*secondary*).
* Sign zone data on-the-fly (*dnssec*).
* Load balancing of responses (*loadbalance*).
* Allow for zone transfers, i.e., act as a primary server (*file* + *transfer*).
* Automatically load zone files from disk (*auto*).
* Caching of DNS responses (*cache*).
* Use etcd as a backend (replacing [SkyDNS](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns)) (*etcd*).
* Use k8s (kubernetes) as a backend (*kubernetes*).
* Serve as a proxy to forward queries to some other (recursive) nameserver (*forward*).
* Provide metrics (by using Prometheus) (*prometheus*).
* Provide query (*log*) and error (*errors*) logging.
* Integrate with cloud providers (*route53*).
* Support the CH class: `version.bind` and friends (*chaos*).
* Support the RFC 5001 DNS name server identifier (NSID) option (*nsid*).
* Profiling support (*pprof*).
* Rewrite queries (qtype, qclass and qname) (*rewrite* and *template*).
* Block ANY queries (*any*).
* Provide DNS64 IPv6 Translation (*dns64*).

And more. Each of the plugins is documented. See [coredns.io/plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins)
for all in-tree plugins, and [coredns.io/explugins](https://coredns.io/explugins) for all
out-of-tree plugins.

## Compilation from Source

To compile CoreDNS, we assume you have a working Go setup. See various tutorials if you don’t have
that already configured.

First, make sure your golang version is 1.23.0 or higher as `go mod` support and other api is needed.
See [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for `go mod` details.
Then, check out the project and run `make` to compile the binary:

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/coredns/coredns
$ cd coredns
$ make
~~~

&gt; **_NOTE:_**  extra plugins may be enabled when building by setting the `COREDNS_PLUGINS` environment variable with comma separate list of plugins in the same format as plugin.cfg

This should yield a `coredns` binary.

## Compilation with Docker

CoreDNS requires Go to compile. However, if you already have docker installed and prefer not to
setup a Go environment, you could build CoreDNS easily:

```
docker run --rm -i -t \
    -v $PWD:/go/src/github.com/coredns/coredns -w /go/src/github.com/coredns/coredns \
        golang:1.22 sh -c &#039;GOFLAGS=&quot;-buildvcs=false&quot; make gen &amp;&amp; GOFLAGS=&quot;-buildvcs=false&quot; make&#039;
```

The above command alone will have `coredns` binary generated.

## Examples

When starting CoreDNS without any configuration, it loads the
[*whoami*](https://coredns.io/plugins/whoami) and [*log*](https://coredns.io/plugins/log) plugins
and starts listening on port 53 (override with `-dns.port`), it should show the following:

~~~ txt
.:53
CoreDNS-1.6.6
linux/amd64, go1.16.10, aa8c32
~~~

The following could be used to query the CoreDNS server that is running now:

~~~ txt
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 www.example.com
~~~

Any query sent to port 53 should return some information; your sending address, port and protocol
used. The query should also be logged to standard output.

The configuration of CoreDNS is done through a file named `Corefile`. When CoreDNS starts, it will
look for the `Corefile` from the current working directory. A `Corefile` for CoreDNS server that listens
on port `53` and enables `whoami` plugin is:

~~~ corefile
.:53 {
    whoami
}
~~~

Sometimes port number 53 is occupied by system processes. In that case you can start the CoreDNS server
while modifying the `Corefile` as given below so that the CoreDNS server starts on port 1053.

~~~ corefile
.:1053 {
    whoami
}
~~~

If you have a `Corefile` without a port number specified it will, by default, use port 53, but you can
override the port with the `-dns.port` flag: `coredns -dns.port 1053`, runs the server on port 1053.

You may import other text files into the `Corefile` using the _import_ directive.  You can use globs to match multiple
files with a single _import_ directive.

~~~ txt
.:53 {
    import example1.txt
}
import example2.txt
~~~

You can use environment variables in the `Corefile` with `{$VARIABLE}`.  Note that each environment variable is inserted
into the `Corefile` as a single token. For example, an environment variable with a space in it will be treated as a single
token, not as two separate tokens.

~~~ txt
.:53 {
    {$ENV_VAR}
}
~~~

A Corefile for a CoreDNS server that forward any queries to an upstream DNS (e.g., `8.8.8.8`) is as follows:

~~~ corefile
.:53 {
    forward . 8.8.8.8:53
    log
}
~~~

Start CoreDNS and then query on that port (53). The query should be forwarded to 8.8.8.8 and the
response will be returned. Each query should also show up in the log which is printed on standard
output.

To serve the (NSEC) DNSSEC-signed `example.org` on port 1053, with errors and logging sent to standard
output. Allow zone transfers to everybody, but specifically mention 1 IP address so that CoreDNS can
send notifies to it.

~~~ txt
example.org:1053 {
    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed
    transfer {
        to * 2001:500:8f::53
    }
    errors
    log
}
~~~

Serve `example.org` on port 1053, but forward everything that does *not* match `example.org` to a
recursive nameserver *and* rewrite ANY queries to HINFO.

~~~ txt
example.org:1053 {
    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed
    transfer {
        to * 2001:500:8f::53
    }
    errors
    log
}

. {
    any
    forward . 8.8.8.8:53
    errors
    log
}
~~~

IP addresses are also allowed. They are automatically converted to reverse zones:

~~~ corefile
10.0.0.0/24 {
    whoami
}
~~~
Means you are authoritative for `0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.`.

This also works for IPv6 addresses. If for some reason you want to serve a zone named `10.0.0.0/24`
add the closing dot: `10.0.0.0/24.` as this also stops the conversion.

This even works for CIDR (See RFC 1518 and 1519) addressing, i.e. `10.0.0.0/25`, CoreDNS will then
check if the `in-addr` request falls in the correct range.

Listening on TLS (DoT) and for gRPC? Use:

~~~ corefile
tls://example.org grpc://example.org {
    whoami
}
~~~

Similarly, for QUIC (DoQ):

~~~ corefile
quic://example.org {
    whoami
    tls mycert mykey
}
~~~

And for DNS over HTTP/2 (DoH) use:

~~~ corefile
https://example.org {
    whoami
    tls mycert mykey
}
~~~
in this setup, the CoreDNS will be responsible for TLS termination

you can also start DNS server serving DoH without TLS termination (plain HTTP), but beware that in such scenario there has to be some kind
of TLS termination proxy before CoreDNS instance, which forwards DNS requests otherwise clients will not be able to communicate via DoH with the server
~~~ corefile
https://example.org {
    whoami
}
~~~

Specifying ports works in the same way:

~~~ txt
grpc://example.org:1443 https://example.org:1444 {
    # ...
}
~~~

When no transport protocol is specified the default `dns://` is assumed.

guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Deployment

Examples for deployment via systemd and other use cases can be found in the [deployment
repository](https://github.com/coredns/deployment).

## Deprecation Policy

When there is a backwards incompatible change in CoreDNS the following process is followed:

*  Release x.y.z: Announce that in the next release we will make backward incompatible changes.
*  Release x.y+1.0: Increase the minor version and set the patch version to 0. Make the changes,
   but allow the old configuration to be parsed. I.e. CoreDNS will start from an unchanged
   Corefile.
*  Release x.y+1.1: Increase the patch version to 1. Remove the lenient parsing, so CoreDNS will
   not start if those features are still used.

E.g. 1.3.1 announce a change. 1.4.0 a new release with the change but backward compatible config.
And finally 1.4.1 that removes the config workarounds.

## Security

### Security Audits

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Dify Plugin Daemon

## Overview

Dify Plugin Daemon is a service that manages the lifecycle of plugins. It&#039;s responsible for 3 types of runtimes:

1. Local runtime: runs on the same machine as the Dify server.
2. Debug runtime: listens to a port to wait for a debugging plugin to connect.
3. Serverless runtime: runs on a serverless platform such as AWS Lambda.

Dify api server will communicate with the daemon to get all the status of plugins like which plugin was installed to which workspace, and receive requests from Dify api server to invoke a plugin like a serverless function.

All requests from Dify api based on HTTP protocol, but depends on the runtime type, the daemon will forward the request to the corresponding runtime in different ways.

- For local runtime, daemon will start plugin as the subprocess and communicate with the plugin via STDIN/STDOUT.
- For debug runtime, daemon wait for a plugin to connect and communicate in full-duplex way, it&#039;s TCP based.
- For serverless runtime, plugin will be packaged to a third-party service like AWS Lambda and then be invoked by the daemon via HTTP protocol.

For more detailed introduction about Dify plugin, please refer to our docs [https://docs.dify.ai/plugins/introduction](https://docs.dify.ai/plugins/introduction).

## CLI

A CLI tool is provided for plugin development on local environment.

- Install via `brew`

Both Linux and MacOS on either arm64 or amd64 architecture are supported.

1. Tapping the [Homebrew tap for Dify CLI](https://github.com/langgenius/homebrew-dify)
2. Install Dify cli with brew

```bash
brew tap langgenius/dify
brew install dify
```

- Install with the binary file

Download the binary file from the assets&#039; list in [the release page](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-daemon/releases).

## Development

### Run daemon

Firstly copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the correct environment variables like `DB_HOST` etc.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Attention that the `PYTHON_INTERPRETER_PATH` is the path to the python interpreter, please specify the correct path according to your python installation and make sure the python version is 3.11 or higher, as dify-plugin-sdk requires.

We recommend you to use `vscode` to debug the daemon,  and a `launch.json` file is provided in the `.vscode` directory.

### Python environment
#### UV
Daemon uses `uv` to manage the dependencies of plugins, before you start the daemon, you need to install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) by yourself. 

#### Interpreter
There is a possibility that you have multiple python versions installed on your machine, a variable `PYTHON_INTERPRETER_PATH` is provided to specify the python interpreter path for you.

## Deployment

Currently, the daemon only supports Linux and MacOS, lots of adaptions are needed for Windows, feel free to contribute if you need it.

### Docker

&gt; **NOTE:** Since the daemon depends on a shared `cwd` directory for running plugins, it&#039;s not recommended to use network-based volumes or bind mounts from outside the host machine. This could result in poor performance, such as plugins not launching in a timely manner.

uses docker volume to share the directory with the host machine, it&#039;s better for performance.

### Kubernetes

For now, Daemon community edition dose not support smoothly scale out with the number of replicas, If you are interested in this feature, please contact us. we have a more production-ready version for enterprise users.

## Benchmark

Refer to [Benchmark](https://langgenius.github.io/dify-plugin-daemon/benchmark-data/)

## LICENSE

Dify Plugin Daemon is released under the [Apache-2.0 license](LICENSE).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Google APIs Client Library for Go

## Getting Started

```shell
$ go get google.golang.org/api/tasks/v1
$ go get google.golang.org/api/moderator/v1
$ go get google.golang.org/api/urlshortener/v1
... etc ...
```

and using:

```go
package main

import (
        &quot;context&quot;
        &quot;net/http&quot;

        &quot;google.golang.org/api/urlshortener/v1&quot;
)

func main() {
        ctx := context.Background()
        svc, err := urlshortener.NewService(ctx)
        // ...
}
```

* For a longer tutorial, see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client/blob/main/GettingStarted.md).
* For examples, see the [examples directory](https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client/tree/main/examples).
* For support, use the [golang-nuts](https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts) mailing list.

## Status

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/google.golang.org/api.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api)

These are auto-generated Go libraries from the Google Discovery Service&#039;s JSON description files.

Due to the auto-generated nature of this collection of libraries they may contain breaking changes from one release to
the next. The generator itself and the code it produces are considered beta for this reason.

These client libraries are officially supported by Google.  However, the libraries are considered complete and are in
maintenance mode. This means that we will address critical bugs and security issues but will not add any new features.

If you&#039;re working with Google Cloud Platform APIs such as Datastore or Pub/Sub, please use the
[Cloud Client Libraries for Go](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go) instead. These are the new and idiomatic
Go libraries targeted specifically at Google Cloud Platform Services.

## Authorization

By default, each API will use [Google Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials)
for authorization credentials used in calling the API endpoints. This will allow your application to run in many
environments without requiring explicit configuration.

```go
// import &quot;google.golang.org/api/sheets/v4&quot;
client, err := sheets.NewService(ctx)
```

To authorize using a [JSON key file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-service-account-keys), pass
[`option.WithCredentialsFile`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option#WithCredentialsFile) to the `NewService`
function of the desired package. For example:

```go
client, err := sheets.NewService(ctx, option.WithCredentialsFile(&quot;path/to/keyfile.json&quot;))
```

You can exert more control over authorization by using the [`golang.org/x/oauth2`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/oauth2)
package to create an `oauth2.TokenSource`. Then pass [`option.WithTokenSource`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option#WithTokenSource)
to the `NewService` function:

```go
tokenSource := ...
svc, err := sheets.NewService(ctx, option.WithTokenSource(tokenSource))
```

## More information

For some more information related to all of the generated clients please read through our
[package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api#section-documentation).

## Introduction

Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.

We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:

* [SSH nodes](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).
* [Kubernetes clusters](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction/)
* [PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/database-access/).
* [Internal Web apps](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/application-access/introduction/).
* [Windows Hosts](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/desktop-access/introduction/).
* [Networked servers](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).

You can set up Teleport as a [Linux daemon](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo) or a [Kubernetes deployment](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/).

Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:

- No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
- Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
- Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.

Teleport uses [Go crypto](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto). It is _fully compatible with OpenSSH_, `sshd` servers, and `ssh` clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.

## Docker

### Deploy Teleport

If you wish to deploy Teleport inside a Docker container see the
[installation guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/#running-teleport-on-docker).

### For Local Testing and Development

To run a full test suite locally, see [the test dependencies list](BUILD_macos.md#local-tests-dependencies)

## Building Teleport

The `teleport` repository contains the Teleport daemon binary (written in Go)
and a web UI written in TypeScript.

If your intention is to build and deploy for use in a production infrastructure
a released tag should be used.  The default branch, `master`, is the current
development branch for an upcoming major version.  Get the latest release tags
listed at https://goteleport.com/download/ and then use that tag in the `git clone`.
For example `git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git -b v16.0.0` gets release v16.0.0.

### Dockerized Build

It is often easiest to build with Docker, which ensures that all required
tooling is available for the build. To execute a dockerized build, ensure
that docker is installed and running, and execute:

```
make -C build.assets build-binaries
```

### Local Build

#### Dependencies

Ensure you have installed correct versions of necessary dependencies:
* `Go` version from
  [go.mod](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/go.mod#L3)
* If you wish to build the Rust-powered features like Desktop Access, see the
  `Rust` and `Cargo` versions in
  [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/Makefile#L21)
  (search for `RUST_VERSION`)
* For `tsh` version &gt; `10.x` with FIDO2 support, you will need `libfido2` and
  `pkg-config` installed locally
* To build the web UI:
  * [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack). If you have Node.js installed, run `corepack enable pnpm` to make `pnpm` available.
  * If you prefer not to install/use pnpm, but have docker available, you can run `make docker-ui` instead.
  * The `Rust` and `Cargo` version in [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/versions.mk#L11) (search for `RUST_VERSION`) are required.
  * The [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) version in [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/versions.mk#L12) (search for `WASM_PACK_VERSION`) is required.
  * [`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) (which contains `wasm-opt`) is required to be installed manually
    on linux aarch64 (64-bit ARM). You can check if it&#039;s already installed on your system by running `which wasm-opt`. If not you can install it like `apt-get install binaryen` (for Debian-based Linux). `wasm-pack` will install this automatically on other platforms.

For an example of Dev Environment setup on a Mac, see [these instructions](BUILD_macos.md).

#### Perform a build

&gt;**Important**
&gt;
&gt;* The Go compiler is somewhat sensitive to the amount of memory: you will need
   **at least** 1GB of virtual memory to compile Teleport. A 512MB instance
   without swap will **not** work.
&gt;* This will build the latest version of Teleport, **regardless** of whether it
   is stable. If you want to build the latest stable release, run `git checkout`
   and `git submodule update --recursive` to the corresponding tag (for example,
&gt;* run `git checkout v8.0.0`) **before** performing a build.

Get the source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git
cd teleport
```

To perform a build

```shell
make full
```

`tsh` dynamically links against libfido2 by default, to support development
environments, as long as the library itself can be found:

```shell
$ brew install libfido2 pkg-config  # Replace with your package manager of choice

$ make build/tsh
&gt; libfido2 found, setting FIDO2=dynamic
&gt; (...)
```

Release binaries are linked statically against libfido2. You may switch the
linking mode using the FIDO2 variable:

```shell
make build/tsh FIDO2=dynamic # dynamic linking
make build/tsh FIDO2=static  # static linking, for an easy setup use `make enter`
                             # or `build.assets/macos/build-fido2-macos.sh`.
make build/tsh FIDO2=off     # doesn&#039;t link libfido2 in any way
```

`tsh` builds with Touch ID support require access to an Apple Developer account.
If you are a Teleport maintainer, ask the team for access.

#### Build output and run locally

If the build succeeds, the installer will place the binaries in the `build` directory.

Before starting, create default data directories:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p -m0700 /var/lib/teleport
sudo chown $USER /var/lib/teleport
```

#### Running Teleport in a hot reload mode

To speed up your development process, you can run Teleport using
[`CompileDaemon`](https://github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon). This will build
and run the Teleport binary, and then rebuild and restart it whenever any Go
source files change.

1. Install CompileDaemon:

    ```shell
    go install github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon@latest
    ```

    Note that we use `go install` instead of the suggested `go get`, because we
    don&#039;t want CompileDaemon to become a dependency of the project.

1. Build and run the Teleport binary:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload
    ```

    By default, this runs a `teleport start` command. If you want to customize
    the command, for example by providing a custom config file location, you can
    use the `TELEPORT_ARGS` parameter:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload TELEPORT_ARGS=&#039;start --config=/path/to/config.yaml&#039;
    ```

Note that you still need to run [`make grpc`](api/proto/README.md) if you modify
any Protocol Buffers files to regenerate the generated Go sources; regenerating
these sources should in turn cause the CompileDaemon to rebuild and restart
Teleport.

### Web UI

The Teleport Web UI resides in the [web](web) directory.

#### Rebuilding Web UI for development

To rebuild the Teleport UI package, run the following command:

```bash
make docker-ui
```

Then you can replace Teleport Web UI files with the files from the newly-generated `/dist` folder.

To enable speedy iterations on the Web UI, you can run a [local web-dev server](web#web-ui).

You can also tell Teleport to load the Web UI assets from the source directory.
To enable this behavior, set the environment variable `DEBUG=1` and rebuild with the default target:

```bash
# Run Teleport as a single-node cluster in development mode:
DEBUG=1 ./build/teleport start -d
```

Keep the server running in this mode, and make your UI changes in `/dist` directory.
For instructions about how to update the Web UI, read [the `web` README](web#readme).

### Managing dependencies

All dependencies are managed using [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules). Here are the instructions for some common tasks:

#### Add a new dependency

Latest version:

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency
```

and update the source to use this dependency.


To get a specific version, use `go get github.com/new/dependency@version` instead.

#### Set dependency to a specific version

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency@version
```

#### Update dependency to the latest version

```bash
go get -u github.com/new/dependency
```

#### Update all dependencies

```bash
go get -u all
```

#### Debugging dependencies

Why is a specific package imported?

`go mod why $pkgname`

Why is a specific module imported?

`go mod why -m $modname`

Why is a specific version of a module imported?

`go mod graph | grep $modname`

### Devbox Build (experimental)

**Note**: Devbox support is still experimental. It&#039;s very possible things may not work as intended.

Teleport can be built using [devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox). To use devbox, follow
the instructions to install devbox [here](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/docs/quickstart/) and
then run:

`devbox shell`

This will install Teleport&#039;s various build dependencies and drop you into a shell with these
dependencies. From here, you can build Teleport normally.

#### flake.nix

A nix flake is located in `build.assets/flake` that allows for installation of Teleport&#039;s less
common build tooling. If this flake is updated, run:

`devbox install`

in order to make sure the changes in the flake are reflected in the local devbox shell.

## Why did We Build Teleport?

The Teleport creators used to work together at Rackspace. We noticed that most cloud computing users struggle with setting up and configuring infrastructure security because popular tools, while flexible, are complex to understand and expensive to maintain. Additionally, most organizations use multiple infrastructure form factors such as several cloud providers, multiple cloud accounts, servers in colocation, and even smart devices. Some of those devices run on untrusted networks, behind third-party firewalls. This only magnifies complexity and increases operational overhead.

We had a choice, either start a security consulting business or build a solution that&#039;s dead-easy to use and understand. A real-time representation of all of your servers in the same room as you, as if they were magically _teleported_. Thus, Teleport was born!

## Ballad of asdf

&gt; Once upon a time there was a programming language&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; There were many versions of it&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; So people wrote a version manager for it&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; To switch between versions for projects&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Different, old, new.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there came more programming languages&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; So there came more version managers&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; And many commands for them
&gt; 
&gt; I installed a lot of them&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; I learnt a lot of commands
&gt; 
&gt; Then I said, just one more version manager&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Which I will write instead
&gt; 
&gt; So, there came another version manager&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; **asdf version manager** - &lt;https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; A version manager so extendable&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; for which anyone can create a plugin&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; To support their favourite language&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; No more installing more version managers&lt;br/&gt;
&gt; Or learning more commands

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/10508/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/10508)

OpenTofu is an OSS tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. OpenTofu can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of OpenTofu are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: OpenTofu has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what OpenTofu will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when OpenTofu manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: OpenTofu builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, OpenTofu builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what OpenTofu will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.

## Documentation

This README is a part of the complete documentation, available [here](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/).

## What It Does

Inspired by [Kubernetes DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns), Kubernetes&#039; cluster-internal DNS server, ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers.
Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/api/) to determine a desired list of DNS records.
_Unlike_ KubeDNS, however, it&#039;s not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly—e.g. [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/).

In a broader sense, ExternalDNS allows you to control DNS records dynamically via Kubernetes resources in a DNS provider-agnostic way.

The [FAQ](docs/faq.md) contains additional information and addresses several questions about key concepts of ExternalDNS.

To see ExternalDNS in action, have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HQ2XgL9YVI) or read this [blogpost](https://codemine.be/posts/20190125-devops-eks-externaldns/).

## The Latest Release

- [current release process](./docs/release.md)

ExternalDNS allows you to keep selected zones (via `--domain-filter`) synchronized with Ingresses and Services of `type=LoadBalancer` and nodes in various DNS providers:

- [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/)
- [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- [AWS Cloud Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/)
- [AzureDNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/dns)

- [Plural](https://www.plural.sh/)
- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)
- [Alibaba Cloud DNS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/dns)

ExternalDNS is, by default, aware of the records it is managing, therefore it can safely manage non-empty hosted zones.
We strongly encourage you to set `--txt-owner-id` to a unique value that doesn&#039;t change for the lifetime of your cluster.
You might also want to run ExternalDNS in a dry run mode (`--dry-run` flag) to see the changes to be submitted to your DNS Provider API.

Note that all flags can be replaced with environment variables; for instance,
`--dry-run` could be replaced with `EXTERNAL_DNS_DRY_RUN=1`.

## New providers

No new provider will be added to ExternalDNS _in-tree_.

ExternalDNS has introduced a webhook system, which can be used to add a new provider.
See PR #3063 for all the discussions about it.

## Status of in-tree providers

ExternalDNS supports multiple DNS providers which have been implemented by the [ExternalDNS contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/graphs/contributors).
Maintaining all of those in a central repository is a challenge, which introduces lots of toil and potential risks.

This mean that `external-dns` has begun the process to move providers out of tree. See #4347 for more details.
Those who are interested can create a webhook provider based on an _in-tree_ provider and after submit a PR to reference it here.

We define the following stability levels for providers:

- **Stable**: Used for smoke tests before a release, used in production and maintainers are active.
- **Beta**: Community supported, well tested, but maintainers have no access to resources to execute integration tests on the real platform and/or are not using it in production.
- **Alpha**: Community provided with no support from the maintainers apart from reviewing PRs.

The following table clarifies the current status of the providers according to the aforementioned stability levels:

| Provider                        | Status | Maintainers      |

### Running Locally

See the [contributor guide](docs/contributing/dev-guide.md) for details on compiling
from source.

#### Setup Steps

Next, run an application and expose it via a Kubernetes Service:

```console
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80
kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

Annotate the Service with your desired external DNS name. Make sure to change `example.org` to your domain.

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname=nginx.example.org.&quot;
```

Optionally, you can customize the TTL value of the resulting DNS record by using the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl` annotation:

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=10&quot;
```

For more details on configuring TTL, see [here](docs/advanced/ttl.md).

Use the internal-hostname annotation to create DNS records with ClusterIP as the target.

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname=nginx.internal.example.org.&quot;
```

If the service is not of type Loadbalancer you need the --publish-internal-services flag.

Locally run a single sync loop of ExternalDNS.

```console
external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service --once --dry-run
```

This should output the DNS records it will modify to match the managed zone with the DNS records you desire.
It also assumes you are running in the `default` namespace. See the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for more information regarding namespaces.

Note: TXT records will have the `my-cluster-id` value embedded. Those are used to ensure that ExternalDNS is aware of the records it manages.

Once you&#039;re satisfied with the result, you can run ExternalDNS like you would run it in your cluster: as a control loop, and **not in dry-run** mode:

```console
external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service
```

Check that ExternalDNS has created the desired DNS record for your Service and that it points to its load balancer&#039;s IP. Then try to resolve it:

```console
dig +short nginx.example.org.
104.155.60.49
```

Now you can experiment and watch how ExternalDNS makes sure that your DNS records are configured as desired. Here are a couple of things you can try out:

- Change the desired hostname by modifying the Service&#039;s annotation.
- Recreate the Service and see that the DNS record will be updated to point to the new load balancer IP.
- Add another Service to create more DNS records.
- Remove Services to clean up your managed zone.

The **tutorials** section contains examples, including Ingress resources, and shows you how to set up ExternalDNS in different environments such as other cloud providers and alternative Ingress controllers.

# Note

If using a txt registry and attempting to use a CNAME the `--txt-prefix` must be set to avoid conflicts. Changing `--txt-prefix` will result in lost ownership over previously created records.

If `externalIPs` list is defined for a `LoadBalancer` service, this list will be used instead of an assigned load balancer IP to create a DNS record.
It&#039;s useful when you run bare metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT or in a similar setup, where a load balancer IP differs from a public IP (e.g. with [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf)).

## Contributing

Are you interested in contributing to external-dns? We, the maintainers and community, would love your
suggestions, contributions, and help! Also, the maintainers can be contacted at any time to learn more
about how to get involved.

We also encourage ALL active community participants to act as if they are maintainers, even if you don&#039;t have
&quot;official&quot; write permissions. This is a community effort, we are here to serve the Kubernetes community. If you
have an active interest and you want to get involved, you have real power! Don&#039;t assume that the only people who
can get things done around here are the &quot;maintainers&quot;. We also would love to add more &quot;official&quot; maintainers, so
show us what you can do!

The external-dns project is currently in need of maintainers for specific DNS providers. Ideally each provider
would have at least two maintainers. It would be nice if the maintainers run the provider in production, but it
is not strictly required. Provider listed [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns#status-of-in-tree-providers)
that do not have a maintainer listed are in need of assistance.

Read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and have a look at [the contributing docs](docs/contributing/dev-guide.md) to learn about building the project, the project structure, and the purpose of each package.

For an overview on how to write new Sources and Providers check out [Sources and Providers](docs/contributing/sources-and-providers.md).

## Heritage

ExternalDNS is an effort to unify the following similar projects in order to bring the Kubernetes community an easy and predictable way of managing DNS records across cloud providers based on their Kubernetes resources:

- Kops&#039; [DNS Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/HEAD/dns-controller)
- Zalando&#039;s [Mate](https://github.com/linki/mate)
- Molecule Software&#039;s [route53-kubernetes](https://github.com/wearemolecule/route53-kubernetes)
