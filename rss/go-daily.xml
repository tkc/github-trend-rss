**Note:** Always select the same GitHub tag as the released version you use
to ensure you have the correct example configuration. The `main` branch might
contain unreleased changes. The documentation is available for stable and
development versions:

* [Documentation for the stable version](https://headscale.net/stable/)
* [Documentation for the development version](https://headscale.net/development/)

## What is Tailscale

Tailscale is [a modern VPN](https://tailscale.com/) built on top of
[Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/).
It [works like an overlay network](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/)
between the computers of your networks - using
[NAT traversal](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/).

Everything in Tailscale is Open Source, except the GUI clients for proprietary OS
(Windows and macOS/iOS), and the control server.

The control server works as an exchange point of Wireguard public keys for the
nodes in the Tailscale network. It assigns the IP addresses of the clients,
creates the boundaries between each user, enables sharing machines between users,
and exposes the advertised routes of your nodes.

A [Tailscale network (tailnet)](https://tailscale.com/kb/1136/tailnet/) is private
network which Tailscale assigns to a user in terms of private users or an
organisation.

## Design goal

Headscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) control server. Headscale&#039;s goal is to
provide self-hosters and hobbyists with an open-source server they can use for
their projects and labs. It implements a narrow scope, a _single_ Tailscale
network (tailnet), suitable for a personal use, or a small open-source
organisation.

## Supporting Headscale

If you like `headscale` and find it useful, there is a sponsorship and donation
buttons available in the repo.

## Features

Please see [&quot;Features&quot; in the documentation](https://headscale.net/stable/about/features/).

## Client OS support

Please see [&quot;Client and operating system support&quot; in the documentation](https://headscale.net/stable/about/clients/).

## Running headscale

**Please note that we do not support nor encourage the use of reverse proxies
and container to run Headscale.**

Please have a look at the [`documentation`](https://headscale.net/stable/).

## Talks

- Fosdem 2023 (video): [Headscale: How we are using integration testing to reimplement Tailscale](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/goheadscale/)
  - presented by Juan Font Alonso and Kristoffer Dalby

## Disclaimer

This project is not associated with Tailscale Inc.

However, one of the active maintainers for Headscale [is employed by Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/blog/opensource) and he is allowed to spend work hours contributing to the project. Contributions from this maintainer are reviewed by other maintainers.

The maintainers work together on setting the direction for the project. The underlying principle is to serve the community of self-hosters, enthusiasts and hobbyists - while having a sustainable project.

## Contributing

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### Requirements

To contribute to headscale you would need the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org)
and [Buf](https://buf.build) (Protobuf generator).

We recommend using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to setup a development environment. This can
be done with `nix develop`, which will install the tools and give you a shell.
This guarantees that you will have the same dev env as `headscale` maintainers.

### Code style

To ensure we have some consistency with a growing number of contributions,
this project has adopted linting and style/formatting rules:

The **Go** code is linted with [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run) and
formatted with [`golines`](https://github.com/segmentio/golines) (width 88) and
[`gofumpt`](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt).
Please configure your editor to run the tools while developing and make sure to
run `make lint` and `make fmt` before committing any code.

The **Proto** code is linted with [`buf`](https://docs.buf.build/lint/overview) and
formatted with [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).

The **rest** (Markdown, YAML, etc) is formatted with [`prettier`](https://prettier.io).

Check out the `.golangci.yaml` and `Makefile` to see the specific configuration.

### Install development tools

- Go
- Buf
- Protobuf tools

Install and activate:

```shell
nix develop
```

### Testing and building

Some parts of the project require the generation of Go code from Protobuf
(if changes are made in `proto/`) and it must be (re-)generated with:

```shell
make generate
```

**Note**: Please check in changes from `gen/` in a separate commit to make it easier to review.

To run the tests:

```shell
make test
```

To build the program:

```shell
nix build
```

or

```shell
make build
```

### What is DiceDB?

DiceDB is an open-source, fast, reactive, in-memory database optimized for modern hardware. Commonly used as a cache, it offers a familiar interface while enabling real-time data updates through query subscriptions. It delivers higher throughput and lower median latencies, making it ideal for modern workloads.

## Get started

### Setting up DiceDB with Docker

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```bash
$ docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb:latest
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and SDKs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you are looking to setup DiceDB for development or want to setup from source, refer
&gt; our [CONTRIBUTING/README.md](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING/README.md) guide.

## Setting up CLI

### Using cURL

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and you can install it by running the following command

```bash
$ sudo su
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you are working on unsupported OS (as per above script), you can always follow the installation instructions mentioned in the [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) repository.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you are looking to setup DiceDB for development or want to setup from source, refer

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/syncthing/syncthing)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/syncthing/syncthing)

## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

**Talos** is a modern OS for running Kubernetes: secure, immutable, and minimal.
Talos is fully open source, production-ready, and supported by the people at [Sidero Labs](https://www.SideroLabs.com/)
All system management is done via an API - there is no shell or interactive console.
Benefits include:

- **Security**: Talos reduces your attack surface: It&#039;s minimal, hardened, and immutable.
  All API access is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
- **Predictability**: Talos eliminates configuration drift, reduces unknown factors by employing immutable infrastructure ideology, and delivers atomic updates.
- **Evolvability**: Talos simplifies your architecture, increases your agility, and always delivers current stable Kubernetes and Linux versions.

Chaos Monkey randomly terminates virtual machine instances and containers that
run inside of your production environment. Exposing engineers to
failures more frequently incentivizes them to build resilient services.

See the [documentation][docs] for info on how to use Chaos Monkey.

Chaos Monkey is an example of a tool that follows the
[Principles of Chaos Engineering][PoC].

[PoC]: http://principlesofchaos.org/

### Requirements

This version of Chaos Monkey is fully integrated with [Spinnaker], the
continuous delivery platform that we use at Netflix. You must be managing your
apps with Spinnaker to use Chaos Monkey to terminate instances.

Chaos Monkey should work with any backend that Spinnaker supports (AWS, Google
Compute Engine, Azure, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry). It has been tested with
AWS, [GCE][gce-blogpost], and Kubernetes.

### Install locally

To install the Chaos Monkey binary on your local machine:

```
go get github.com/netflix/chaosmonkey/cmd/chaosmonkey
```

### How to deploy

See the [docs] for instructions on how to configure and deploy Chaos Monkey.

### Support

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Trust Wallet Assets Info

![Check](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## Overview

Trust Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://trustwallet.com/assets/images/media/assets/horizontal_blue.png&#039; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

## How to add token

Please note that __brand new tokens are not accepted__,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and __non-minimal circulation__
(for limit details see &lt;https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/requirements&gt;).

### Assets App

The [Assets web app](https://assets.trustwallet.com) can be used for most new token additions (Github account is needed).

### Quick starter

Details of the repository structure and contribution guidelines are listed on the
[Developers site](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/new-asset).
Here is a quick starter summary for the most common use case.


## Documentation

For details, see the [Developers site](https://developer.trustwallet.com):

- [Contribution guidelines](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/repository_details)

- [FAQ](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/faq)

## Scripts

There are several scripts available for maintainers:

- `make check` -- Execute validation checks; also used in continuous integration.
- `make fix` -- Perform automatic fixes where possible
- `make update-auto` -- Run automatic updates from external sources, executed regularly (GitHub action)
- `make add-token asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Create `info.json` file as asset template.
- `make add-tokenlist asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Adds a token to tokenlist.json.
- `make add-tokenlist-extended asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Adds a token to tokenlist-extended.json.

## On Checks

This repo contains a set of scripts for verification of all the information. Implemented as Golang scripts, available through `make check`, and executed in CI build; checks the whole repo.
There are similar check logic implemented:

- in assets-management app; for checking changed token files in PRs, or when creating a PR.  Checks diffs, can be run from browser environment.
- in merge-fee-bot, which runs as a GitHub app shows result in PR comment. Executes in a non-browser environment.

## Trading pair maintenance

Info on supported trading pairs are stored in `tokenlist.json` files.
Trading pairs can be updated --
from Uniswap/Ethereum and PancakeSwap/Smartchain -- using update script (and checking in changes).
Minimal limit values for trading pair inclusion are set in the [config file](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/blob/master/.github/assets.config.yaml).
There are also options for force-include and force-exclude in the config.

## Disclaimer

Trust Wallet team allows anyone to submit new assets to this repository. However, this does not mean that we are in direct partnership with all of the projects.

Trust Wallet team will reject projects that are deemed as scam or fraudulent after careful review.
Trust Wallet team reserves the right to change the terms of asset submissions at any time due to changing market conditions, risk of fraud, or any other factors we deem relevant.

Additionally, spam-like behavior, including but not limited to mass distribution of tokens to random addresses will result in the asset being flagged as spam and possible removal from the repository.

[**Click me to see the hotkey wiki**](https://superfile.netlify.app/configure/custom-hotkeys/)

## Notes

We have an auto update functionality, that fetches superfile&#039;s latest released version from github (if last timestamp of last version check was less than 24 hours) and prints a prompt to user, if there is a newer version available.

You can turn this off, by setting `auto_check_update` to false in superfile config. [**Click me to see the config wiki**](https://superfile.netlify.app/configure/superfile-config/)

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step [installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) for our self-hosted [community edition](https://link.photoprism.app/personal-editions) can be found on [docs.photoprism.app](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) - all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The [stable releases](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/) and [development preview](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/updates/#development-preview) are available as a [multi-arch image](https://link.photoprism.app/docker-hub) for 64-bit AMD, Intel, and ARM processors.
That means, [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/) and Apple Silicon users enjoy the exact same functionality and can follow the same [installation steps](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/).

See our [Getting Started FAQ](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-install-photoprism-without-docker) for alternative installation methods, for example using the [*tar.gz* packages](https://dl.photoprism.app/pkg/linux/README.html) we provide.

## Upcoming Features and Enhancements ##

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/photoprism/projects/5&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://dl.photoprism.app/img/ui/2025/upcoming-features-240px.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Our [Project Roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress and what features will be implemented next. You are invited to give ideas you like a thumbs-up, so we know what&#039;s most popular.

Be aware that we have a zero-bug policy and do our best to help users when they need support or have other questions. This comes at a price though, as we can&#039;t give exact release dates for new features. Our team receives many more requests than can be implemented, so we want to emphasize that we are in no way obligated to implement the features, enhancements, or other changes you request. We do, however, appreciate your feedback and carefully consider all requests.

**Because sustained funding is key to quickly releasing new features, we encourage you to support our mission by [signing up for a personal membership](https://link.photoprism.app/membership) or [purchasing a commercial license](https://www.photoprism.app/teams#compare).**

## GitHub Issues ⚠️ ##

We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app. Thank you for your careful consideration!

- When browsing issues, please note that **our team and all issue subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for [discussions, questions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions), or [expressing personal opinions](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct)
- In order for us to investigate [new bug reports](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs), they must include **a complete list of steps to reproduce the problem**, the software versions used and information about the environment in which the problem occurred, such as [browser type, browser version, browser plug-ins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [processor type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu), and [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory)
- [Contact us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives us the opportunity to [improve our documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support instead of dealing with unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by replying to comments

**micro** is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the capabilities
of modern terminals. It comes as a single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies; you can download and use it right now!

As its name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use.
It strives to be enjoyable as a full-time editor for people who prefer to work in a terminal, or those who regularly edit files over SSH.

Here is a picture of micro editing its source code.

![Screenshot](./assets/micro-solarized.png)

To see more screenshots of micro, showcasing some of the default color schemes, see [here](https://micro-editor.github.io).

You can also check out the website for Micro at https://micro-editor.github.io.

## Installation

To install micro, you can download a [prebuilt binary](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/releases), or you can build it from source.

If you want more information about ways to install micro, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/wiki/Installing-Micro).

Use `micro -version` to get the version information after installing. It is only guaranteed that you are installing the most recent
stable version if you install from the prebuilt binaries, Homebrew, or Snap.

A desktop entry file and man page can be found in the [assets/packaging](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/assets/packaging) directory.

### Pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries are distributed in [releases](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/releases).

To uninstall micro, simply remove the binary, and the configuration directory at `~/.config/micro`.

#### Third-party quick-install script

```bash
curl https://getmic.ro | bash
```

The script will place the micro binary in the current directory. From there, you can move it to a directory on your path of your choosing (e.g. `sudo mv micro /usr/bin`). See its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/benweissmann/getmic.ro) for more information.

#### Eget

With [Eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) installed, you can easily get a pre-built binary:

```
eget zyedidia/micro
```

Use `--tag VERSION` to download a specific tagged version.

```
eget --tag nightly zyedidia/micro # download the nightly version (compiled every day at midnight UTC)
eget --tag v2.0.8 zyedidia/micro  # download version 2.0.8 rather than the latest release
```

You can install `micro` by adding `--to /usr/local/bin` to the `eget` command, or move the binary manually to a directory on your `$PATH` after the download completes.

See [Eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) for more information.

### Package managers

You can install micro using Homebrew on Mac:

```
brew install micro
```

**Note for Mac:** All micro keybindings use the control or alt (option) key, not the command
key. By default, macOS terminals do not forward alt key events. To fix this, please see
the section on [macOS terminals](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro#macos-terminal) further below.

On Linux, you can install micro through [snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install)

```
snap install micro --classic
```

Micro is also available through other package managers on Linux such as dnf, AUR, Nix, and package managers
for other operating systems. These packages are not guaranteed to be up-to-date.

&lt;!-- * `apt install micro` (Ubuntu 20.04 `focal`, and Debian `unstable | testing | buster-backports`). At the moment, this package (2.0.1-1) is outdated and has a known bug where debug mode is enabled. --&gt;

* Linux:
    * distro-specific package managers:
        * `dnf install micro` (Fedora).
        * `apt install micro` (Ubuntu and Debian).
        * `pacman -S micro` (Arch Linux).

**Note for Linux desktop environments:**

For interfacing with the local system clipboard, the following tools need to be installed:
* For X11, `xclip` or `xsel`
* For [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), `wl-clipboard`

Without these tools installed, micro will use an internal clipboard for copy and paste, but it won&#039;t be accessible to external applications.

### Building from source

If your operating system does not have a binary release, but does run Go, you can build from source.

Make sure that you have Go version 1.19 or greater and Go modules are enabled.

```
git clone https://github.com/zyedidia/micro
cd micro
make build
sudo mv micro /usr/local/bin # optional
```

The binary will be placed in the current directory and can be moved to
anywhere you like (for example `/usr/local/bin`).

The command `make install` will install the binary to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`.

You can install directly with `go get` (`go get github.com/zyedidia/micro/cmd/micro`) but this isn&#039;t
recommended because it doesn&#039;t build micro with version information (necessary for the plugin manager),
and doesn&#039;t disable debug mode.

### Fully static or dynamically linked binary

By default, the micro binary is linked statically to increase the portability of the prebuilt binaries.
This behavior can simply be overriden by providing `CGO_ENABLED=1` to the build target.

```
CGO_ENABLED=1 make build
```

Afterwards the micro binary will dynamically link with the present core system libraries.

**Note for Mac:**
Native macOS builds are done with `CGO_ENABLED=1` forced set to support adding the &quot;Information Property List&quot; in the linker step.

### macOS terminal

If you are using macOS, you should consider using [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) instead of the default terminal (Terminal.app). The iTerm2 terminal has much better mouse support as well as better handling of key events. For best keybinding behavior, choose `xterm defaults` under `Preferences-&gt;Profiles-&gt;Keys-&gt;Presets...`, and select `Esc+` for `Left Option Key` in the same menu. The newest versions also support true color.

If you still insist on using the default Mac terminal, be sure to set `Use Option key as Meta key` under
`Preferences-&gt;Profiles-&gt;Keyboard` to use &lt;kbd&gt;option&lt;/kbd&gt; as &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;.

### WSL and Windows Console

If you use micro within WSL, it is highly recommended that you use the [Windows
Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&amp;gl=us)
instead of the default Windows Console.

If you must use Windows Console for some reason, note that there is a bug in
Windows Console WSL that causes a font change whenever micro tries to access
the external clipboard via powershell. To fix this, use an internal clipboard
with `set clipboard internal` (though your system clipboard will no longer be
available in micro).

### Colors and syntax highlighting

If you open micro and it doesn&#039;t seem like syntax highlighting is working, this is probably because
you are using a terminal which does not support 256 color mode. Try changing the color scheme to `simple`
by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl-e&lt;/kbd&gt; in micro and typing `set colorscheme simple`.

If you are using the default Ubuntu terminal, to enable 256 color mode make sure your `TERM` variable is set
to `xterm-256color`.

Many of the Windows terminals don&#039;t support more than 16 colors, which means
that micro&#039;s default color scheme won&#039;t look very good. You can either set
the color scheme to `simple`, or download and configure a better terminal emulator
than the Windows default.

### Cygwin, Mingw, Plan9

Cygwin, Mingw, and Plan9 are unfortunately not officially supported. In Cygwin and Mingw, micro will often work when run using
the `winpty` utility:

```
winpty micro.exe ...
```

Micro uses the amazing [tcell library](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell), but this
means that micro is restricted to the platforms tcell supports. As a result, micro does not support
Plan9 or Cygwin (although this may change in the future). Micro also doesn&#039;t support NaCl (which is deprecated anyway).

## Usage

Once you have built the editor, start it by running `micro path/to/file.txt` or `micro` to open an empty buffer.

micro also supports creating buffers from `stdin`:

```sh
ip a | micro
```

You can move the cursor around with the arrow keys and mouse.

You can also use the mouse to manipulate the text. Simply clicking and dragging
will select text. You can also double click to enable word selection, and triple
click to enable line selection.

## Documentation and Help

micro has a built-in help system which you can access by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl-e&lt;/kbd&gt; and typing `help`. Additionally, you can
view the help files here:

- [main help](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/runtime/help/help.md)
- [keybindings](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/runtime/help/keybindings.md)
- [commands](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/runtime/help/commands.md)
- [colors](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/runtime/help/colors.md)
- [options](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/runtime/help/options.md)
- [plugins](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/runtime/help/plugins.md)

I also recommend reading the [tutorial](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/tree/master/runtime/help/tutorial.md) for
a brief introduction to the more powerful configuration features micro offers.

There is also an unofficial Discord, which you can join at https://discord.gg/nhWR6armnR.

## Installation

If you are migrating from another AUR helper, you can simply install Yay with that helper.

&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; We are using `sudo` in these examples, you can switch that out for a different privilege escalation tool.

### Source

The initial installation of Yay can be done by cloning the PKGBUILD and
building with makepkg:

We make sure we have the `base-devel` package group installed.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel &amp;&amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git &amp;&amp; cd yay &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
```

### Binary

If you do not want to compile yay yourself you can use the builds generated by
GitHub Actions.

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel &amp;&amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git &amp;&amp; cd yay-bin &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
```

### Other distributions

If you&#039;re using Manjaro or [another distribution that packages `yay`](https://repology.org/project/yay/versions)
you can simply install yay using pacman (as root):

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel yay
```
&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; distributions sometimes lag updating yay on their repositories.

## First Use

#### Development packages upgrade

- Use `yay -Y --gendb` to generate a development package database for `*-git`
  packages that were installed without yay.
  This command should only be run once.

- `yay -Syu --devel` will then check for development package updates

- Use `yay -Y --devel --save` to make development package updates permanently
  enabled (`yay` and `yay -Syu` will then always check dev packages)

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Yay does not display colored output. How do I fix it?**

  Make sure you have the `Color` option in your `/etc/pacman.conf`
  (see issue [#123](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/123)).

- **Sometimes diffs are printed to the terminal, and other times they are paged via less. How do I fix this?**

  Yay uses `git diff` to display diffs, which by default tells less not to
  page if the output can fit into one terminal length. This behavior can be
  overridden by exporting your own flags (`export LESS=SRX`).

- **Yay is not asking me to edit PKGBUILDS, and I don&#039;t like the diff menu! What can I do?**

  `yay --editmenu --diffmenu=false --save`

- **How can I tell Yay to act only on AUR packages, or only on repo packages?**

  `yay -{OPERATION} --aur`
  `yay -{OPERATION} --repo`

- **A `Flagged Out Of Date AUR Packages` message is displayed. Why doesn&#039;t Yay update them?**

  This message does not mean that updated AUR packages are available. It means
  the packages have been flagged out of date on the AUR, but
  their maintainers have not yet updated the `PKGBUILD`s
  (see [outdated AUR packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Foo_in_the_AUR_is_outdated.3B_what_should_I_do.3F)).

- **Yay doesn&#039;t install dependencies added to a PKGBUILD during installation.**

  Yay resolves all dependencies ahead of time. You are free to edit the
  PKGBUILD in any way, but any problems you cause are your own and should not be
  reported unless they can be reproduced with the original PKGBUILD.

- **I know my `-git` package has updates but yay doesn&#039;t offer to update it**

  Yay uses a hash cache for development packages. Normally it is updated at the end of the package install with the message `Found git repo`.
  If you transition between aur helpers and did not install the devel package using yay at some point, it is possible it never got added to the cache. `yay -Y --gendb` will fix the current version of every devel package and start checking from there.

- **I want to help out!**

  Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Support

All support related to Yay should be requested via GitHub issues. Since Yay is not
officially supported by Arch Linux, support should not be sought out on the
forums, AUR comments or other official channels.

A broken AUR package should be reported as a comment on the package&#039;s AUR page.
A package may only be considered broken if it fails to build with makepkg.

Reports should be made using makepkg and include the full output as well as any
other relevant information. Never make reports using Yay or any other external
tools.

## ✨ NEW ✨

### Google Gemini Multimodal Live support

Introducing support for the Gemini Multimodal Live feature. Here&#039;s an example Multimodal Live server showing realtime conversation and video streaming: [code](./examples/live/live_streaming_server.go)

# Google Gen AI Go SDK

The Google Gen AI Go SDK enables developers to use Google&#039;s state-of-the-art
generative AI models (like Gemini) to build AI-powered features and applications.
This SDK supports use cases like:
- Generate text from text-only input
- Generate text from text-and-images input (multimodal)
- ...

For example, with just a few lines of code, you can access Gemini&#039;s multimodal
capabilities to generate text from text-and-image input.

```go
parts := []*genai.Part{
  {Text: &quot;What&#039;s this image about?&quot;},
  {InlineData: &amp;genai.Blob{Data: imageBytes, MIMEType: &quot;image/jpeg&quot;}},
}
result, err := client.Models.GenerateContent(ctx, &quot;gemini-2.0-flash&quot;, []*genai.Content{{Parts: parts}}, nil)
```

## Installation and usage

Add the SDK to your module with `go get google.golang.org/genai`.

## Create Clients

### Imports
```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/genai&quot;
```

### Gemini API Client:
```go
client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, &amp;genai.ClientConfig{
	APIKey:   apiKey,
	Backend:  genai.BackendGeminiAPI,
})
```

### Vertex AI Client:
```go
client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, &amp;genai.ClientConfig{
	Project:  project,
	Location: location,
	Backend:  genai.BackendVertexAI,
})
```

kubectl-ai is an AI powered kubernetes agent that runs in your terminal.

![kubectl-ai demo GIF using: kubectl-ai &quot;how&#039;s nginx app doing in my cluster&quot;](./.github/kubectl-ai.gif)

## Quick Start

First, ensure that kubectl is installed and configured.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/releases/latest) for your target machine.

2. Untar the release, make the binary executable and move it to a directory in your $PATH (as shown below).

```shell
$ tar -zxvf kubectl-ai_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
$ chmod a+x kubectl-ai
$ sudo mv kubectl-ai /usr/local/bin/
```

### Usage

#### Using Gemini (Default)

Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable. If you don&#039;t have a key, get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com).

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
kubectl-ai

# Use different gemini model
kubectl-ai --model gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25

# Use 2.5 flash (faster) model
kubectl-ai --quiet --model gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 &quot;check logs for nginx app in hello namespace&quot;
```

#### Using AI models running locally (ollama or llamacpp)

You can use `kubectl-ai` with AI models running locally. `kubectl-ai` supports [ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) to use the AI models running locally.

An example of using Google&#039;s `gemma3` model with `ollama`:

```shell
# assuming ollama is already running and you have pulled one of the gemma models
# ollama pull gemma3:12b-it-qat

# enable-tool-use-shim because models require special prompting to enable tool calling
kubectl-ai --llm-provider ollama --model gemma3:12b-it-qat --enable-tool-use-shim

# you can use `models` command to discover the locally available models
&gt;&gt; models
```

#### Using Azure OpenAI

You can also use Azure OpenAI deployment by setting your OpenAI API key and specifying the provider:

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key_here
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your_azure_openai_endpoint_here
kubectl-ai --llm-provider=azopenai --model=your_azure_openai_deployment_name_here
# or
az login
kubectl-ai --llm-provider=openai://your_azure_openai_endpoint_here --model=your_azure_openai_deployment_name_here
```

#### Using OpenAI

You can also use OpenAI models by setting your OpenAI API key and specifying the provider:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
kubectl-ai --llm-provider=openai --model=gpt-4.1
```

* Note: `kubectl-ai` supports AI models from `gemini`, `vertexai`, `azopenai`, `openai` and local LLM providers such as `ollama` and `llamacpp`.

Run interactively:

```shell
kubectl-ai
```

The interactive mode allows you to have a chat with `kubectl-ai`, asking multiple questions in sequence while maintaining context from previous interactions. Simply type your queries and press Enter to receive responses. To exit the interactive shell, type `exit` or press Ctrl+C.

Or, run with a task as input:

```shell
kubectl-ai -quiet &quot;fetch logs for nginx app in hello namespace&quot;
```

Combine it with other unix commands:

```shell
kubectl-ai &lt; query.txt
# OR
echo &quot;list pods in the default namespace&quot; | kubectl-ai
```

You can even combine a positional argument with stdin input. The positional argument will be used as a prefix to the stdin content:

```shell
cat error.log | kubectl-ai &quot;explain the error&quot;
```

## Extras

You can use the following special keywords for specific actions:

* `model`: Display the currently selected model.
* `models`: List all available models.
* `version`: Display the `kubectl-ai` version.
* `reset`: Clear the conversational context.
* `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.
* `exit` or `quit`: Terminate the interactive shell (Ctrl+C also works).

### Invoking as kubectl plugin

Use it via the `kubectl` plug interface like this: `kubectl ai`.  kubectl will find `kubectl-ai` as long as it&#039;s in your PATH.  For more information about plugins please see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/


### Examples

```bash
# Get information about pods in the default namespace
kubectl-ai -quiet &quot;show me all pods in the default namespace&quot;

# Create a new deployment
kubectl-ai -quiet &quot;create a deployment named nginx with 3 replicas using the nginx:latest image&quot;

# Troubleshoot issues
kubectl-ai -quiet &quot;double the capacity for the nginx app&quot;

# Using Azure OpenAI instead of Gemini
kubectl-ai --llm-provider=azopenai --model=your_azure_openai_deployment_name_here -quiet &quot;scale the nginx deployment to 5 replicas&quot;

# Using OpenAI instead of Gemini
kubectl-ai --llm-provider=openai --model=gpt-4.1 -quiet &quot;scale the nginx deployment to 5 replicas&quot;
```

The `kubectl-ai` will process your query, execute the appropriate kubectl commands, and provide you with the results and explanations.

## k8s-bench

kubectl-ai project includes [k8s-bench](./k8s-bench/README.md) - a benchmark to evaluate performance of different LLM models on kubernetes related tasks. Here is a summary from our last run:

| Model | Success | Fail |
|-------|---------|------|
| gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 | 10 | 0 |
| gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 | 10 | 0 |
| gemma-3-27b-it | 8 | 2 |
| **Total** | 28 | 2 |

See [full report](./k8s-bench.md) for more details.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most
painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across **all** the platforms and
architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and
Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.
This project has been
[forked](https://blog.gitea.com/welcome-to-gitea/) from
[Gogs](https://gogs.io) since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit [demo.gitea.com](https://demo.gitea.com).

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit [gitea.com](https://gitea.com/user/login).

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at [cloud.gitea.com](https://cloud.gitea.com).

## Documentation

You can find comprehensive documentation on our official [documentation website](https://docs.gitea.com/).

It includes installation, administration, usage, development, contributing guides, and more to help you get started and explore all features effectively.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to it, you can visit the [documentation repository](https://gitea.com/gitea/docs)

## Building

From the root of the source tree, run:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata&quot; make build

or if SQLite support is required:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify&quot; make build

The `build` target is split into two sub-targets:

- `make backend` which requires [Go Stable](https://go.dev/dl/), the required version is defined in [go.mod](/go.mod).
- `make frontend` which requires [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater.

Internet connectivity is required to download the go and npm modules. When building from the official source tarballs which include pre-built frontend files, the `frontend` target will not be triggered, making it possible to build without Node.js.

More info: https://docs.gitea.com/installation/install-from-source

## Using

After building, a binary file named `gitea` will be generated in the root of the source tree by default. To run it, use:

    ./gitea web

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re interested in using our APIs, we have experimental support with [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/api).

## Contributing

Expected workflow is: Fork -&gt; Patch -&gt; Push -&gt; Pull Request

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; 1. **YOU MUST READ THE [CONTRIBUTORS GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md) BEFORE STARTING TO WORK ON A PULL REQUEST.**
&gt; 2. If you have found a vulnerability in the project, please write privately to **security@gitea.io**. Thanks!

## Translating

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/gitea/localized.svg)](https://translate.gitea.com)

Translations are done through [Crowdin](https://translate.gitea.com). If you want to translate to a new language ask one of the managers in the Crowdin project to add a new language there.

You can also just create an issue for adding a language or ask on discord on the #translation channel. If you need context or find some translation issues, you can leave a comment on the string or ask on Discord. For general translation questions there is a section in the docs. Currently a bit empty but we hope to fill it as questions pop up.

Get more information from [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/contributing/localization).

## Official and Third-Party Projects

We provide an official [go-sdk](https://gitea.com/gitea/go-sdk), a CLI tool called [tea](https://gitea.com/gitea/tea) and an [action runner](https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner) for Gitea Action.

We maintain a list of Gitea-related projects at [gitea/awesome-gitea](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea), where you can discover more third-party projects, including SDKs, plugins, themes, and more.

Private WireGuard® networks made easy

## Overview

This repository contains the majority of Tailscale&#039;s open source code.
Notably, it includes the `tailscaled` daemon and
the `tailscale` CLI tool. The `tailscaled` daemon runs on Linux, Windows,
[macOS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants/), and to varying degrees
on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The Tailscale iOS and Android apps use this repo&#039;s
code, but this repo doesn&#039;t contain the mobile GUI code.

Other [Tailscale repos](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/repositories) of note:

* the Android app is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android
* the Synology package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology
* the QNAP package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-qpkg
* the Chocolatey packaging is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-chocolatey

For background on which parts of Tailscale are open source and why,
see [https://tailscale.com/opensource/](https://tailscale.com/opensource/).

## Using

We serve packages for a variety of distros and platforms at
[https://pkgs.tailscale.com](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/).

## Other clients

The [macOS, iOS, and Windows clients](https://tailscale.com/download)
use the code in this repository but additionally include small GUI
wrappers. The GUI wrappers on non-open source platforms are themselves
not open source.

## Building

We always require the latest Go release, currently Go 1.23. (While we build
releases with our [Go fork](https://github.com/tailscale/go/), its use is not
required.)

```
go install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}
```

If you&#039;re packaging Tailscale for distribution, use `build_dist.sh`
instead, to burn commit IDs and version info into the binaries:

```
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
```

If your distro has conventions that preclude the use of
`build_dist.sh`, please do the equivalent of what it does in your
distro&#039;s way, so that bug reports contain useful version information.

## Bugs

Please file any issues about this code or the hosted service on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).

## Contributing

PRs welcome! But please file bugs. Commit messages should [reference
bugs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls).

We require [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
`Signed-off-by` lines in commits.

See [commit-messages.md](docs/commit-messages.md) (or skim `git log`) for our commit message style.

## About Us

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is primarily developed by the
people at https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/people. For other contributors,
see:

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it&#039;ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don&#039;t need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It&#039;s based on software we use for our public [AdGuard DNS] servers, and both share a lot of code.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison&quot; id=&quot;comparison&quot; name=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparing AdGuard Home to other solutions&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adguard-dns&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot;&gt;How is this different from public AdGuard DNS servers?&lt;/a&gt;

Running your own AdGuard Home server allows you to do much more than using a public DNS server. It&#039;s a completely different level. See for yourself:

- Choose what exactly the server blocks and permits.

- Monitor your network activity.

- Add your own custom filtering rules.

- **Most importantly, it&#039;s your own server, and you are the only one who&#039;s in control.**

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-pi-hole&quot; id=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot; name=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;

At this point, AdGuard Home has a lot in common with Pi-Hole. Both block ads and trackers using the so-called “DNS sinkholing” method and both allow customizing what&#039;s blocked.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We&#039;re not going to stop here. DNS sinkholing is not a bad starting point, but this is just the beginning.

AdGuard Home provides a lot of features out-of-the-box with no need to install and configure additional software. We want it to be simple to the point when even casual users can set it up with minimal effort.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Some of the listed features can be added to Pi-Hole by installing additional software or by manually using SSH terminal and reconfiguring one of the utilities Pi-Hole consists of. However, in our opinion, this cannot be legitimately counted as a Pi-Hole&#039;s feature.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adblock&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to traditional ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;

It depends.

DNS sinkholing is capable of blocking a big percentage of ads, but it lacks the flexibility and the power of traditional ad blockers. You can get a good impression about the difference between these methods by reading [this article][blog-adaway], which compares AdGuard for Android (a traditional ad blocker) to hosts-level ad blockers (which are almost identical to DNS-based blockers in their capabilities). This level of protection is enough for some users.

Additionally, using a DNS-based blocker can help to block ads, tracking and analytics requests on other types of devices, such as SmartTVs, smart speakers or other kinds of IoT devices (on which you can&#039;t install traditional ad blockers).

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-limitations&quot; id=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot; name=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot;&gt;Known limitations&lt;/a&gt;

Here are some examples of what cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker:

- YouTube, Twitch ads;

- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram sponsored posts.

Essentially, any advertising that shares a domain with content cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker.

Is there a chance to handle this in the future?  DNS will never be enough to do this. Our only option is to use a content blocking proxy like what we do in the standalone AdGuard applications. We&#039;re [going to bring][issue-1228] this feature support to AdGuard Home in the future. Unfortunately, even in this case, there still will be cases when this won&#039;t be enough or would require quite a complicated configuration.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#how-to-build&quot; id=&quot;how-to-build&quot; name=&quot;how-to-build&quot;&gt;How to build from source&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#prerequisites&quot; id=&quot;prerequisites&quot; name=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make init` to prepare the development environment.

You will need this to build AdGuard Home:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.24 or later;
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v20.19 or later;
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v10.8 or later;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#building&quot; id=&quot;building&quot; name=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt;

Open your terminal and execute these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome
cd AdGuardHome
make
```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The non-standard `-j` flag is currently not supported, so building with `make -j 4` or setting your `MAKEFLAGS` to include, for example, `-j 4` is likely to break the build. If you do have your `MAKEFLAGS` set to that, and you don&#039;t want to change it, you can override it by running `make -j 1`.

Check the [`Makefile`][src-makefile] to learn about other commands.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#building-cross&quot; id=&quot;building-cross&quot; name=&quot;building-cross&quot;&gt;Building for a different platform&lt;/a&gt;

You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports. In order to do this, specify `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables as macros when running `make`.

For example:

```sh
env GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039; make
```

or:

```sh
make GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039;
```

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#preparing-releases&quot; id=&quot;preparing-releases&quot; name=&quot;preparing-releases&quot;&gt;Preparing releases&lt;/a&gt;

You&#039;ll need [`snapcraft`] to prepare a release build. Once installed, run the following command:

```sh
make build-release CHANNEL=&#039;...&#039; VERSION=&#039;...&#039;
```

See the [`build-release` target documentation][targ-release].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#docker-image&quot; id=&quot;docker-image&quot; name=&quot;docker-image&quot;&gt;Docker image&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make build-docker` to build the Docker image locally (the one that we publish to DockerHub). Please note, that we&#039;re using [Docker Buildx][buildx] to build our official image.

You may need to prepare before using these builds:

- (Linux-only) Install Qemu:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes --credential yes
  ```

- Prepare the builder:

  ```sh
  docker buildx create --name buildx-builder --driver docker-container --use
  ```

See the [`build-docker` target documentation][targ-docker].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#debugging-the-frontend&quot; id=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot; name=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot;&gt;Debugging the frontend&lt;/a&gt;

When you need to debug the frontend without recompiling the production version every time, for example to check how your labels would look on a form, you can run the frontend build a development environment.

1. In a separate terminal, run:

   ```sh
   ( cd ./client/ &amp;&amp; env NODE_ENV=&#039;development&#039; npm run watch )
   ```

2. Run your `AdGuardHome` binary with the `--local-frontend` flag, which instructs AdGuard Home to ignore the built-in frontend files and use those from the `./build/` directory.

3. Now any changes you make in the `./client/` directory should be recompiled and become available on the web UI. Make sure that you disable the browser cache to make sure that you actually get the recompiled version.

AdGuard Home uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for E2E testing. Tests are located in `tests/e2e`.

**Running Tests:**
- `npm run test:e2e` – run all tests (headless).
- `npm run test:e2e:interactive` – run tests interactively.
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` – run tests in debug mode.
- `npm run test:e2e:codegen` – generate new test code.

**Setup:**
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npx playwright install` to set up required browsers.

&gt; **Warning:** Playwright will download and install its own browser binaries for testing, which may differ from the browsers installed on your system.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#test-unstable-versions&quot; id=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot; name=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot;&gt;Test unstable versions&lt;/a&gt;

There are two update channels that you can use:

- `beta`: beta versions of AdGuard Home. More or less stable versions, usually released every two weeks or more often.

- `edge`: the newest version of AdGuard Home from the development branch. New updates are pushed to this channel daily.

There are three options how you can install an unstable version:

1. [Snap Store]: look for the `beta` and `edge` channels.

2. [Docker Hub]: look for the `beta` and `edge` tags.

3. Standalone builds. Use the automated installation script or look for the available builds [on the Wiki][wiki-platf].

   Script to install a beta version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c beta
   ```

   Script to install an edge version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c edge
   ```

## Quickstart (GKE)

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the latest major version.

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 --branch v0 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
   cd microservices-demo/
   ```

   The `--depth 1` argument skips downloading git history.

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.

4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

5. Deploy Online Boutique to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```

6. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

   productcatalogservice-557d474574-888kr   1/1     Running   0          3m
   recommendationservice-69c56b74d4-7z8r5   1/1     Running   0          3m1s
   redis-cart-5f59546cdd-5jnqf              1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   ```

7. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend&#039;s external IP.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend-external | awk &#039;{print $4}&#039;
   ```

   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Online Boutique.

8. Congrats! You&#039;ve deployed the default Online Boutique. To deploy a different variation of Online Boutique (e.g., with Google Cloud Operations tracing, Istio, etc.), see [Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize](#deploy-online-boutique-variations-with-kustomize).

9. Once you are done with it, delete the GKE cluster.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters delete online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Deleting the cluster may take a few minutes.

## What is KubeSphere

&gt; English | [中文](README_zh.md)

[KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/) is a **distributed operating system for cloud-native application management**,
using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as its kernel. It provides a plug-and-play architecture, allowing third-party
applications to be seamlessly integrated into its ecosystem. KubeSphere is also a multi-tenant container platform with
full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly wizard web UI,
helping enterprises to build out a more robust and feature-rich platform, which includes most common functionalities
needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategy, see [Feature List](#features) for details.

## Architecture

KubeSphere 4.x adopts a microkernel + extension components architecture ([codename LuBan](https://kubesphere.io/docs/v4.1/01-intro/01-introduction/)). The core part (KubeSphere Core) only includes the essential basic functions required for system operation, with independent functional modules split and provided in the form of extension components. Users can dynamically manage the extension components during system operation. With the extension capabilities, KubeSphere can support more application scenarios and meet the needs of different users.

## Known Issues

- `macOS` IPSW etc support is sometimes broken
  
  Automated testing of `ipsw` is challenging as it requires a lot of resources to test all the different IPSW flavors and OS versions etc. No CI/CD can really handle that unless I want to wait forever for it to run on each commit. Please create an [issue](https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw/issues) and I&#039;ll fix it as soon as I can ❤️ *(**NOTE:** a comprehensive test suite is in the roadmap so I can at least test on the few local IPSWs I have)*
