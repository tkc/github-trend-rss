## Quick Start

Ready to get your first agentic workflow running? Follow our step-by-step [Quick Start Guide](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) to install the extension, add a sample workflow, and see it in action.

## Overview

Learn about the concepts behind agentic workflows, explore available workflow types, and understand how AI can automate your repository tasks. See [How It Works](https://github.github.io/gh-aw/introduction/how-they-work/).

## Guardrails

Guardrails, safety and security are foundational to GitHub Agentic Workflows. Workflows run with read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized `safe-outputs`. The system implements multiple layers of protection including sandboxed execution, input sanitization, network isolation, supply chain security (SHA-pinned dependencies), tool allow-listing, and compile-time validation. Access can be gated to team members only, with human approval gates for critical operations, ensuring AI agents operate safely within controlled boundaries. See the [Security Architecture](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) for comprehensive details on threat modeling, implementation guidelines, and best practices.

Using agentic workflows in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

## Documentation

For complete documentation, examples, and guides, see the [Documentation](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/).

## Contributing

For development setup and contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Share Feedback

We welcome your feedback on GitHub Agentic Workflows! Please file bugs and feature requests as issues in this repository, and share your thoughts in the [GitHub Next Discord](https://gh.io/next-discord).

## Peli&#039;s Agent Factory

See the [Peli&#039;s Agent Factory](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/) for a guided tour through many uses of agentic workflows.

# Wave Terminal

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm?ref=badge_shield)

Wave is an open-source terminal that combines traditional terminal features with graphical capabilities like file previews, web browsing, and AI assistance. It runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

Modern development involves constantly switching between terminals and browsers - checking documentation, previewing files, monitoring systems, and using AI tools. Wave brings these graphical tools directly into the terminal, letting you control them from the command line. This means you can stay in your terminal workflow while still having access to the visual interfaces you need.

![WaveTerm Screenshot](./assets/wave-screenshot.webp)

## Key Features

- Flexible drag &amp; drop interface to organize terminal blocks, editors, web browsers, and AI assistants
- Built-in editor for seamlessly editing remote files with syntax highlighting and modern editor features
- Rich file preview system for remote files (markdown, images, video, PDFs, CSVs, directories)
- Quick full-screen toggle for any block - expand terminals, editors, and previews for better visibility, then instantly return to multi-block view
- Wave AI - Context-aware terminal assistant that reads your terminal output, analyzes widgets, and performs file operations
- AI chat widget with support for multiple models (OpenAI, Claude, Azure, Perplexity, Ollama)
- Command Blocks for isolating and monitoring individual commands with auto-close options
- One-click remote connections with full terminal and file system access
- Secure secret storage using native system backends - store API keys and credentials locally, access them across SSH sessions
- Rich customization including tab themes, terminal styles, and background images
- Powerful `wsh` command system for managing your workspace from the CLI and sharing data between terminal sessions
- Connected file management with `wsh file` - seamlessly copy and sync files between local, remote SSH hosts, Wave filesystem, and S3

## Wave AI

Wave AI is your context-aware terminal assistant with access to your workspace:

- **Terminal Context**: Reads terminal output and scrollback for debugging and analysis
- **File Operations**: Read, write, and edit files with automatic backups and user approval
- **CLI Integration**: Use `wsh ai` to pipe output or attach files directly from the command line
- **Free Beta**: Included AI credits while we refine the experience
- **Coming Soon**: Command execution (with approval), local model support, and alternate AI providers (BYOK)

Learn more in our [Wave AI documentation](https://docs.waveterm.dev/waveai).

## 💻 Quickstart

&gt; ⚠️ **Note:** The `install.sh` script is currently experiencing issues due to the heavy changes currently undergoing in LocalAI and may produce broken or misconfigured installations. Please use Docker installation (see below) or manual binary installation until [issue #8032](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/issues/8032) is resolved.

Run the installer script:

```bash
# Basic installation
curl https://localai.io/install.sh | sh
```

For more installation options, see [Installer Options](https://localai.io/installation/).

### macOS Download:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/releases/latest/download/LocalAI.dmg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-macOS-blue?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=apple&amp;logoColor=white&quot; alt=&quot;Download LocalAI for macOS&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&gt; Note: the DMGs are not signed by Apple as quarantined. See https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/issues/6268 for a workaround, fix is tracked here: https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/issues/6244

### Containers (Docker, podman, ...)

&gt; **💡 Docker Run vs Docker Start**
&gt; 
&gt; - `docker run` creates and starts a new container. If a container with the same name already exists, this command will fail.
&gt; - `docker start` starts an existing container that was previously created with `docker run`.
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#039;ve already run LocalAI before and want to start it again, use: `docker start -i local-ai`

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/syncthing/syncthing)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/syncthing/syncthing)

## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

## Documentation

Please see the Syncthing [documentation site][6] [[source]][17].

### Multiple Kubernetes Clusters and Multiple Clouds

&lt;img src =&quot;https://meshery.io/assets/images/screens/multi-cluster-management.gif&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Meshery provides a single pane of glass to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure, including various cloud providers. Meshery enables consistent configuration, operation, and observability across your entire Kubernetes landscape.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dry-run your deployments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Meshery leverages Kubernetes&#039; built-in dry-run capabilities to allow you to simulate deployments without actually applying the changes to your cluster. This enables you to:

- Validate configurations: Ensure your deployment specifications (e.g., YAML manifests, Helm charts, Meshery Designs) are syntactically correct and will be accepted by the Kubernetes API server.   
- Identify potential issues: Detect errors in your configurations, such as invalid resource definitions, missing fields, or API version mismatches, before they impact your live environment.
- Preview changes: Understand the objects that Kubernetes would create or modify during a real deployment.
- Integrate with CI/CD: Incorporate dry-run as a step in your continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to automate pre-deployment checks and prevent faulty deployments.

By providing this dry-run functionality, Meshery helps you increase the reliability and stability of your Kubernetes deployments by catching potential problems early in the development and deployment process.
&lt;!-- 
Assess your cloud native infrastructure configuration against deployment and operational best practices with Meshery&#039;s configuration validator. Manage your workloads with confidence. Check your Kubernetes configuration for anti-patterns and avoid common pitfalls. --&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

### Visually and collaboratively manage your infrastructure

Using a GitOps-centric approach, visually and collaboratively design and manage your infrastructure and microservices. Meshery intelligently infers the manner in which each resource [interrelates](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/relationships) with each other. Meshery supports a broad variety of built-in relationships between components, which you can use to create your own custom relationships.

&lt;img alt=&quot;Meshery and Open Policy Agent Integration&quot; src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-policies-2.png&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;text-align:center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage built-in relationships to enforce configuration best practices consistently from code to Kubernetes. Customize Configure your infrastructure with confidence without needing to know or write Open Policy Agent&#039;s Rego query language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

## Workspaces: Your team&#039;s Google Drive for cloud native projects

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/workspace.gif&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;

Workspaces let you organize your work and serve as the central point of collaboration for you and your teams and point of access control to Environments and their resources.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Manage your connections with Environments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/environments.gif&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/environments&quot;&gt;Environments&lt;/a&gt;  make it easier for you to manage, share, and work with a collection of resources as a group, instead of dealing with all your Connections and Credentials on an individual basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;See changes to your infra before you merge&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-snapshot.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --&gt;

## Platform Engineering with Meshery&#039;s Extension Points

Extend Meshery as your self-service engineering platform by taking advantage of its [vast set of extensibility features](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), including gRPC adapters, hot-loadable Reactjs packages and Golang plugins, subscriptions on NATS topics, consumable _and_ extendable API interfaces via REST and GraphQL.The great number of extension points in Meshery make it ideal as the foundation of your internal developer platform.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Access the Cloud Native Patterns for Kubernetes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design and manage all of your cloud native infrastructure using the design configurator in Meshery or start from a template using the patterns from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/catalog&quot;&gt;catalog&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/details&gt;

Meshery offers robust capabilities for managing multiple tenants within a shared Kubernetes infrastructure. Meshery provides the tools and integrations necessary to create a secure, isolated, and manageable multi-tenant environments, allowing multiple teams or organizations with granular control over their role-based access controls.

Meshery&#039;s &quot;multi-player&quot; functionality refers to its collaborative features that enable multiple users to interact with and manage cloud native infrastructure simultaneously. This is primarily facilitated through Kanvas, a Meshery extension visual designer and management interface.

## Performance Management

Meshery offers load generation and performance characterization to help you assess and optimize the performance of your applications and infrastructure.

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/performance-metrics.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create and reuse performance profiles for consistent characterization of the configuration of your infrastructure in context of how it performs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt; Manage the performance of your infrastructure and its workloads&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src = &quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-performance.gif&quot;&gt;

Baseline and track your cloud native performance from release to release.

- Use performance profiles to track the historical performance of your workloads.
- Track your application performance from version to version.
- Understand behavioral differences between cloud native network functions.
- Compare performance across infrastructure deployments.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Load Generation and Microservice Performance Characteristization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;picture align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layer5io/layer5/master/src/assets/images/service-mesh-performance/stacked/smp-light-text.svg&quot;  width=&quot;18%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:10px;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

- **Multiple Load Generators:** Meshery supports various load generators, including Fortio, Wrk2, and Nighthawk, allowing users to choose the tool that best suits your needs.
- **Configurable Performance Profiles:** Meshery provides a highly configurable set of load profiles with tunable facets, enabling users to generate TCP, gRPC, and HTTP load. You can customize parameters such as duration, concurrent threads, concurrent generators, and load generator type. 
- **Statistical Analysis:** Meshery performs statistical analysis on the results of performance tests, presenting data in the form of histograms with latency buckets. Understand the distribution of response times and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Comparison of Test Results:** Meshery enables you to compare the difference in request performance (latency and throughput) between independent performance tests. Save your load test configurations as Performance Profiles, making it easy to rerun tests with the same settings and track performance variations over time.
- **Kubernetes Cluster and Workload Metrics:** - Meshery connects to one or more Prometheus servers to gather both cluster and application metrics. Meshery also integrates with Grafana, allowing you to import your existing dashboards and visualize performance data.

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to produce infrastructure agnostic tooling, Meshery uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Performance&lt;/a&gt; specification as a common format to capture and measure your infrastructure&#039;s performance against a universal cloud native performance index. Meshery participates in advancing cloud native infrastructure adoption through the standardization of APIs. Meshery enables you to measure the value provided by Docker, Kubernetes, or other cloud native infrastructure in the context of the overhead incurred.&lt;/p&gt;

Beads provides a persistent, structured memory for coding agents. It replaces messy markdown plans with a dependency-aware graph, allowing agents to handle long-horizon tasks without losing context.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install beads CLI (system-wide - don&#039;t clone this repo into your project)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Initialize in YOUR project
cd your-project
bd init

# Tell your agent
echo &quot;Use &#039;bd&#039; for task tracking&quot; &gt;&gt; AGENTS.md
```

**Note:** Beads is a CLI tool you install once and use everywhere. You don&#039;t need to clone this repository into your project.

## 🛠 Features

* **Git as Database:** Issues stored as JSONL in `.beads/`. Versioned, branched, and merged like code.
* **Agent-Optimized:** JSON output, dependency tracking, and auto-ready task detection.
* **Zero Conflict:** Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) prevent merge collisions in multi-agent/multi-branch workflows.
* **Invisible Infrastructure:** SQLite local cache for speed; background daemon for auto-sync.
* **Compaction:** Semantic &quot;memory decay&quot; summarizes old closed tasks to save context window.
* **Messaging:** Message issue type with threading (`--thread`), ephemeral lifecycle, and mail delegation.
* **Graph Links:** `relates_to`, `duplicates`, `supersedes`, and `replies_to` for knowledge graphs.

## 📖 Essential Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers. |
| `bd create &quot;Title&quot; -p 0` | Create a P0 task. |
| `bd update &lt;id&gt; --claim` | Atomically claim a task (sets assignee + in_progress). |
| `bd dep add &lt;child&gt; &lt;parent&gt;` | Link tasks (blocks, related, parent-child). |
| `bd show &lt;id&gt;` | View task details and audit trail. |

## 🔗 Hierarchy &amp; Workflow

Beads supports hierarchical IDs for epics:

* `bd-a3f8` (Epic)
* `bd-a3f8.1` (Task)
* `bd-a3f8.1.1` (Sub-task)

**Stealth Mode:** Run `bd init --stealth` to use Beads locally without committing files to the main repo. Perfect for personal use on shared projects.

**Contributor vs Maintainer:** When working on open-source projects:

* **Contributors** (forked repos): Run `bd init --contributor` to route planning issues to a separate repo (e.g., `~/.beads-planning`). Keeps experimental work out of PRs.
* **Maintainers** (write access): Beads auto-detects maintainer role via SSH URLs or HTTPS with credentials. Only need `git config beads.role maintainer` if using GitHub HTTPS without credentials but you have write access.

## 📦 Installation

* **npm:** `npm install -g @beads/bd`
* **Homebrew:** `brew install beads`
* **Go:** `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`

**Requirements:** Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, or Windows.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MCP Toolbox for Databases is currently in beta, and may see breaking
&gt; changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

MCP Toolbox for Databases is an open source MCP server for databases. It enables
you to develop tools easier, faster, and more securely by handling the complexities
such as connection pooling, authentication, and more.

This README provides a brief overview. For comprehensive details, see the [full
documentation](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/).

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This solution was originally named “Gen AI Toolbox for Databases” as
&gt; its initial development predated MCP, but was renamed to align with recently
&gt; added MCP compatibility.

giving your AI the context it needs to handle the entire development lifecycle.

Here’s how it will save you time:

- **Query in Plain English**: Interact with your data using natural language
  right from your IDE. Ask complex questions like, *&quot;How many orders were
  delivered in 2024, and what items were in them?&quot;* without writing any SQL.
- **Automate Database Management**: Simply describe your data needs, and let the
  AI assistant manage your database for you. It can handle generating queries,
  creating tables, adding indexes, and more.
- **Generate Context-Aware Code**: Empower your AI assistant to generate
  application code and tests with a deep understanding of your real-time
  database schema.  This accelerates the development cycle by ensuring the
  generated code is directly usable.
- **Slash Development Overhead**: Radically reduce the time spent on manual
  setup and boilerplate. MCP Toolbox helps streamline lengthy database
  configurations, repetitive code, and error-prone schema migrations.

## General Architecture

Toolbox sits between your application&#039;s orchestration framework and your
database, providing a control plane that is used to modify, distribute, or
invoke tools. It simplifies the management of your tools by providing you with a
centralized location to store and update tools, allowing you to share tools
between agents and applications and update those tools without necessarily
redeploying your application.

This runs the latest version of the toolbox server with your configuration file.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This method should only be used for non-production use cases such as
&gt; experimentation. For any production use-cases, please consider [Installing the
&gt; server](#installing-the-server) and then [running it](#running-the-server).

### Installing the server

&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Container image&lt;/summary&gt;
You can also install Toolbox as a container:

```sh
# see releases page for other versions
export VERSION=0.26.0
docker pull us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:$VERSION
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Homebrew&lt;/summary&gt;

To install Toolbox using Homebrew on macOS or Linux:

```sh
brew install mcp-toolbox
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Compile from source&lt;/summary&gt;

To install from source, ensure you have the latest version of
[Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), and then run the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox@v0.26.0
```
&lt;!-- {x-release-please-end} --&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Gemini CLI Extensions&lt;/summary&gt;

To install Gemini CLI Extensions for MCP Toolbox, run the following command:

```sh
gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/mcp-toolbox
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Running the server

[Configure](#configuration) a `tools.yaml` to define your tools, and then
execute `toolbox` to start the server:

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Binary&lt;/summary&gt;

To run Toolbox from binary:

```sh
./toolbox --tools-file &quot;tools.yaml&quot;
```

&gt; ⓘ Note  
&gt; Toolbox enables dynamic reloading by default. To disable, use the
&gt; `--disable-reload` flag.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Container image&lt;/summary&gt;

To run the server after pulling the [container image](#installing-the-server):

```sh
export VERSION=0.24.0 # Use the version you pulled
docker run -p 5000:5000 \
-v $(pwd)/tools.yaml:/app/tools.yaml \
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:$VERSION \
--tools-file &quot;/app/tools.yaml&quot;
```

&gt; ⓘ Note  
&gt; The `-v` flag mounts your local `tools.yaml` into the container, and `-p` maps
&gt; the container&#039;s port `5000` to your host&#039;s port `5000`.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Source&lt;/summary&gt;

To run the server directly from source, navigate to the project root directory
and run:

```sh
go run .
```

&gt; ⓘ Note  
&gt; This command runs the project from source, and is more suitable for development
&gt; and testing. It does **not** compile a binary into your `$GOPATH`. If you want
&gt; to compile a binary instead, refer the [Developer
&gt; Documentation](./DEVELOPER.md#building-the-binary).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Homebrew&lt;/summary&gt;

If you installed Toolbox using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the `toolbox`
binary is available in your system path. You can start the server with the same
command:

```sh
toolbox --tools-file &quot;tools.yaml&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;NPM&lt;/summary&gt;

To run Toolbox directly without manually downloading the binary (requires Node.js):
```sh
npx @toolbox-sdk/server --tools-file tools.yaml
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Gemini CLI&lt;/summary&gt;

Interact with your custom tools using natural language. Check
[gemini-cli-extensions/mcp-toolbox](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/mcp-toolbox)
for more information.

&lt;/details&gt;

You can use `toolbox help` for a full list of flags! To stop the server, send a
terminate signal (`ctrl+c` on most platforms).

For more detailed documentation on deploying to different environments, check
out the resources in the [How-to
section](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/how-to/)

## Colima - container runtimes on macOS (and Linux) with minimal setup.

[![Go](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/actions/workflows/go.yml)
[![Integration](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/actions/workflows/integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/actions/workflows/integration.yml)

![Demonstration](colima.gif)

## Features

Support for Intel and Apple Silicon macOS, and Linux

- Simple CLI interface with sensible defaults
- Automatic Port Forwarding
- Volume mounts
- Multiple instances
- Support for multiple container runtimes
  - [Docker](https://docker.com) (with optional Kubernetes)
  - [Containerd](https://containerd.io) (with optional Kubernetes)
  - [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus) (containers and virtual machines)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Colima is available on Homebrew, MacPorts, Nix and [mise](http://github.com/jdx/mise). Check [here](docs/INSTALL.md) for other installation options.

```
# Homebrew
brew install colima

# MacPorts
sudo port install colima

# Nix
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.colima

# Mise
mise use -g colima@latest

```

Or stay on the bleeding edge (only Homebrew)

```
brew install --HEAD colima
```

### Upgrading

If upgrading from v0.5.6 or lower, it is required to start afresh by deleting existing instance.

```sh
colima delete # delete existing instance
colima start
```

## Usage

Start Colima with defaults

```
colima start
```

For more usage options

```
colima --help
colima start --help
```

Or use a config file

```
colima start --edit
```

## Using Templates
When you run the `colima template` command, Colima opens the default configuration in a temporary file using your editor (VS Code by default, if installed).

For example, you might see something like:
```sh
/var/folders/hm/xmq4vxs13dl2hx2jyct65r080000gn/T/colima-2758922589.yaml

```
You can edit this temporary file as needed. Once you save and close the file in the editor, Colima automatically overwrites the default template config located at:
```sh
~/.colima/_templates/default.yaml

```
To see more options for working with templates, run:
```
colima template --help

```

## Runtimes

On initial startup, Colima initiates with a user specified runtime that defaults to Docker.

### Docker

Docker client is required for Docker runtime. Installable with brew `brew install docker`.

You can use the `docker` client on macOS after `colima start` with no additional setup.

### Containerd

`colima start --runtime containerd` starts and setup Containerd. You can use `colima nerdctl` to interact with
Containerd using [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl).

It is recommended to run `colima nerdctl install` to install `nerdctl` alias script in $PATH.

### Kubernetes

kubectl is required for Kubernetes. Installable with `brew install kubectl`.

To enable Kubernetes, start Colima with `--kubernetes` flag.

```
colima start --kubernetes
```

#### Interacting with Image Registry

For Docker runtime, images built or pulled with Docker are accessible to Kubernetes.

For Containerd runtime, images built or pulled in the `k8s.io` namespace are accessible to Kubernetes.

### Incus

&lt;small&gt;**Requires v0.7.0**&lt;/small&gt;


Incus client is required for Incus runtime. Installable with brew `brew install incus`.

`colima start --runtime incus` starts and setup Incus.

You can use the `incus` client on macOS after `colima start` with no additional setup.

**Note:** Running virtual machines on Incus is only supported on m3 or newer Apple Silicon devices.

### None

&lt;small&gt;**Requires v0.7.0**&lt;/small&gt;

Colima can also be utilised solely as a headless virtual machine manager by specifying `none` runtime.


### Customizing the VM

The default VM created by Colima has 2 CPUs, 2GiB memory and 100GiB storage.

The VM can be customized either by passing additional flags to `colima start`.
e.g. `--cpu`, `--memory`, `--disk`, `--runtime`.
Or by editing the config file with `colima start --edit`.

**NOTE**: ~~disk size cannot be changed after the VM is created.~~ From v0.5.3, disk size can be increased.

#### Customization Examples

- create VM with 1CPU, 2GiB memory and 10GiB storage.

  ```
  colima start --cpu 1 --memory 2 --disk 10
  ```

- modify an existing VM to 4CPUs and 8GiB memory.

  ```
  colima stop
  colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8
  ```

- create VM with Rosetta 2 emulation. Requires v0.5.3 and macOS &gt;= 13 (Ventura) on Apple Silicon.

  ```
  colima start --vm-type=vz --vz-rosetta
  ```

## Project Goal

To provide container runtimes on macOS with minimal setup.

## What is with the name?

Colima means Containers on [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima).

Since Lima is aka Linux Machines. By transitivity, Colima can also mean Containers on Linux Machines.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Incus

Incus is a modern, secure and powerful system container and virtual machine manager.

&lt;!-- Include start Incus intro --&gt;

It provides a unified experience for running and managing full Linux systems inside containers or virtual machines. Incus supports images for a large number of Linux distributions (official Ubuntu images and images provided by the community) and is built around a very powerful, yet pretty simple, REST API. Incus scales from one instance on a single machine to a cluster in a full data center rack, making it suitable for running workloads both for development and in production.

Incus allows you to easily set up a system that feels like a small private cloud. You can run any type of workload in an efficient way while keeping your resources optimized.

You should consider using Incus if you want to containerize different environments or run virtual machines, or in general run and manage your infrastructure in a cost-effective way.

You can try Incus online at: [`https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/`](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/)

&lt;!-- Include end Incus intro --&gt;

## Project history
Incus, which is named after the [Cumulonimbus incus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_incus) or anvil cloud
started as a community fork of Canonical&#039;s LXD following [Canonical&#039;s takeover](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) of the LXD project from the
Linux Containers community.

The project was then adopted by the Linux Containers community, taking back the spot left empty by LXD&#039;s departure.

Incus is a true open source community project, free of any [CLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) and
remains released under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
It&#039;s maintained by the same team of developers that first created LXD.

LXD users wishing to migrate to Incus can easily do so through a migration tool called [`lxd-to-incus`](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/server_migrate_lxd/).

## Security

&lt;!-- Include start security --&gt;

Consider the following aspects to ensure that your Incus installation is secure:

- Keep your operating system up-to-date and install all available security patches.
- Use only supported Incus versions.
- Restrict access to the Incus daemon and the remote API.
- Do not use privileged containers unless required. If you use privileged containers, put appropriate security measures in place. See the [LXC security page](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/) for more information.
- Configure your network interfaces to be secure.
&lt;!-- Include end security --&gt;

See [Security](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/main/doc/explanation/security.md) for detailed information.

**IMPORTANT:**
&lt;!-- Include start security note --&gt;
Local access to Incus through the Unix socket always grants full access to Incus.
This includes the ability to attach file system paths or devices to any instance as well as tweak the security features on any instance.

Therefore, you should only give such access to users who you&#039;d trust with root access to your system.
&lt;!-- Include end security note --&gt;

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone&#039;s needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh1&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-a.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh2&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-b.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-a.example.com`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-b.example.com`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhostHTTPSPort`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;web&quot;
  type = &quot;http&quot;
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = [&quot;www.example.com&quot;]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;dns&quot;
  type = &quot;udp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  unixPath = &quot;/var/run/docker.sock&quot;
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_static_file&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;static_file&quot;
  localPath = &quot;/tmp/files&quot;
  stripPrefix = &quot;static&quot;
  httpUser = &quot;abc&quot;
  httpPassword = &quot;abc&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `localAddr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_https2http&quot;
  type = &quot;https&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;test.example.com&quot;]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;https2http&quot;
  localAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:80&quot;
  crtPath = &quot;./server.crt&quot;
  keyPath = &quot;./server.key&quot;
  hostHeaderRewrite = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = &quot;frp&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `secretKey` field for the preshared key, and that the `remotePort` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`secretKey` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn&#039;t work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

These configuration files is for reference only. Please do not use this configuration directly to run the program as it may have various issues.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps_full_example.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc_full_example.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go&#039;s standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}&quot;
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = {{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remember to prefix your reference with `.Envs`.

### Split Configures Into Different Files

You can split multiple proxy configs into different files and include them in the main file.

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
serverPort = 7000
includes = [&quot;./confd/*.toml&quot;]
```

```toml
# ./confd/test.toml

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localI

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most
painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across **all** the platforms and
architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and
Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.
This project has been
[forked](https://blog.gitea.com/welcome-to-gitea/) from
[Gogs](https://gogs.io) since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit [demo.gitea.com](https://demo.gitea.com).

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit [gitea.com](https://gitea.com/user/login).

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at [cloud.gitea.com](https://cloud.gitea.com).

## Documentation

You can find comprehensive documentation on our official [documentation website](https://docs.gitea.com/).

It includes installation, administration, usage, development, contributing guides, and more to help you get started and explore all features effectively.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to it, you can visit the [documentation repository](https://gitea.com/gitea/docs)

## Building

From the root of the source tree, run:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata&quot; make build

or if SQLite support is required:

    TAGS=&quot;bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify&quot; make build

The `build` target is split into two sub-targets:

- `make backend` which requires [Go Stable](https://go.dev/dl/), the required version is defined in [go.mod](/go.mod).
- `make frontend` which requires [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Internet connectivity is required to download the go and npm modules. When building from the official source tarballs which include pre-built frontend files, the `frontend` target will not be triggered, making it possible to build without Node.js.

More info: https://docs.gitea.com/installation/install-from-source

## Using

After building, a binary file named `gitea` will be generated in the root of the source tree by default. To run it, use:

    ./gitea web

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re interested in using our APIs, we have experimental support with [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/api).

## Contributing

Expected workflow is: Fork -&gt; Patch -&gt; Push -&gt; Pull Request

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; 1. **YOU MUST READ THE [CONTRIBUTORS GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md) BEFORE STARTING TO WORK ON A PULL REQUEST.**
&gt; 2. If you have found a vulnerability in the project, please write privately to **security@gitea.io**. Thanks!

## Translating

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/gitea/localized.svg)](https://translate.gitea.com)

Translations are done through [Crowdin](https://translate.gitea.com). If you want to translate to a new language, ask one of the managers in the Crowdin project to add a new language there.

You can also just create an issue for adding a language or ask on Discord on the #translation channel. If you need context or find some translation issues, you can leave a comment on the string or ask on Discord. For general translation questions there is a section in the docs. Currently a bit empty, but we hope to fill it as questions pop up.

Get more information from [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/contributing/localization).

## Official and Third-Party Projects

We provide an official [go-sdk](https://gitea.com/gitea/go-sdk), a CLI tool called [tea](https://gitea.com/gitea/tea) and an [action runner](https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner) for Gitea Action.

We maintain a list of Gitea-related projects at [gitea/awesome-gitea](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea), where you can discover more third-party projects, including SDKs, plugins, themes, and more.

## Elevator Pitch

Minor rant incoming: Something&#039;s not working? Maybe a service is down. `docker-compose ps`. Yep, it&#039;s that microservice that&#039;s still buggy. No issue, I&#039;ll just restart it: `docker-compose restart`. Okay now let&#039;s try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. `docker-compose ps`. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with `docker compose logs --follow myservice` but that dies everytime the service dies so I&#039;d need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run `docker-compose up myservice` and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just `up` it again, but now I&#039;ve got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do `ctrl+P,Q`, but... wait, that&#039;s not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can&#039;t remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service.

What a headache!

Memorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible. What if you had all the information you needed in one terminal window with every common command living one keypress away (and the ability to add custom commands as well). Lazydocker&#039;s goal is to make that dream a reality.

## Requirements

- Docker &gt;= **29.0.0** (API &gt;= **1.24**)
- Docker-Compose &gt;= **1.23.2** (optional)

## Installation

### Homebrew

Normally `lazydocker` formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you to tap our formula to get frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too.

**Tap**:
```sh
brew install jesseduffield/lazydocker/lazydocker
```

**Core**:
```sh
brew install lazydocker
```

### Scoop (Windows)

You can install `lazydocker` using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```sh
scoop install lazydocker
```
### Chocolatey (Windows)

You can install `lazydocker` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```sh
choco install lazydocker
```
### asdf-vm

You can install [asdf-lazydocker plugin](https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker) using [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/):
#### Setup (Once)
```sh
asdf plugin add lazydocker https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker.git
```

#### For Install / Upgrade
```sh
asdf list all lazydocker
asdf install lazydocker latest
asdf global lazydocker latest
```

### Binary Release (Linux/OSX/Windows)

You can manually download a binary release from [the release page](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/releases).

Automated install/update, don&#039;t forget to always verify what you&#039;re piping into bash:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/master/scripts/install_update_linux.sh | bash
```
The script installs downloaded binary to `$HOME/.local/bin` directory by default, but it can be changed by setting `DIR` environment variable.

### Go

Required Go Version &gt;= **1.19**

```sh
go install github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker@latest
```

Required Go version &gt;= **1.8**, &lt;= **1.17**

```sh
go get github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker
```

### Arch Linux AUR

You can install lazydocker using the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazydocker) by running:

```sh
yay -S lazydocker
```

    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

1. Run the container

    ```sh
    docker run --rm -it -v \
    /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /yourpath:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker \
    lazyteam/lazydocker
    ```

    - Don&#039;t forget to change `/yourpath` to an actual path you created to store lazydocker&#039;s config
    - You can also use this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
    - You might want to create an alias, for example:

        ```sh
        echo &quot;alias lzd=&#039;docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /yourpath/config:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker lazyteam/lazydocker&#039;&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
        ```



For development, you can build the image using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
cd lazydocker
docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \
    --build-arg BUILD_DATE=`date -u +&quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ&quot;` \
    --build-arg VCS_REF=`git rev-parse --short HEAD` \
    --build-arg VERSION=`git describe --abbrev=0 --tag` \
    .
```

If you encounter a compatibility issue with Docker bundled binary, try rebuilding
the image with the build argument `--build-arg DOCKER_VERSION=&quot;v$(docker -v | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev)&quot;`
so that the bundled docker binary matches your host docker binary version.

### Manual

You&#039;ll need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

```
git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git
cd lazydocker
go install
```

You can also use `go run main.go` to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)

## Usage

Call `lazydocker` in your terminal. I personally use this a lot so I&#039;ve made an alias for it like so:

```
echo &quot;alias lzd=&#039;lazydocker&#039;&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

(you can substitute .zshrc for whatever rc file you&#039;re using)

- List of keybindings
  [here](/docs/keybindings).

## Cool features

everything is one keypress away (or one click away! Mouse support FTW):

- viewing the state of your docker or docker-compose container environment at a glance
- viewing logs for a container/service
- viewing ascii graphs of your containers&#039; metrics so that you can not only feel but also look like a developer
- customising
