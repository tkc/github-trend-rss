----

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who&#039;s involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

----

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

## To start developing K8s

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```

For the full story, head over to the [developer&#039;s documentation].

## Support

If you need support, start with the [troubleshooting guide],
and work your way through the process that we&#039;ve outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us
[one way or another][communication].

# MinIO Quickstart Guide

[![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/minio/minio.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20V3-blue)](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE)

[![MinIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/.github/logo.svg?sanitize=true)](https://min.io)

MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage solution released under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license.
Designed for speed and scalability, it powers AI/ML, analytics, and data-intensive workloads with industry-leading performance.

- S3 API Compatible – Seamless integration with existing S3 tools
- Built for AI &amp; Analytics – Optimized for large-scale data pipelines
- High Performance – Ideal for demanding storage workloads.

This README provides instructions for building MinIO from source and deploying onto baremetal hardware.
Use the [MinIO Documentation](https://github.com/minio/docs) project to build and host a local copy of the documentation.

## MinIO is Open Source Software

We designed MinIO as Open Source software for the Open Source software community. We encourage the community to remix, redesign, and reshare MinIO under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

All usage of MinIO in your application stack requires validation against AGPLv3 obligations, which include but are not limited to the release of modified code to the community from which you have benefited. Any commercial/proprietary usage of the AGPLv3 software, including repackaging or reselling services/features, is done at your own risk.

The AGPLv3 provides no obligation by any party to support, maintain, or warranty the original or any modified work.
All support is provided on a best-effort basis through Github and our [Slack](https//slack.min.io) channel, and any member of the community is welcome to contribute and assist others in their usage of the software.

MinIO [AIStor](https://www.min.io/product/aistor) includes enterprise-grade support and licensing for workloads which require commercial or proprietary usage and production-level SLA/SLO-backed support. For more information, [reach out for a quote](https://min.io/pricing).

## Source-Only Distribution

**Important:** The MinIO community edition is now distributed as source code only. We will no longer provide pre-compiled binary releases for the community version.

### Installing Latest MinIO Community Edition

To use MinIO community edition, you have two options:

1. **Install from source** using `go install github.com/minio/minio@latest` (recommended)
2. **Build a Docker image** from the provided Dockerfile

See the sections below for detailed instructions on each method.

### Legacy Binary Releases

Historical pre-compiled binary releases remain available for reference but are no longer maintained:
- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/minio/minio/releases
- Direct downloads: https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/

**These legacy binaries will not receive updates.** We strongly recommend using source builds for access to the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates.

## Install from Source

Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source.
If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow [How to install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install). Minimum version required is [go1.24](https://golang.org/dl/#stable)

```sh
go install github.com/minio/minio@latest
```

You can alternatively run `go build` and use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to control the OS and architecture target.
For example:

```
env GOOS=linux GOARCh=arm64 go build
```

Start MinIO by running `minio server PATH` where `PATH` is any empty folder on your local filesystem.

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`.
You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.
Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials.
You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool:

```sh
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc admin info local
```

See [Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool.
For application developers, see &lt;https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/developers/sdk/&gt; to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Production environments using compiled-from-source MinIO binaries do so at their own risk.
&gt; The AGPLv3 license provides no warranties nor liabilites for any such usage.

## Build Docker Image

You can use the `docker build .` command to build a Docker image on your local host machine.
You must first [build MinIO](#install-from-source) and ensure the `minio` binary exists in the project root.

The following command builds the Docker image using the default `Dockerfile` in the root project directory with the repository and image tag `myminio:minio`

```sh
docker build -t myminio:minio .
```

Use `docker image ls` to confirm the image exists in your local repository.
You can run the server using standard Docker invocation:

```sh
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 myminio:minio server /tmp/minio --console-address :9001
```

Complete documentation for building Docker containers, managing custom images, or loading images into orchestration platforms is out of scope for this documentation.
You can modify the `Dockerfile` and `dockerscripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` as-needed to reflect your specific image requirements.

See the [MinIO Container](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/baremetal-deploy-minio-as-a-container.html#deploy-minio-container) documentation for more guidance on running MinIO within a Container image.

## Install using Helm Charts

There are two paths for installing MinIO onto Kubernetes infrastructure:

- Use the [MinIO Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator)
- Use the community-maintained [Helm charts](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/helm/minio)

See the [MinIO Documentation](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/kubernetes.html) for guidance on deploying using the Operator.
The Community Helm chart has instructions in the folder-level README.

## Test MinIO Connectivity

### Test using MinIO Console

MinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser.
Point your web browser to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; to ensure your server has started successfully.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use `--console-address` to pick a specific interface and port.

### Test using MinIO Client `mc`

`mc` provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services.

The following commands set a local alias, validate the server information, create a bucket, copy data to that bucket, and list the contents of the bucket.

```sh
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc admin info
mc mb data
mc cp ~/Downloads/mydata data/
mc ls data/
```

Follow the MinIO Client [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart) for further instructions.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](https://docs.ollama.com/import) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Generate embeddings from the CLI

```shell
ollama run embeddinggemma &quot;Your text to embed&quot;
```

You can also pipe text for scripted workflows:

```shell
echo &quot;Your text to embed&quot; | ollama run embeddinggemma
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

Or run with docker:

&gt; **💡 Docker Run vs Docker Start**
&gt; 
&gt; - `docker run` creates and starts a new container. If a container with the same name already exists, this command will fail.
&gt; - `docker start` starts an existing container that was previously created with `docker run`.
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#039;ve already run LocalAI before and want to start it again, use: `docker start -i local-ai`

containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.

containerd is a member of CNCF with [&#039;graduated&#039;](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=containerd) status.

containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being used directly by developers or end-users.

![architecture](docs/historical/design/architecture.png)

## Announcements

### containerd v2.0 is now released!
See [`docs/containerd-2.0.md`](docs/containerd-2.0.md).

### Now Recruiting

We are a large inclusive OSS project that is welcoming help of any kind shape or form:
* Documentation help is needed to make the product easier to consume and extend.
* We need OSS community outreach/organizing help to get the word out; manage
and create messaging and educational content; and help with social media, community forums/groups, and google groups.
* We are actively inviting new [security advisors](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#security-advisors) to join the team.
* New subprojects are being created, core and non-core that could use additional development help.
* Each of the [containerd projects](https://github.com/containerd) has a list of issues currently being worked on or that need help resolving.
  - If the issue has not already been assigned to someone or has not made recent progress, and you are interested, please inquire.
  - If you are interested in starting with a smaller/beginner-level issue, look for issues with an `exp/beginner` tag, for example [containerd/containerd beginner issues.](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aexp%2Fbeginner)

## Getting Started

See our documentation on [containerd.io](https://containerd.io):
* [for ops and admins](docs/ops.md)
* [namespaces](docs/namespaces.md)
* [client options](docs/client-opts.md)

To get started contributing to containerd, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are interested in trying out containerd see our example at [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Nightly builds

There are nightly builds available for download [here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/actions?query=workflow%3ANightly).
Binaries are generated from `main` branch every night for `Linux` and `Windows`.

Please be aware: nightly builds might have critical bugs, it&#039;s not recommended for use in production and no support provided.

## Kubernetes (k8s) CI Dashboard Group

The [k8s CI dashboard group for containerd](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd) contains test results regarding
the health of kubernetes when run against main and a number of containerd release branches.

- [containerd-periodics](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd-periodic)

## Runtime Requirements

Runtime requirements for containerd are very minimal. Most interactions with
the Linux and Windows container feature sets are handled via [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) and/or
OS-specific libraries (e.g. [hcsshim](https://github.com/Microsoft/hcsshim) for Microsoft).
The current required version of `runc` is described in [RUNC.md](docs/RUNC.md).

There are specific features
used by containerd core code and snapshotters that will require a minimum kernel
version on Linux. With the understood caveat of distro kernel versioning, a
reasonable starting point for Linux is a minimum 4.x kernel version.

The overlay filesystem snapshotter, used by default, uses features that were
finalized in the 4.x kernel series. If you choose to use btrfs, there may
be more flexibility in kernel version (minimum recommended is 3.18), but will
require the btrfs kernel module and btrfs tools to be installed on your Linux
distribution.

To use Linux checkpoint and restore features, you will need `criu` installed on
your system. See more details in [Checkpoint and Restore](#checkpoint-and-restore).

Build requirements for developers are listed in [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).


## Supported Registries

Any registry which is compliant with the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)
is supported by containerd.

For configuring registries, see [registry host configuration documentation](docs/hosts.md)

## Features

For a detailed overview of containerd&#039;s core concepts and the features it supports,
please refer to the [FEATURES.MD](./docs/features.md) document.

### Releases and API Stability

Please see [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for details on versioning and stability
of containerd components.

Downloadable 64-bit Intel/AMD binaries of all official releases are available on
our [releases page](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases).

For other architectures and distribution support, you will find that many
Linux distributions package their own containerd and provide it across several
architectures, such as [Canonical&#039;s Ubuntu packaging](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+package/containerd).

#### Enabling command auto-completion

Starting with containerd 1.4, the urfave client feature for auto-creation of bash and zsh
autocompletion data is enabled. To use the autocomplete feature in a bash shell for example, source
the autocomplete/ctr file in your `.bashrc`, or manually like:

```
$ source ./contrib/autocomplete/ctr
```

#### Distribution of `ctr` autocomplete for bash and zsh

For bash, copy the `contrib/autocomplete/ctr` script into
`/etc/bash_completion.d/` and rename it to `ctr`. The `zsh_autocomplete`
file is also available and can be used similarly for zsh users.

Provide documentation to users to `source` this file into their shell if
you don&#039;t place the autocomplete file in a location where it is automatically
loaded for the user&#039;s shell environment.

### CRI

`cri` is a [containerd](https://containerd.io/) plugin implementation of the Kubernetes [container runtime interface (CRI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api/blob/master/pkg/apis/runtime/v1/api.proto). With it, you are able to use containerd as the container runtime for a Kubernetes cluster.

![cri](./docs/cri/cri.png)

#### CRI Status

`cri` is a native plugin of containerd. Since containerd 1.1, the cri plugin is built into the release binaries and enabled by default.

The `cri` plugin has reached GA status, representing that it is:
* Feature complete
* Works with Kubernetes 1.10 and above
* Passes all [CRI validation tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/cri-validation.md).
* Passes all [node e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/e2e-node-tests.md).
* Passes all [e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/e2e-tests.md).

See results on the containerd k8s [test dashboard](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd)

#### Validating Your `cri` Setup
A Kubernetes incubator project, [cri-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools), includes programs for exercising CRI implementations. More importantly, cri-tools includes the program `critest` which is used for running [CRI Validation Testing](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/cri-validation.md).

#### CRI Guides
* [Installing with Ansible and Kubeadm](contrib/ansible/README.md)

- **Session-Based:** maintain multiple work sessions and contexts per project
- **LSP-Enhanced:** Crush uses LSPs for additional context, just like you do
- **Extensible:** add capabilities via MCPs (`http`, `stdio`, and `sse`)
- **Works Everywhere:** first-class support in every terminal on macOS, Linux, Windows (PowerShell and WSL), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD

## Installation

Use a package manager:

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install charmbracelet/tap/crush

# NPM
npm install -g @charmland/crush

# Arch Linux (btw)
yay -S crush-bin

# Nix
nix run github:numtide/nix-ai-tools#crush
```

Windows users:

```bash
# Winget
winget install charmbracelet.crush

# Scoop
scoop bucket add charm https://github.com/charmbracelet/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install crush
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nix (NUR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Crush is available via [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) in `nur.repos.charmbracelet.crush`.

You can also try out Crush via `nix-shell`:

```bash
# Add the NUR channel.
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/main.tar.gz nur
nix-channel --update

# Get Crush in a Nix shell.
nix-shell -p &#039;(import &lt;nur&gt; { pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}; }).repos.charmbracelet.crush&#039;
```

### NixOS &amp; Home Manager Module Usage via NUR

Crush provides NixOS and Home Manager modules via NUR.
You can use these modules directly in your flake by importing them from NUR. Since it auto detects whether its a home manager or nixos context you can use the import the exact same way :)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nur.url = &quot;github:nix-community/NUR&quot;;
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nur, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
      modules = [
        nur.modules.nixos.default
        nur.repos.charmbracelet.modules.crush
        {
          programs.crush = {
            enable = true;
            settings = {
              providers = {
                openai = {
                  id = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  name = &quot;OpenAI&quot;;
                  base_url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1&quot;;
                  type = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  api_key = &quot;sk-fake123456789abcdef...&quot;;
                  models = [
                    {
                      id = &quot;gpt-4&quot;;
                      name = &quot;GPT-4&quot;;
                    }
                  ];
                };
              };
              lsp = {
                go = { command = &quot;gopls&quot;; enabled = true; };
                nix = { command = &quot;nil&quot;; enabled = true; };
              };
              options = {
                context_paths = [ &quot;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&quot; ];
                tui = { compact_mode = true; };
                debug = false;
              };
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora/RHEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
echo &#039;[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key&#039; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

Or, download it:

```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Productivity may increase when using Crush and you may find yourself nerd
&gt; sniped when first using the application. If the symptoms persist, join the
&gt; [Discord][discord] and nerd snipe the rest of us.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, or OpenRouter and just start
Crush. You&#039;ll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

| Environment Variable        | Provider                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`         | Anthropic                                          |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`            | OpenAI                                             |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`        | OpenRouter                                         |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`            | Google Gemini                                      |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`          | Cerebras                                           |
| `HF_TOKEN`                  | Huggingface Inference                              |
| `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`          | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `VERTEXAI_LOCATION`         | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`              | Groq                                               |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`         | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`     | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_REGION`                | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_PROFILE`               | Amazon Bedrock (Custom Profile)                       |
| `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`  | Amazon Bedrock                                        |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI models                                |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`      | Azure OpenAI models (optional when using Entra ID) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`  | Azure OpenAI models                                |

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Catwalk Badge&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  &quot;this-setting&quot;: { &quot;this&quot;: &quot;that&quot; },
  &quot;that-setting&quot;: [&quot;ceci&quot;, &quot;cela&quot;]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;lsp&quot;: {
    &quot;go&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gopls&quot;,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GOTOOLCHAIN&quot;: &quot;go1.24.5&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;typescript&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;typescript-language-server&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;--stdio&quot;]
    },
    &quot;nix&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nil&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/mcp-server.js&quot;],
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NODE_ENV&quot;: &quot;production&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer $GH_PAT&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;streaming-service&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/sse&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;API-Key&quot;: &quot;$(echo $API_KEY)&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don&#039;t want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you&#039;d like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allowed_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;view&quot;,
      &quot;ls&quot;,
      &quot;grep&quot;,
      &quot;edit&quot;,
      &quot;mcp_context7_get-library-doc&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Initialization

When you initialize a project, Crush analyzes your codebase and creates
a context file that helps it work more effectively in future sessions.
By default, this file is named `AGENTS.md`, but you can customize the
name and location with the `initialize_as` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;initialize_as&quot;: &quot;AGENTS.md&quot;
  }
}
```

This is useful if you prefer a different naming convention or want to
place the file in a specific directory (e.g., `CRUSH.md` or
`docs/LLMs.md`). Crush will fill the file with project-specific context
like build commands, code patterns, and conventions it discovered during
initialization.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;attribution&quot;: {
      &quot;trailer_style&quot;: &quot;co-authored-by&quot;,
      &quot;generated_with&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

- `trailer_style`: Controls the attribution trailer added to commit messages
  (default: `assisted-by`)
	- `assisted-by`: Adds `Assisted-by: [Model Name] via Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	  (includes the model name)
	- `co-authored-by`: Adds `Co-Authored-By: Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	- `none`: No attribution trailer
- `generated_with`: When true (default), adds `💘 Generated with Crush` line to
  commit messages and PR descriptions

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Note that we support two &quot;types&quot; for OpenAI. Make sure to choose the right one
&gt; to ensure the best experience!
&gt; * `openai` should be used when proxying or routing requests through OpenAI.
&gt; * `openai-compat` should be used when using non-OpenAI providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don&#039;t forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;deepseek&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deepseek V3&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 0.27,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 0.07,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 64000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;custom-anthropic&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anthropic&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.anthropic.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;extra_headers&quot;: {
        &quot;anthropic-version&quot;: &quot;2023-06-01&quot;
      },
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Claude Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`
- Alternatively to `aws configure`, you can also just set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;vertexai&quot;: {
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4@20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VertexAI Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;ollama&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ollama&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen3:30b&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;lmstudio&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;LM Studio&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:1234/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;debug&quot;: true,
    &quot;debug_lsp&quot;: true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_provider_auto_update&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
crush update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
crush update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at crush at build time.
crush update-providers embedded

# For more info:
crush update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Crush records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code ([here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/blob/main/internal/llm/agent/event.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Or by setting the following in your config:

```json
{
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_metrics&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Crush also respects the [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://consoledonottrack.com)
convention which can be enabled via `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

&gt;*The modern internet built on public clouds is increasingly threatening your personal data privacy. As reliance on services like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Facebook grows, so does the risk to your digital autonomy. Your data lives on their servers, subject to their terms, tracking, and potential censorship.*
&gt;
&gt;*It&#039;s time for a change.* 

![Personal Cloud](https://app.cdn.olares.com/github/olares/public-cloud-to-personal-cloud.jpg)
We believe you have a fundamental right to control your digital life. The most effective way to uphold this right is by hosting your data locally, on your own hardware.

Olares is an **open-source personal cloud operating system** designed to empower you to own and manage your digital assets locally. Instead of relying on public cloud services, you can deploy powerful open-source alternatives locally on Olares, such as Ollama for hosting LLMs, ComfyUI for image generation, and Perplexica for private, AI-driven search and reasoning. Imagine the power of the cloud, but with you in complete command.

## The fastest way to build AI applications that never go down

Bifrost is a high-performance AI gateway that unifies access to 15+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, and more) through a single OpenAI-compatible API. Deploy in seconds with zero configuration and get automatic failover, load balancing, semantic caching, and enterprise-grade features.

## Quick Start

![Get started](./docs/media/getting-started.png)

**Go from zero to production-ready AI gateway in under a minute.**

**Step 1:** Start Bifrost Gateway

```bash
# Install and run locally
npx -y @maximhq/bifrost

# Or use Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 maximhq/bifrost
```

**Step 2:** Configure via Web UI

```bash
# Open the built-in web interface
open http://localhost:8080
```

**Step 3:** Make your first API call

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;openai/gpt-4o-mini&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, Bifrost!&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

**That&#039;s it!** Your AI gateway is running with a web interface for visual configuration, real-time monitoring, and analytics.

&lt;/div&gt;

Prometheus, a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics
from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,
displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

The features that distinguish Prometheus from other metrics and monitoring systems are:

* A **multi-dimensional** data model (time series defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)
* PromQL, a **powerful and flexible query language** to leverage this dimensionality
* No dependency on distributed storage; **single server nodes are autonomous**
* An HTTP **pull model** for time series collection
* **Pushing time series** is supported via an intermediary gateway for batch jobs
* Targets are discovered via **service discovery** or **static configuration**
* Multiple modes of **graphing and dashboarding support**
* Support for hierarchical and horizontal **federation**

## Architecture overview

![Architecture overview](documentation/images/architecture.svg)

## Install

There are various ways of installing Prometheus.

### Precompiled binaries

Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the
[*download* section](https://prometheus.io/download/)
on [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io). Using the latest production release binary
is the recommended way of installing Prometheus.
See the [Installing](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/install/)
chapter in the documentation for all the details.

### Docker images

Docker images are available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/).

You can launch a Prometheus container for trying it out with

```bash
docker run --name prometheus -d -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```

Prometheus will now be reachable at &lt;http://localhost:9090/&gt;.

### Building from source

To build Prometheus from source code, You need:

* Go: Version specified in [go.mod](./go.mod) or greater.
* NodeJS: Version specified in [.nvmrc](./web/ui/.nvmrc) or greater.
* npm: Version 8 or greater (check with `npm --version` and [here](https://www.npmjs.com/)).

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus.git
cd prometheus
```

You can use the `go` tool to build and install the `prometheus`
and `promtool` binaries into your `GOPATH`:

```bash
go install github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/...
prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml
```

*However*, when using `go install` to build Prometheus, Prometheus will expect to be able to
read its web assets from local filesystem directories under `web/ui/static` and
`web/ui/templates`. In order for these assets to be found, you will have to run Prometheus
from the root of the cloned repository. Note also that these directories do not include the
React UI unless it has been built explicitly using `make assets` or `make build`.

An example of the above configuration file can be found [here.](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml)

You can also build using `make build`, which will compile in the web assets so that
Prometheus can be run from anywhere:

```bash
make build
./prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml
```

The Makefile provides several targets:

* *build*: build the `prometheus` and `promtool` binaries (includes building and compiling in web assets)
* *test*: run the tests
* *test-short*: run the short tests
* *format*: format the source code
* *vet*: check the source code for common errors
* *assets*: build the React UI

### Service discovery plugins

Prometheus is bundled with many service discovery plugins.
When building Prometheus from source, you can edit the [plugins.yml](./plugins.yml)
file to disable some service discoveries. The file is a yaml-formatted list of go
import path that will be built into the Prometheus binary.

After you have changed the file, you
need to run `make build` again.

If you are using another method to compile Prometheus, `make plugins` will
generate the plugins file accordingly.

If you add out-of-tree plugins, which we do not endorse at the moment,
additional steps might be needed to adjust the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. As
always, be extra careful when loading third party code.

### Building the Docker image

You can build a docker image locally with the following commands:

```bash
make promu
promu crossbuild -p linux/amd64
make npm_licenses
make common-docker-amd64
```

The `make docker` target is intended only for use in our CI system and will not
produce a fully working image when run locally.

## Using Prometheus as a Go Library

### Remote Write

We are publishing our Remote Write protobuf independently at
[buf.build](https://buf.build/prometheus/prometheus/assets).

You can use that as a library:

```shell
go get buf.build/gen/go/prometheus/prometheus/protocolbuffers/go@latest
```

This is experimental.

### Prometheus code base

In order to comply with [go mod](https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions) rules,
Prometheus release number do not exactly match Go module releases.

For the
Prometheus v3.y.z releases, we are publishing equivalent v0.3y.z tags. The y in v0.3y.z is always padded to two digits, with a leading zero if needed.

Therefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v3.0.0 as a library could do:

```shell
go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.300.0
```

For the
Prometheus v2.y.z releases, we published the equivalent v0.y.z tags.

Therefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v2.35.0 as a library could do:

```shell
go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.35.0
```

This solution makes it clear that we might break our internal Go APIs between
minor user-facing releases, as [breaking changes are allowed in major version
zero](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

## React UI Development

For more information on building, running, and developing on the React-based UI, see the React app&#039;s [README.md](web/ui/README.md).

## More information

* Godoc documentation is available via [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/prometheus). Due to peculiarities of Go Modules, v3.y.z will be displayed as v0.3y.z (the y in v0.3y.z is always padded to two digits, with a leading zero if needed), while v2.y.z will be displayed as v0.y.z.
* See the [Community page](https://prometheus.io/community) for how to reach the Prometheus developers and users on various communication channels.

# MCP Go SDK

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

This repository contains an implementation of the official Go software
development kit (SDK) for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Package / Feature documentation

The SDK consists of several importable packages:

- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp)
  package defines the primary APIs for constructing and using MCP clients and
  servers.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc) package is for users implementing
  their own transports.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth)
  package provides some primitives for supporting OAuth.
- The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/oauthex)
  package provides extensions to the OAuth protocol, such as ProtectedResourceMetadata.

The SDK endeavors to implement the full MCP spec. The [`docs/`](/docs/) directory
contains feature documentation, mapping the MCP spec to the packages above.

## Getting started

To get started creating an MCP server, create an `mcp.Server` instance, add
features to it, and then run it over an `mcp.Transport`. For example, this
server adds a single simple tool, and then connects it to clients over
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

type Input struct {
	Name string `json:&quot;name&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the name of the person to greet&quot;`
}

type Output struct {
	Greeting string `json:&quot;greeting&quot; jsonschema:&quot;the greeting to tell to the user&quot;`
}

func SayHi(ctx context.Context, req *mcp.CallToolRequest, input Input) (
	*mcp.CallToolResult,
	Output,
	error,
) {
	return nil, Output{Greeting: &quot;Hi &quot; + input.Name}, nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a server with a single tool.
	server := mcp.NewServer(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;greeter&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)
	mcp.AddTool(server, &amp;mcp.Tool{Name: &quot;greet&quot;, Description: &quot;say hi&quot;}, SayHi)
	// Run the server over stdin/stdout, until the client disconnects.
	if err := server.Run(context.Background(), &amp;mcp.StdioTransport{}); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

To communicate with that server, create an `mcp.Client` and connect it to the
corresponding server, by running the server command and communicating over its
stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;os/exec&quot;

	&quot;github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp&quot;
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Create a new client, with no features.
	client := mcp.NewClient(&amp;mcp.Implementation{Name: &quot;mcp-client&quot;, Version: &quot;v1.0.0&quot;}, nil)

	// Connect to a server over stdin/stdout.
	transport := &amp;mcp.CommandTransport{Command: exec.Command(&quot;myserver&quot;)}
	session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	// Call a tool on the server.
	params := &amp;mcp.CallToolParams{
		Name:      &quot;greet&quot;,
		Arguments: map[string]any{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;you&quot;},
	}
	res, err := session.CallTool(ctx, params)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(&quot;CallTool failed: %v&quot;, err)
	}
	if res.IsError {
		log.Fatal(&quot;tool failed&quot;)
	}
	for _, c := range res.Content {
		log.Print(c.(*mcp.TextContent).Text)
	}
}
```

The [`examples/`](/examples/) directory contains more example clients and
servers.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cloudflare Tunnel client

Contains the command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel, a tunneling daemon that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins.
This daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a webserver). Cloudflare attracts client requests and sends them to you
via this daemon, without requiring you to poke holes on your firewall --- your origin can remain as closed as possible.
Extensive documentation can be found in the [Cloudflare Tunnel section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel) of the Cloudflare Docs.
All usages related with proxying to your origins are available under `cloudflared tunnel help`.

You can also use `cloudflared` to access Tunnel origins (that are protected with `cloudflared tunnel`) for TCP traffic
at Layer 4 (i.e., not HTTP/websocket), which is relevant for use cases such as SSH, RDP, etc.
Such usages are available under `cloudflared access help`.

You can instead use [WARP client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/)
to access private origins behind Tunnels for Layer 4 traffic without requiring `cloudflared access` commands on the client side.


## Before you get started

Before you use Cloudflare Tunnel, you&#039;ll need to complete a few steps in the Cloudflare dashboard: you need to add a
website to your Cloudflare account. Note that today it is possible to use Tunnel without a website (e.g. for private
routing), but for legacy reasons this requirement is still necessary:
1. [Add a website to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/)
2. [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/)


## Installing `cloudflared`

Downloads are available as standalone binaries, a Docker image, and Debian, RPM, and Homebrew packages. You can also find releases [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) on the `cloudflared` GitHub repository.

* You can [install on macOS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/#macos) via Homebrew or by downloading the [latest Darwin amd64 release](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases)
* Binaries, Debian, and RPM packages for Linux [can be found here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/#linux)
* A Docker image of `cloudflared` is [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared)
* You can install on Windows machines with the [steps here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/#windows)
* To build from source, install the required version of go, mentioned in the [Development](#development) section below. Then you can run `make cloudflared`.

User documentation for Cloudflare Tunnel can be found at https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/


## Creating Tunnels and routing traffic

Once installed, you can authenticate `cloudflared` into your Cloudflare account and begin creating Tunnels to serve traffic to your origins.

* Create a Tunnel with [these instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/)
* Route traffic to that Tunnel:
  * Via public [DNS records in Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/dns/)
  * Or via a public hostname guided by a [Cloudflare Load Balancer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/public-load-balancers/)
  * Or from [WARP client private traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/)


## TryCloudflare

Want to test Cloudflare Tunnel before adding a website to Cloudflare? You can do so with TryCloudflare using the documentation [available here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/).

## Deprecated versions

Cloudflare currently supports versions of cloudflared that are **within one year** of the most recent release. Breaking changes unrelated to feature availability may be introduced that will impact versions released more than one year ago. You can read more about upgrading cloudflared in our [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/update-cloudflared/).

For example, as of January 2023 Cloudflare will support cloudflared version 2023.1.1 to cloudflared 2022.1.1.

## Development

### Requirements
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [capnp](https://capnproto.org/install.html)
- [go &gt;= 1.24](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Optional tools:
  - [capnpc-go](https://pkg.go.dev/zombiezen.com/go/capnproto2/capnpc-go)
  - [goimports](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
  - [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
  - [gomocks](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/mock)

### Build
To build cloudflared locally run `make cloudflared`

### Test
To locally run the tests run `make test`

### Linting
To format the code and keep a good code quality use `make fmt` and `make lint`

### Mocks
After changes on interfaces you might need to regenerate the mocks, so run `make mock`

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 5.9. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 5.9 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | done | Done, though `tsconfig` errors may not be as helpful. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 5.9. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 5.9. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | in progress | Mostly complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit not complete. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled. |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps. |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Most functionality. More features coming soon. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.9, see CHANGES.md.

Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

* Documentation and Tutorials: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul]
* Forum: [Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/consul)

Consul provides several key features:

* **Multi-Datacenter** - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can
  support any number of regions without complex configuration.

* **Service Mesh** - Consul Service Mesh enables secure service-to-service
  communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Applications
  can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS
  connections for inbound and outbound connections with Transparent Proxy.

* **API Gateway** - Consul API Gateway manages access to services within Consul Service Mesh, 
  allow users to define traffic and authorization policies to services deployed within the mesh.  

* **Service Discovery** - Consul makes it simple for services to register
  themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface.
  External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.

* **Health Checking** - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert
  operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service
  discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service
  level circuit breakers.

* **Dynamic App Configuration** - An HTTP API that allows users to store indexed objects within Consul,
  for storing configuration parameters and application metadata.

Consul runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows and includes an
optional [browser based UI](https://demo.consul.io). A commercial version
called [Consul Enterprise](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/enterprise) is also
available.

**Please note**: We take Consul&#039;s security and our users&#039; trust very seriously. If you
believe you have found a security issue in Consul, please [responsibly disclose](https://www.hashicorp.com/security#vulnerability-reporting)
by contacting us at security@hashicorp.com.

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/go.mau.fi/whatsmeow.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/go.mau.fi/whatsmeow)

whatsmeow is a Go library for the WhatsApp web multidevice API.

## Discussion
Matrix room: [#whatsmeow:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#whatsmeow:maunium.net)

For questions about the WhatsApp protocol (like how to send a specific type of
message), you can also use the [WhatsApp protocol Q&amp;A] section on GitHub
discussions.

[WhatsApp protocol Q&amp;A]: https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow/discussions/categories/whatsapp-protocol-q-a

## Usage
The [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/go.mau.fi/whatsmeow) includes docs for all methods and event types.
There&#039;s also a [simple example](https://pkg.go.dev/go.mau.fi/whatsmeow#example-package) at the top.

## Features
Most core features are already present:

* Sending messages to private chats and groups (both text and media)
* Receiving all messages
* Managing groups and receiving group change events
* Joining via invite messages, using and creating invite links
* Sending and receiving typing notifications
* Sending and receiving delivery and read receipts
* Reading and writing app state (contact list, chat pin/mute status, etc)
* Sending and handling retry receipts if message decryption fails
* Sending status messages (experimental, may not work for large contact lists)

Things that are not yet implemented:

* Sending broadcast list messages (this is not supported on WhatsApp web either)
* Calls

Grafana Alloy is an open source OpenTelemetry Collector distribution with
built-in Prometheus pipelines and support for metrics, logs, traces, and
profiles.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/sources/assets/alloy_screenshot.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## What can Alloy do?

* **Programmable pipelines**: Use a rich [expression-based syntax][syntax] for
  configuring powerful observability pipelines.

* **OpenTelemetry Collector Distribution**: Alloy is a [distribution][] of
  OpenTelemetry Collector and supports dozens of its components, alongside new
  components that make use of Alloy&#039;s programmable pipelines.

* **Big tent**: Alloy embraces Grafana&#039;s &quot;big tent&quot; philosophy, where Alloy
  can be used with other vendors or open source databases. It has components
  to perfectly integrate with multiple telemetry ecosystems:

  * [OpenTelemetry Collector][]
  * [Prometheus][]
  * [Grafana Loki][]
  * [Grafana Pyroscope][]

* **Kubernetes-native**: Use components to interact with native and custom
  Kubernetes resources; no need to learn how to use a separate Kubernetes
  operator.

* **Shareable pipelines**: Use [modules][] to share your pipelines with the
  world.

* **Automatic workload distribution**: Configure Alloy instances to form a
  [cluster][] for automatic workload distribution.

* **Centralized configuration support**: Alloy supports retrieving its
  configuration from a [server][remotecfg] for centralized configuration
  management.

* **Debugging utilities**: Use the [built-in UI][ui] for visualizing and
  debugging pipelines.

# Quick Start #

## Quick Start for S3 API on Docker ##

`docker run -p 8333:8333 chrislusf/seaweedfs server -s3`

## Quick Start with Single Binary ##
* Download the latest binary from https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/releases and unzip a single binary file `weed` or `weed.exe`. Or run `go install github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed@latest`.
* `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin ; export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=key` as the admin credentials to access the object store.
* Run `weed server -dir=/some/data/dir -s3` to start one master, one volume server, one filer, and one S3 gateway.

Also, to increase capacity, just add more volume servers by running `weed volume -dir=&quot;/some/data/dir2&quot; -mserver=&quot;&lt;master_host&gt;:9333&quot; -port=8081` locally, or on a different machine, or on thousands of machines. That is it!

## Quick Start SeaweedFS S3 on AWS ##
* Setup fast production-ready [SeaweedFS S3 on AWS with cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nzelz5gprlrjc)

# Introduction #

SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

1. to store billions of files!
2. to serve the files fast!

SeaweedFS started as an Object Store to handle small files efficiently. 
Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, 
the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, 
and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. 
This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, 
allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation).

There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file&#039;s metadata. 
It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases.

SeaweedFS started by implementing [Facebook&#039;s Haystack design paper](http://www.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf). 
Also, SeaweedFS implements erasure coding with ideas from 
[f4: Facebook’s Warm BLOB Storage System](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-muralidhar.pdf), and has a lot of similarities with [Facebook’s Tectonic Filesystem](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast21-pan.pdf)

On top of the object store, optional [Filer] can support directories and POSIX attributes. 
Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, 
e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc.

For any distributed key value stores, the large values can be offloaded to SeaweedFS. 
With the fast access speed and linearly scalable capacity, 
SeaweedFS can work as a distributed [Key-Large-Value store][KeyLargeValueStore].

SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud. 
With hot data on local cluster, and warm data on the cloud with O(1) access time, 
SeaweedFS can achieve both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity.
What&#039;s more, the cloud storage access API cost is minimized. 
Faster and cheaper than direct cloud storage!

## Example: Using Seaweed Object Store ##

By default, the master node runs on port 9333, and the volume nodes run on port 8080.
Let&#039;s start one master node, and two volume nodes on port 8080 and 8081. Ideally, they should be started from different machines. We&#039;ll use localhost as an example.

SeaweedFS uses HTTP REST operations to read, write, and delete. The responses are in JSON or JSONP format.

### Start Master Server ###

```
&gt; ./weed master
```

### Start Volume Servers ###

```
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data1&quot; -max=5  -mserver=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8080 &amp;
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data2&quot; -max=10 -mserver=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8081 &amp;
```

### Write File ###

To upload a file: first, send a HTTP POST, PUT, or GET request to `/dir/assign` to get an `fid` and a volume server URL:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign
{&quot;count&quot;:1,&quot;fid&quot;:&quot;3,01637037d6&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;,&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}
```

Second, to store the file content, send a HTTP multi-part POST request to `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` from the response:

```
&gt; curl -F file=@/home/chris/myphoto.jpg http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;myphoto.jpg&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:43234,&quot;eTag&quot;:&quot;1cc0118e&quot;}
```

To update, send another POST request with updated file content.

For deletion, send an HTTP DELETE request to the same `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` URL:

```
&gt; curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
```

### Save File Id ###

Now, you can save the `fid`, 3,01637037d6 in this case, to a database field.

The number 3 at the start represents a volume id. After the comma, it&#039;s one file key, 01, and a file cookie, 637037d6.

The volume id is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The file key is an unsigned 64-bit integer. The file cookie is an unsigned 32-bit integer, used to prevent URL guessing.

The file key and file cookie are both coded in hex. You can store the &lt;volume id, file key, file cookie&gt; tuple in your own format, or simply store the `fid` as a string.

If stored as a string, in theory, you would need 8+1+16+8=33 bytes. A char(33) would be enough, if not more than enough, since most uses will not need 2^32 volumes.

If space is really a concern, you can store the file id in your own format. You would need one 4-byte integer for volume id, 8-byte long number for file key, and a 4-byte integer for the file cookie. So 16 bytes are more than enough.

### Read File ###

Here is an example of how to render the URL.

First look up the volume server&#039;s URLs by the file&#039;s volumeId:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/lookup?volumeId=3
{&quot;volumeId&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}]}
```

Since (usually) there are not too many volume servers, and volumes don&#039;t move often, you can cache the results most of the time. Depending on the replication type, one volume can have multiple replica locations. Just randomly pick one location to read.

Now you can take the public URL, render the URL or directly read from the volume server via URL:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
```

Notice we add a file extension &quot;.jpg&quot; here. It&#039;s optional and just one way for the client to specify the file content type.

If you want a nicer URL, you can use one of these alternative URL formats:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6/my_preferred_name.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6
```

If you want to get a scaled version of an image, you can add some params:

```
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fit
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fill
```

### Rack-Aware and Data Center-Aware Replication ###

SeaweedFS applies the replication strategy at a volume level. So, when you are getting a file id, you can specify the replication strategy. For example:

```
curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?replication=001
```

The replication parameter options are:

```
000: no replication
001: replicate once on the same rack
010: replicate once on a different rack, but same data center
100: replicate once on a different data center
200: replicate twice on two different data center
110: replicate once on a different rack, and once on a different data center
```

More details about replication can be found [on the wiki][Replication].

[Replication]: https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Replication

You can also set the default replication strategy when starting the master server.

### Allocate File Key on Specific Data Center ###

Volume servers can be started with a specific data center name:

```
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/1 -port=8080 -dataCenter=dc1
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/2 -port=8081 -dataCenter=dc2
```

When requesting a file key, an optional &quot;dataCenter&quot; parameter can limit the assigned volume to the specific data center. For example, this specifies that the assigned volume should be limited to &#039;dc1&#039;:

```
 http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?dataCenter=dc1
```

## Object Store Architecture ##

Usually distributed file systems split each file into chunks, a central master keeps a mapping of filenames, chunk indices to chunk handles, and also which chunks each chunk server has.

The main drawback is that the central master can&#039;t handle many small files efficiently, and since all read requests need to go through the chunk master, so it might not scale well for many concurrent users.

Instead of managing chunks, SeaweedFS manages data volumes in the master server. Each data volume is 32GB in size, and can hold a lot of files. And each storage node can have many data volumes. So the master node only needs to store the metadata about the volumes, which is a fairly small amount of data and is generally stable.

The actual file metadata is stored in each volume on volume servers. Since each volume server only manages metadata of files on its own disk, with only 16 bytes for each file, all file access can read file metadata just from memory and only needs one disk operation to actually read file data.

For comparison, consider that an xfs inode structure in Linux is 536 bytes.

### Master Server and Volume Server ###

The architecture is fairly simple. The actual data is stored in volumes on storage nodes. One volume server can have multiple volumes, and can both support read and write access with basic authentication.

All volumes are managed by a master server. The master server contains the volume id to volume server mapping. This is fairly static information, and can be easily cached.

On each write request, the master server also generates a file key, which is a growing 64-bit unsigned integer. Since write requests are not generally as frequent as read requests, one master server should be able to handle the concurrency well.

### Write and Read files ###

When a client sends a write request, the master server returns (volume id, file key, file cookie, volume node URL) for the file. The client then contacts the volume node and POSTs the file content.

When a client needs to read a file based on (volume id, file key, file cookie), it asks the master server by the volume id for t
