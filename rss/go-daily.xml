## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

## ✨ NEW ✨

### Google Gemini Multimodal Live support

Introducing support for the Gemini Multimodal Live feature. Here&#039;s an example
Multimodal Live server showing realtime conversation and video streaming:
[code](./examples/live/live_streaming_server.go)

# Google Gen AI Go SDK

The Google Gen AI Go SDK provides an interface for developers to integrate
Google&#039;s generative models into their Go applications. It supports the
[Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) and
[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/overview)
APIs.

The Google Gen AI Go SDK enables developers to use Google&#039;s state-of-the-art
generative AI models (like Gemini) to build AI-powered features and applications.
This SDK supports use cases like:
- Generate text from text-only input
- Generate text from text-and-images input (multimodal)
- ...

For example, with just a few lines of code, you can access Gemini&#039;s multimodal
capabilities to generate text from text-and-image input.

```go
parts := []*genai.Part{
  {Text: &quot;What&#039;s this image about?&quot;},
  {InlineData: &amp;genai.Blob{Data: imageBytes, MIMEType: &quot;image/jpeg&quot;}},
}
result, err := client.Models.GenerateContent(ctx, &quot;gemini-2.0-flash&quot;, []*genai.Content{{Parts: parts}}, nil)
```

## Installation and usage

Add the SDK to your module with `go get google.golang.org/genai`.

## Create Clients

### Imports
```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/genai&quot;
```

### Gemini API Client:
```go
client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, &amp;genai.ClientConfig{
	APIKey:   apiKey,
	Backend:  genai.BackendGeminiAPI,
})
```

### Vertex AI Client:
```go
client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, &amp;genai.ClientConfig{
	Project:  project,
	Location: location,
	Backend:  genai.BackendVertexAI,
})
```

# Introduction

restic is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure. It supports the three major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and a few smaller ones (FreeBSD, OpenBSD).

For detailed usage and installation instructions check out the [documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

You can ask questions in our [Discourse forum](https://forum.restic.net).

## Quick start

Once you&#039;ve [installed](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html) restic, start
off with creating a repository for your backups:

    $ restic init --repo /tmp/backup
    enter password for new backend:
    enter password again:
    created restic backend 085b3c76b9 at /tmp/backup
    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access the repository.
    Losing your password means that your data is irrecoverably lost.

and add some data:

    $ restic --repo /tmp/backup backup ~/work
    enter password for repository:
    scan [/home/user/work]
    scanned 764 directories, 1816 files in 0:00
    [0:29] 100.00%  54.732 MiB/s  1.582 GiB / 1.582 GiB  2580 / 2580 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
    duration: 0:29, 54.47MiB/s
    snapshot 40dc1520 saved

Next you can either use `restic restore` to restore files or use `restic
mount` to mount the repository via fuse and browse the files from previous
snapshots.

For more options check out the [online documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Backends

Saving a backup on the same machine is nice but not a real backup strategy.
Therefore, restic supports the following backends for storing backups natively:

- [Local directory](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#local)
- [sftp server (via SSH)](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#sftp)
- [HTTP REST server](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server) ([protocol](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#rest-backend), [rest-server](https://github.com/restic/rest-server))
- [Amazon S3](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#amazon-s3) (either from Amazon or using the [Minio](https://minio.io) server)
- [OpenStack Swift](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#openstack-swift)
- [BackBlaze B2](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#backblaze-b2)
- [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#microsoft-azure-blob-storage)
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#google-cloud-storage)
- And many other services via the [rclone](https://rclone.org) [Backend](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#other-services-via-rclone)

# Design Principles

Restic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the
following principles in mind:

-  **Easy**: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise
   you might be tempted to skip it. Restic should be easy to configure
   and use, so that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore
   it. Likewise, restoring data should not be complicated.

-  **Fast**: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by
   your network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files
   every day. Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring
   backups should only transfer data that is needed for the files that
   are to be restored, so that this process is also fast.

-  **Verifiable**: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic
   enables you to easily verify that all data can be restored.

-  **Secure**: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and
   integrity of your data. The location the backup data is stored is
   assumed not to be a trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where
   others like system administrators are able to access your backups).
   Restic is built to secure your data against such attackers.

-  **Efficient**: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should
   only take the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate
   data should be de-duplicated before it is actually written to the
   storage back end to save precious backup space.

# Reproducible Builds

The binaries released with each restic version starting at 0.6.1 are
[reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can
reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that
release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the
[builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).

## Overview

This repository contains the majority of Tailscale&#039;s open source code.
Notably, it includes the `tailscaled` daemon and
the `tailscale` CLI tool. The `tailscaled` daemon runs on Linux, Windows,
[macOS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants/), and to varying degrees
on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The Tailscale iOS and Android apps use this repo&#039;s
code, but this repo doesn&#039;t contain the mobile GUI code.

Other [Tailscale repos](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/repositories) of note:

* the Android app is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android
* the Synology package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology
* the QNAP package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-qpkg
* the Chocolatey packaging is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-chocolatey

For background on which parts of Tailscale are open source and why,
see [https://tailscale.com/opensource/](https://tailscale.com/opensource/).

## Using

We serve packages for a variety of distros and platforms at
[https://pkgs.tailscale.com](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/).

## Other clients

The [macOS, iOS, and Windows clients](https://tailscale.com/download)
use the code in this repository but additionally include small GUI
wrappers. The GUI wrappers on non-open source platforms are themselves
not open source.

## Building

We always require the latest Go release, currently Go 1.23. (While we build
releases with our [Go fork](https://github.com/tailscale/go/), its use is not
required.)

```
go install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}
```

If you&#039;re packaging Tailscale for distribution, use `build_dist.sh`
instead, to burn commit IDs and version info into the binaries:

```
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
```

If your distro has conventions that preclude the use of
`build_dist.sh`, please do the equivalent of what it does in your
distro&#039;s way, so that bug reports contain useful version information.

## Bugs

Please file any issues about this code or the hosted service on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).

## Contributing

PRs welcome! But please file bugs. Commit messages should [reference
bugs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls).

We require [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
`Signed-off-by` lines in commits.

See [commit-messages.md](docs/commit-messages.md) (or skim `git log`) for our commit message style.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># MCPHost 🤖

A CLI host application that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Currently supports both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Ollama models.

Discuss the Project on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RqSS2NQVsY)

## Overview 🌟

MCPHost acts as a host in the MCP client-server architecture, where:
- **Hosts** (like MCPHost) are LLM applications that manage connections and interactions
- **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections with MCP servers
- **Servers** provide context, tools, and capabilities to the LLMs

This architecture allows language models to:
- Access external tools and data sources 🛠️
- Maintain consistent context across interactions 🔄
- Execute commands and retrieve information safely 🔒

Currently supports:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)
- Any Ollama-compatible model with function calling support
- Google Gemini models
- Any OpenAI-compatible local or online model with function calling support

## Features ✨

- Interactive conversations with support models
- Support for multiple concurrent MCP servers
- Dynamic tool discovery and integration
- Tool calling capabilities for both model types
- Configurable MCP server locations and arguments
- Consistent command interface across model types
- Configurable message history window for context management

## Requirements 📋

- Go 1.23 or later
- For Claude: An Anthropic API key
- For Ollama: Local Ollama installation with desired models
- For Google/Gemini: Google API key (see https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- One or more MCP-compatible tool servers

## Environment Setup 🔧

1. Anthropic API Key (for Claude):
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&#039;your-api-key&#039;
```

2. Ollama Setup:
- Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
- Pull your desired model:
```bash
ollama pull mistral
```
- Ensure Ollama is running:
```bash
ollama serve
```

You can also configure the Ollama client using standard environment variables, such as `OLLAMA HOST` for the Ollama base URL.

3. Google API Key (for Gemini):
```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=&#039;your-api-key&#039;
```

4. OpenAI compatible online Setup
- Get your api server base url, api key and model name

## Installation 📦

```bash
go install github.com/mark3labs/mcphost@latest
```

## Configuration ⚙️

### MCP-server
MCPHost will automatically create a configuration file at `~/.mcp.json` if it doesn&#039;t exist. You can also specify a custom location using the `--config` flag.

#### STDIO
The configuration for an STDIO MCP-server should be defined as the following:
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;sqlite&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;uvx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;mcp-server-sqlite&quot;,
        &quot;--db-path&quot;,
        &quot;/tmp/foo.db&quot;
      ]
    },
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem&quot;,
        &quot;/tmp&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each STDIO entry requires:
- `command`: The command to run (e.g., `uvx`, `npx`) 
- `args`: Array of arguments for the command:
  - For SQLite server: `mcp-server-sqlite` with database path
  - For filesystem server: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` with directory path

### Server Side Events (SSE) 

For SSE the following config should be used:
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;server_name&quot;: {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://some_jhost:8000/sse&quot;,
      &quot;headers&quot;:[
        &quot;Authorization: Bearer my-token&quot;
       ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each SSE entry requires:
- `url`: The URL where the MCP server is accessible. 
- `headers`: (Optional) Array of headers that will be attached to the requests

### System-Prompt

You can specify a custom system prompt using the `--system-prompt` flag. The system prompt should be a JSON file containing the instructions and context you want to provide to the model. For example:

```json
{
    &quot;systemPrompt&quot;: &quot;You&#039;re a cat. Name is Neko&quot;
}
```

Usage:
```bash
mcphost --system-prompt ./my-system-prompt.json
```


## Usage 🚀

MCPHost is a CLI tool that allows you to interact with various AI models through a unified interface. It supports various tools through MCP servers.

### Available Models
Models can be specified using the `--model` (`-m`) flag:
- Anthropic Claude (default): `anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`
- OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible: `openai:gpt-4`
- Ollama models: `ollama:modelname`
- Google: `google:gemini-2.0-flash`

### Examples
```bash
# Use Ollama with Qwen model
mcphost -m ollama:qwen2.5:3b

# Use OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4
mcphost -m openai:gpt-4

# Use OpenAI-compatible model
mcphost --model openai:&lt;your-model-name&gt; \
--openai-url &lt;your-base-url&gt; \
--openai-api-key &lt;your-api-key&gt;
```

### Flags
- `--anthropic-url string`: Base URL for Anthropic API (defaults to api.anthropic.com)
- `--anthropic-api-key string`: Anthropic API key (can also be set via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable)
- `--config string`: Config file location (default is $HOME/.mcp.json)
- `--system-prompt string`: system-prompt file location
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging
- `--message-window int`: Number of messages to keep in context (default: 10)
- `-m, --model string`: Model to use (format: provider:model) (default &quot;anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest&quot;)
- `--openai-url string`: Base URL for OpenAI API (defaults to api.openai.com)
- `--openai-api-key string`: OpenAI API key (can also be set via OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable)
- `--google-api-key string`: Google API key (can also be set via GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable)


### Interactive Commands

While chatting, you can use:
- `/help`: Show available commands
- `/tools`: List all available tools
- `/servers`: List configured MCP servers
- `/history`: Display conversation history
- `/quit`: Exit the application
- `Ctrl+C`: Exit at any time

### Global Flags
- `--config`: Specify custom config file location
- `--message-window`: Set number of messages to keep in context (default: 10)

## Quickstart (GKE)

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the latest major version.

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 --branch v0 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
   cd microservices-demo/
   ```

   The `--depth 1` argument skips downloading git history.

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.

4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

5. Deploy Online Boutique to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```

6. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

# About

[Fyne](https://fyne.io) is an easy-to-use UI toolkit and app API written in Go.
It is designed to build applications that run on desktop and mobile devices with a
single codebase.

# Prerequisites

To develop apps using Fyne you will need Go version 1.17 or later, a C compiler and your system&#039;s development tools.
If you&#039;re not sure if that&#039;s all installed or you don&#039;t know how then check out our
[Getting Started](https://fyne.io/develop/) document.

Using the standard go tools you can install Fyne&#039;s core library using:

    go get fyne.io/fyne/v2@latest

After importing a new module, run the following command before compiling the code for the first time. Avoid running it before writing code that uses the module to prevent accidental removal of dependencies:

    go mod tidy

# Widget demo

To run a showcase of the features of Fyne execute the following:

    go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo@latest
    fyne_demo

And you should see something like this (after you click a few buttons):

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-dark.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Dark Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Or if you are using the light theme:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-light.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Light Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

And even running on a mobile device:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-mobile-light.png&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Mobile Light Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

# Getting Started

Fyne is designed to be really easy to code with.
If you have followed the prerequisite steps above then all you need is a
Go IDE (or a text editor).

Open a new file and you&#039;re ready to write your first app!

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/app&quot;
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/container&quot;
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget&quot;
)

func main() {
	a := app.New()
	w := a.NewWindow(&quot;Hello&quot;)

	hello := widget.NewLabel(&quot;Hello Fyne!&quot;)
	w.SetContent(container.NewVBox(
		hello,
		widget.NewButton(&quot;Hi!&quot;, func() {
			hello.SetText(&quot;Welcome :)&quot;)
		}),
	))

	w.ShowAndRun()
}
```

And you can run that simply as:

    go run main.go

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; The first compilation of Fyne on Windows _can_ take up to 10 minutes, depending on your hardware. Subsequent builds will be fast.

It should look like this:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;img/hello-light.png&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Hello Dark Theme&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;img/hello-dark.png&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Hello Dark Theme&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Run in mobile simulation

There is a helpful mobile simulation mode that gives a hint of how your app would work on a mobile device:

    go run -tags mobile main.go

Another option is to use `fyne` command, see [Packaging for mobile](#packaging-for-mobile).

# Installing

Using `go install` will copy the executable into your go `bin` dir.
To install the application with icons etc into your operating system&#039;s standard
application location you can use the fyne utility and the &quot;install&quot; subcommand.

    go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne@latest
    fyne install

# Packaging for mobile

To run on a mobile device it is necessary to package up the application.
To do this we can use the fyne utility &quot;package&quot; subcommand.
You will need to add appropriate parameters as prompted, but the basic command is shown below.
Once packaged you can install using the platform development tools or the fyne &quot;install&quot; subcommand.

    fyne package -os android -appID my.domain.appname
    fyne install -os android

The built Android application can run either in a real device or an Android emulator.
However, building for iOS is slightly different.
If the &quot;-os&quot; argument is &quot;ios&quot;, it is build only for a real iOS device.
Specify &quot;-os&quot; to &quot;iossimulator&quot; allows the application be able to run in an iOS simulator:

    fyne package -os ios -appID my.domain.appname
    fyne package -os iossimulator -appID my.domain.appname

# Preparing a release

Using the fyne utility &quot;release&quot; subcommand you can package up your app for release
to app stores and market places. Make sure you have the standard build tools installed
and have followed the platform documentation for setting up accounts and signing.
Then you can execute something like the following, notice the `-os ios` parameter allows
building an iOS app from macOS computer. Other combinations work as well :)

    $ fyne release -os ios -certificate &quot;Apple Distribution&quot; -profile &quot;My App Distribution&quot; -appID &quot;com.example.myapp&quot;

The above command will create a &#039;.ipa&#039; file that can then be uploaded to the iOS App Store.

# Documentation

More documentation is available at the [Fyne developer website](https://developer.fyne.io/) or on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/fyne/v2?tab=doc).

# Examples

You can find many example applications in the [examples repository](https://github.com/fyne-io/examples/).
Alternatively a list of applications using fyne can be found at [our website](https://apps.fyne.io/).

# Shipping the Fyne Toolkit

All Fyne apps will work without pre-installed libraries, this is one reason the apps are so portable.
However, if looking to support Fyne in a bigger way on your operating system then you can install some utilities that help to make a more complete experience.

## Additional apps

It is recommended that you install the following additional apps:

| app           | go install                          | description                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fyne_settings | `fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_settings` | A GUI for managing your global Fyne settings like theme and scaling    |
| apps          | `github.com/fyne-io/apps`           | A graphical installer for the Fyne apps listed at https://apps.fyne.io |

These are optional applications but can help to create a more complete desktop experience.

## FyneDesk (Linux / BSD)

To go all the way with Fyne on your desktop / laptop computer you could install [FyneDesk](https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk) as well :)

**Authelia** is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single
sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. It acts as a companion for [reverse proxies](#proxy-support) by
allowing, denying, or redirecting requests.

Documentation is available at [https://www.authelia.com/](https://www.authelia.com/).

The following is a simple diagram of the architecture:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin:50px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.authelia.com/images/archi.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**Authelia** can be installed as a standalone service from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/authelia/),
[APT](https://apt.authelia.com/stable/debian/packages/authelia/),
[FreeBSD Ports](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/www/authelia/), or using a
[static binary](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest),
[.deb package](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest), as a container on [Docker] or [Kubernetes].


Deployment can be orchestrated via the Helm [Chart](https://charts.authelia.com) (beta) leveraging ingress controllers
and ingress configurations.

## Features summary

This is a list of the key features of Authelia:

* [OpenID Connect 1.0 / OAuth 2.0](#openid-connect-10--oauth-20)
* Several second factor methods:
  * **[Security Keys](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authentication/security-key/)** that support
    [FIDO2]&amp;nbsp;[WebAuthn] with devices like a [YubiKey].
  * **[Time-based One-Time password](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authentication/one-time-password/)**
    with compatible authenticator applications.
  * **[Mobile Push Notifications](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authentication/push-notification/)**
    with [Duo](https://duo.com/).
* Passwordless Authentication via WebAuthn (Passkeys)
* Password reset with identity verification using email confirmation.
* Access restriction after too many invalid authentication attempts.
* Fine-grained access control using rules which match criteria like subdomain, user, user group membership, request uri,
 request method, and network.
* Choice between one-factor and two-factor policies per-rule.
* Support of basic authentication for endpoints protected by the one-factor policy.
* Highly available using a remote database and Redis as a highly available KV store.
* Compatible with [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik) out of the box using the
  [ForwardAuth](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/forwardauth/) middleware.
* Curated configuration from [LinuxServer](https://www.linuxserver.io/) via their
  [SWAG](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag) container as well as a
  [guide](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2020/08/26/setting-up-authelia/).
* Compatible with [Caddy] using the [forward_auth](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/forward_auth)
  directive.
* Kubernetes Support:
  * Compatible with several Kubernetes ingress controllers:
    * [ingress-nginx](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/nginx-ingress/)
    * [Traefik Kubernetes CRD](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/traefik-ingress/#ingressroute)
    * [Traefik Kubernetes Ingress](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/traefik-ingress/#ingress)
    * [Istio](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/istio/)
  * Beta support for installing via Helm using our [Charts](https://charts.authelia.com).

### OpenID Connect 1.0 / OAuth 2.0

Authelia is [OpenID Certified™] to the Basic OP / Implicit OP / Hybrid OP / Form Post OP / Config OP profiles of the
[OpenID Connect™ protocol]. While this offering is still effectively
[on the roadmap as a beta](https://www.authelia.com/roadmap/active/openid-connect/) it&#039;s very comprehensive and well
implemented already, also allowing us comprehensive certification. Read more about the
[OpenID Certified™] status of Authelia in the
[OpenID Connect 1.0 Integration Guide](https://www.authelia.com/integration/openid-connect/introduction/#openid-certified).

&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting Started

See the [Get Started Guide](https://www.authelia.com/integration/prologue/get-started/) or one of the curated examples
below.

### docker compose

The `docker compose` bundles act as a starting point for anyone wanting to see Authelia in action. You will have to
customize them to your needs as they come with self-signed certificates.

#### [Local](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/#local)
The Local compose bundle is intended to test Authelia without worrying about configuration.
It&#039;s meant to be used for scenarios where the server is not be exposed to the internet.
Domains will be defined in the local hosts file and self-signed certificates will be utilised.

#### [Lite](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/#lite)
The Lite compose bundle is intended for scenarios where the server will be exposed to the internet, domains and DNS will
need to be setup accordingly and certificates will be generated through LetsEncrypt. The Lite element refers to minimal
external dependencies; File based user storage, SQLite based configuration storage. In this configuration, the service
will not scale well.

## Deployment

Now that you have tested **Authelia** and you want to try it out in your own infrastructure,
you can learn how to deploy and use it with [Deployment](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/introduction/).
This guide will show you how to deploy it on bare metal as well as on
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Security

Authelia takes security very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in Authelia, please see our

## Breaking changes

Since Authelia is still under active development, it is subject to breaking changes. It&#039;s recommended to pin a version
tag instead of using the `latest` tag and reading the [release notes](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases)
before upgrading. This is where you will find information about breaking changes and what you should do to overcome
said changes.

## Why Open Source?

You might wonder why Authelia is open source while it adds a great deal of security and user experience to your
infrastructure at zero cost. It is open source because we firmly believe that security should be available for all to
benefit in the face of the battlefield which is the Internet, with near zero effort.

Additionally, keeping the code open source is a way to leave it auditable by anyone who is willing to contribute. This
way, you can be confident that the product remains secure and does not act maliciously.

It&#039;s important to keep in mind Authelia is not directly exposed on the
Internet (your reverse proxies are) however, it&#039;s still the control plane for your internal security so take care of it!

**LocalAI** is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that&#039;s compatible with OpenAI (Elevenlabs, Anthropic... ) API specifications for local AI inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families. Does not require GPU. It is created and maintained by [Ettore Di Giacinto](https://github.com/mudler).

## What is Kubo?

Kubo was the first IPFS implementation and is the most widely used one today. Implementing the *Interplanetary Filesystem* - the standard for content-addressing on the Web, interoperable with HTTP. Thus powered by future-proof data models and the libp2p for network communication. Kubo is written in Go.

Featureset
- Runs an IPFS-Node as a network service that is part of LAN and WAN DHT
- Native support for UnixFS (most popular way to represent files and directories on IPFS)
- [HTTP Gateway](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/) (`/ipfs` and `/ipns`) functionality for trusted and [trustless](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trustless-verifiable-retrieval) content retrieval
- [HTTP Routing V1](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) (`/routing/v1`) client and server implementation for [delegated routing](./docs/delegated-routing.md) lookups
- [HTTP Kubo RPC API](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/rpc/) (`/api/v0`) to access and control the daemon
- [Command Line Interface](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/) based on (`/api/v0`) RPC API
- [WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/#readme) to manage the Kubo node
- [Content blocking](/docs/content-blocking.md) support for operators of public nodes

### Other implementations

See [List](https://docs.ipfs.tech/basics/ipfs-implementations/)

## What is IPFS?

IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines good ideas from previous systems such as Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web. It is like a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built-in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs.

For more info see: https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/

## Security Issues

Please follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Install

The canonical download instructions for IPFS are over at: https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/. It is **highly recommended** you follow those instructions if you are not interested in working on IPFS development.

For production use, Release Docker images (below) are recommended.

### Minimal System Requirements

Kubo runs on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. For optimal performance, we recommend at least 6 GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores (more is ideal, as Kubo is highly parallel).

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Larger pinsets require additional memory, with an estimated ~1 GiB of RAM per 20 million items for reproviding to the Amino DHT.

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Systems with less than the recommended memory may experience instability, frequent OOM errors or restarts, and missing data announcement (reprovider window), which can make data fully or partially inaccessible to other peers. Running Kubo on underprovisioned hardware is at your own risk.

### Docker

Official images are published at https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/: [![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ipfs/kubo?color=blue&amp;label=kubo%20docker%20image&amp;logo=docker&amp;sort=semver&amp;style=flat-square&amp;cacheSeconds=3600)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/)

#### 🟢 Release Images
  - These are production grade images. Use them.
  - `latest` and [`release`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/tags?name=release) tags always point at [the latest stable release](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/latest). If you use this, remember to `docker pull` periodically to update.
  - [`vN.N.N`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/tags?name=v) points at a specific [release tag](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases)

#### 🟠 Developer Preview Images
  - These tags are used by developers for internal testing, not intended for end users or production use.
  - [`master-latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/tags?name=master-latest) always points at the `HEAD` of the [`master`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/commits/master/) branch
  - [`master-YYYY-DD-MM-GITSHA`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/tags?name=master-2) points at a specific commit from the `master` branch

#### 🔴 Internal Staging Images
  - We use `staging` for testing arbitrary commits and experimental patches.
    - To build image for current HEAD, force push to `staging` via  `git push origin HEAD:staging --force`)
  - [`staging-latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/tags?name=staging-latest) always points at the `HEAD` of the [`staging`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/commits/staging/) branch
  - [`staging-YYYY-DD-MM-GITSHA`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/tags?name=staging-2) points at a specific commit from the `staging` branch

```console
$ docker pull ipfs/kubo:latest
$ docker run --rm -it --net=host ipfs/kubo:latest
```

To [customize your node](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/run-ipfs-inside-docker/#customizing-your-node),
pass necessary config via `-e` or by mounting scripts in the `/container-init.d`.

Learn more at https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/run-ipfs-inside-docker/

### Official prebuilt binaries

The official binaries are published at https://dist.ipfs.tech#kubo:

[![dist.ipfs.tech Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ipfs/kubo?label=dist.ipfs.tech&amp;logo=ipfs&amp;style=flat-square&amp;cacheSeconds=3600)](https://dist.ipfs.tech#kubo)

From there:
- Click the blue &quot;Download Kubo&quot; on the right side of the page.
- Open/extract the archive.
- Move kubo (`ipfs`) to your path (`install.sh` can do it for you).

If you are unable to access [dist.ipfs.tech](https://dist.ipfs.tech#kubo), you can also download kubo (go-ipfs) from:
- this project&#039;s GitHub [releases](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/latest) page
- `/ipns/dist.ipfs.tech` at [dweb.link](https://dweb.link/ipns/dist.ipfs.tech#kubo) gateway

#### Updating

##### Downloading builds using IPFS

List the available versions of Kubo (go-ipfs) implementation:

```console
$ ipfs cat /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/versions
```

Then, to view available builds for a version from the previous command (`$VERSION`):

```console
$ ipfs ls /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION
```

To download a given build of a version:

```console
$ ipfs get /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION/kubo_$VERSION_darwin-386.tar.gz    # darwin 32-bit build

```
where `&lt;&lt;DISTRO&gt;&gt;` is the codename of your Ubuntu distribution (for example, `jammy` for 22.04 LTS). During the first installation the package maintenance script may automatically ask you about which networking profile, CPU accounting model, and/or existing node configuration file you want to use.

**NOTE**: this method also may work with any compatible Debian-based distro which has `libc6` inside, and APT as a package manager.

### Unofficial Windows packages

- [Chocolatey](#chocolatey)
- [Scoop](#scoop)

#### Chocolatey

No longer supported, see rationale in [kubo#9341](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9341).

#### Scoop

Scoop provides kubo as `kubo` in its &#039;extras&#039; bucket.

```Powershell

PS&gt; scoop install kubo
```

### Unofficial macOS packages

- [MacPorts](#macports)
- [Nix](#nix-macos)
- [Homebrew](#homebrew)

#### MacPorts

The package [ipfs](https://ports.macports.org/port/ipfs) currently points to kubo (go-ipfs) and is being maintained.

```
$ sudo port install ipfs
```

#### &lt;a name=&quot;nix-macos&quot;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;

In macOS you can use the purely functional package manager [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/):

```
$ nix-env -i kubo
```

You can also install the Package by using its attribute name, which is also `kubo`.

#### Homebrew

A Homebrew formula [ipfs](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ipfs) is maintained too.

```
$ brew install --formula ipfs
```

### Build from Source

![GitHub go.mod Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/ipfs/kubo?label=Requires%20Go&amp;logo=go&amp;style=flat-square&amp;cacheSeconds=3600)

kubo&#039;s build system requires Go and some standard POSIX build tools:

* GNU make
* Git
* GCC (or some other go compatible C Compiler) (optional)

To build without GCC, build with `CGO_ENABLED=0` (e.g., `make build CGO_ENABLED=0`).

#### Install Go

![GitHub go.mod Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/ipfs/kubo?label=Requires%20Go&amp;logo=go&amp;style=flat-square&amp;cacheSeconds=3600)

If you need to update: [Download latest version of Go](https://golang.org/dl/).

You&#039;ll need to add Go&#039;s bin directories to your `$PATH` environment variable e.g., by adding these lines to your `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation) or `$HOME/.profile`:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

(If you run into trouble, see the [Go install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)).

#### Download and Compile IPFS

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ipfs/kubo.git

$ cd kubo
$ make install
```

Alternatively, you can run `make build` to build the go-ipfs binary (storing it in `cmd/ipfs/ipfs`) without installing it.

**NOTE:** If you get an error along the lines of &quot;fatal error: stdlib.h: No such file or directory&quot;, you&#039;re missing a C compiler. Either re-run `make` with `CGO_ENABLED=0` or install GCC.

##### Cross Compiling

Compiling for a different platform is as simple as running:

```
make build GOOS=myTargetOS GOARCH=myTargetArchitecture
```

#### Troubleshooting

- Separate [instructions are available for building on Windows](docs/windows.md).
- `git` is required in order for `go get` to fetch all dependencies.
- Package managers often contain out-of-date `golang` packages.
  Ensure that `go version` reports at least 1.10. See above for how to install go.
- If you are interested in development, please install the development
dependencies as well.
- Shell command completions can be generated with one of the `ipfs commands completion` subcommands. Read [docs/command-completion.md](docs/command-completion.md) to learn more.
- See the [misc folder](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/tree/master/misc) for how to connect IPFS to systemd or whatever init system your distro uses.

## Getting Started

### Usage

[![docs: Command-line quick start](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=docs&amp;message=Command-line%20quick%20start&amp;color=blue&amp;style=flat-square&amp;cacheSeconds=3600)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/command-line-quick-start/)
[![docs: Command-line reference](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=docs&amp;message=Command-line%20reference&amp;color=blue&amp;style=flat-square&amp;cacheSeconds=3600)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/)

To start using IPFS, you must first initialize IPFS&#039;s config files on your
system, this is done with `ipfs init`. See `ipfs init --help` for information on
the optional arguments it takes. After initialization is complete, you can use
`ipfs mount`, `ipfs add` and any of the other commands to explore!

### Some things to try

Basic proof of &#039;ipfs working&#039; locally:

    echo &quot;hello world&quot; &gt; hello
    ipfs add hello
    # This should output a hash string that looks something like:
    # QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
    ipfs cat &lt;that hash&gt;

### HTTP/RPC clients

For programmatic interaction with Kubo, see our [list of HTTP/RPC clients](docs/http-rpc-clients.md).

### Troubleshooting

If you have previously installed IPFS before and you are running into problems getting a newer version to work, try deleting (or backing up somewhere else) your IPFS config directory (~/.ipfs by default) and rerunning `ipfs init`. This will reinitialize the config file to its defaults and clear out the local datastore of any bad entries.

Please direct general questions and help requests to our [forums](https://discuss.ipfs.tech).

Ory Hydra is a hardened, **OpenID Certified OAuth 2.0 Server and OpenID Connect
Provider** optimized for low-latency, high throughput, and low resource
consumption. Ory Hydra _is not_ an identity provider (user sign up, user login,
password reset flow), but connects to your existing identity provider through a
[login and consent app](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/oauth2#authenticating-users-and-requesting-consent).
Implementing the login and consent app in a different language is easy, and
exemplary consent apps ([Node](https://github.com/ory/hydra-login-consent-node))
and [SDKs](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/sdk/index) for common languages are
provided.

Ory Hydra can use [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) as its identity
server.

## Ory Hydra on the Ory Network

The [Ory Network](https://www.ory.sh/cloud) is the fastest, most secure and
worry-free way to use Ory&#039;s Services. **Ory OAuth2 &amp; OpenID Connect** is powered
by the Ory Hydra open source federation server, and it&#039;s fully API-compatible.

The Ory Network provides the infrastructure for modern end-to-end security:

- Identity &amp; credential management scaling to billions of users and devices
- Registration, Login and Account management flows for passkey, biometric,
  social, SSO and multi-factor authentication
- **Pre-built login, registration and account management pages and components**
- **OAuth2 and OpenID provider for single sign on, API access and
  machine-to-machine authorization**
- Low-latency permission checks based on Google&#039;s Zanzibar model and with
  built-in support for the Ory Permission Language

It&#039;s fully managed, highly available, developer &amp; compliance-friendly!

- GDPR-friendly secure storage with data locality
- Cloud-native APIs, compatible with Ory&#039;s Open Source servers
- Comprehensive admin tools with the web-based Ory Console and the Ory Command
  Line Interface (CLI)
- Extensive documentation, straightforward examples and easy-to-follow guides
- Fair, usage-based [pricing](https://www.ory.sh/pricing)

**[website](https://www.ory.sh/support/)** or
**[book a meeting](https://www.ory.sh/contact/)**!

## Get Started

You can use
[Docker to run Ory Hydra locally](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/5min-tutorial)
or use the Ory CLI to try out Ory Hydra:

```shell
# This example works best in Bash
bash &lt;(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) -b . ory
sudo mv ./ory /usr/local/bin/

# Or with Homebrew installed
brew install ory/tap/cli
```

create a new project (you may also use
[Docker](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/5min-tutorial))

```
ory create project --name &quot;Ory Hydra 2.0 Example&quot;
project_id=&quot;{set to the id from output}&quot;
```

and follow the quick &amp; easy steps below.

### OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials / Machine-to-Machine

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client, and run the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow:

```shell
ory create oauth2-client --project $project_id \
    --name &quot;Client Credentials Demo&quot; \
    --grant-type client_credentials
client_id=&quot;{set to client id from output}&quot;
client_secret=&quot;{set to client secret from output}&quot;

### OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code + OpenID Connect

Try out the OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code grant right away!

By accepting permissions `openid` and `offline_access` at the consent screen,
Ory refreshes and OpenID Connect ID token,

```shell
ory create oauth2-client --project $project_id \
    --name &quot;Authorize Code with OpenID Connect Demo&quot; \
    --grant-type authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-type code \
    --redirect-uri http://127.0.0.1:4446/callback
code_client_id=&quot;{set to client id from output}&quot;
code_client_secret=&quot;{set to client secret from output}&quot;

ory perform authorization-code \
    --project $project_id \
    --client-id $code_client_id \
    --client-secret $code_client_secret
code_access_token=&quot;{set to access token from output}&quot;

ory introspect token $code_access_token --project $project_id
```

## What is Ory Hydra?

Ory Hydra is a server implementation of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework
and the OpenID Connect Core 1.0. Existing OAuth2 implementations usually ship as
libraries or SDKs such as
[node-oauth2-server](https://github.com/oauthjs/node-oauth2-server) or
[Ory Fosite](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues), or as fully featured
identity solutions with user management and user interfaces, such as
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org).

Implementing and using OAuth2 without understanding the whole specification is
challenging and prone to errors, even when SDKs are being used. The primary goal
of Ory Hydra is to make OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 better accessible.

Ory Hydra implements the flows described in OAuth2 and OpenID Connect 1.0
without forcing you to use a &quot;Hydra User Management&quot; or some template engine or
a predefined front-end. Instead, it relies on HTTP redirection and cryptographic
methods to verify user consent allowing you to use Ory Hydra with any
authentication endpoint, be it [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos),
[authboss](https://github.com/go-authboss/authboss),
[User Frosting](https://www.userfrosting.com/) or your proprietary Java
authentication.

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step [installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) for our self-hosted [community edition](https://link.photoprism.app/personal-editions) can be found on [docs.photoprism.app](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) - all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The [stable releases](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/) and [development preview](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/updates/#development-preview) are available as a [multi-arch image](https://link.photoprism.app/docker-hub) for 64-bit AMD, Intel, and ARM processors.
That means, [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/) and Apple Silicon users enjoy the exact same functionality and can follow the same [installation steps](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/).

See our [Getting Started FAQ](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-install-photoprism-without-docker) for alternative installation methods, for example using the [*tar.gz* packages](https://dl.photoprism.app/pkg/linux/README.html) we provide.

## Upcoming Features and Enhancements ##

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/photoprism/projects/5&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://dl.photoprism.app/img/ui/2025/upcoming-features-240px.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Our [Project Roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress and what features will be implemented next. You are invited to give ideas you like a thumbs-up, so we know what&#039;s most popular.

Be aware that we have a zero-bug policy and do our best to help users when they need support or have other questions. This comes at a price though, as we can&#039;t give exact release dates for new features. Our team receives many more requests than can be implemented, so we want to emphasize that we are in no way obligated to implement the features, enhancements, or other changes you request. We do, however, appreciate your feedback and carefully consider all requests.

**Because sustained funding is key to quickly releasing new features, we encourage you to support our mission by [signing up for a personal membership](https://link.photoprism.app/membership) or [purchasing a commercial license](https://www.photoprism.app/teams#compare).**

## GitHub Issues ⚠️ ##

We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app. Thank you for your careful consideration!

- When browsing issues, please note that **our team and all issue subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for [discussions, questions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions), or [expressing personal opinions](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct)
- In order for us to investigate [new bug reports](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs), they must include **a complete list of steps to reproduce the problem**, the software versions used and information about the environment in which the problem occurred, such as [browser type, browser version, browser plug-ins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [processor type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu), and [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory)
- [Contact us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives us the opportunity to [improve our documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support instead of dealing with unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by replying to comments

CoreDNS is a DNS server/forwarder, written in Go, that chains [plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins).
Each plugin performs a (DNS) function.

CoreDNS is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) graduated project.

CoreDNS is a fast and flexible DNS server. The key word here is *flexible*: with CoreDNS you
are able to do what you want with your DNS data by utilizing plugins. If some functionality is not
provided out of the box you can add it by [writing a plugin](https://coredns.io/explugins).

CoreDNS can listen for DNS requests coming in over:
* UDP/TCP (go&#039;old DNS).
* TLS - DoT ([RFC 7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)).
* DNS over HTTP/2 - DoH ([RFC 8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484)).
* DNS over QUIC - DoQ ([RFC 9250](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9250)). 
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io) (not a standard).

Currently CoreDNS is able to:

* Serve zone data from a file; both DNSSEC (NSEC only) and DNS are supported (*file* and *auto*).
* Retrieve zone data from primaries, i.e., act as a secondary server (AXFR only) (*secondary*).
* Sign zone data on-the-fly (*dnssec*).
* Load balancing of responses (*loadbalance*).
* Allow for zone transfers, i.e., act as a primary server (*file* + *transfer*).
* Automatically load zone files from disk (*auto*).
* Caching of DNS responses (*cache*).
* Use etcd as a backend (replacing [SkyDNS](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns)) (*etcd*).
* Use k8s (kubernetes) as a backend (*kubernetes*).
* Serve as a proxy to forward queries to some other (recursive) nameserver (*forward*).
* Provide metrics (by using Prometheus) (*prometheus*).
* Provide query (*log*) and error (*errors*) logging.
* Integrate with cloud providers (*route53*).
* Support the CH class: `version.bind` and friends (*chaos*).
* Support the RFC 5001 DNS name server identifier (NSID) option (*nsid*).
* Profiling support (*pprof*).
* Rewrite queries (qtype, qclass and qname) (*rewrite* and *template*).
* Block ANY queries (*any*).
* Provide DNS64 IPv6 Translation (*dns64*).

And more. Each of the plugins is documented. See [coredns.io/plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins)
for all in-tree plugins, and [coredns.io/explugins](https://coredns.io/explugins) for all
out-of-tree plugins.

## Compilation from Source

To compile CoreDNS, we assume you have a working Go setup. See various tutorials if you don’t have
that already configured.

First, make sure your golang version is 1.21 or higher as `go mod` support and other api is needed.
See [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for `go mod` details.
Then, check out the project and run `make` to compile the binary:

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/coredns/coredns
$ cd coredns
$ make
~~~

&gt; **_NOTE:_**  extra plugins may be enabled when building by setting the `COREDNS_PLUGINS` environment variable with comma separate list of plugins in the same format as plugin.cfg

This should yield a `coredns` binary.

## Compilation with Docker

CoreDNS requires Go to compile. However, if you already have docker installed and prefer not to
setup a Go environment, you could build CoreDNS easily:

```
docker run --rm -i -t \
    -v $PWD:/go/src/github.com/coredns/coredns -w /go/src/github.com/coredns/coredns \
        golang:1.22 sh -c &#039;GOFLAGS=&quot;-buildvcs=false&quot; make gen &amp;&amp; GOFLAGS=&quot;-buildvcs=false&quot; make&#039;
```

The above command alone will have `coredns` binary generated.

## Examples

When starting CoreDNS without any configuration, it loads the
[*whoami*](https://coredns.io/plugins/whoami) and [*log*](https://coredns.io/plugins/log) plugins
and starts listening on port 53 (override with `-dns.port`), it should show the following:

~~~ txt
.:53
CoreDNS-1.6.6
linux/amd64, go1.16.10, aa8c32
~~~

The following could be used to query the CoreDNS server that is running now:

~~~ txt
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 www.example.com
~~~

Any query sent to port 53 should return some information; your sending address, port and protocol
used. The query should also be logged to standard output.

The configuration of CoreDNS is done through a file named `Corefile`. When CoreDNS starts, it will
look for the `Corefile` from the current working directory. A `Corefile` for CoreDNS server that listens
on port `53` and enables `whoami` plugin is:

~~~ corefile
.:53 {
    whoami
}
~~~

Sometimes port number 53 is occupied by system processes. In that case you can start the CoreDNS server
while modifying the `Corefile` as given below so that the CoreDNS server starts on port 1053.

~~~ corefile
.:1053 {
    whoami
}
~~~

If you have a `Corefile` without a port number specified it will, by default, use port 53, but you can
override the port with the `-dns.port` flag: `coredns -dns.port 1053`, runs the server on port 1053.

You may import other text files into the `Corefile` using the _import_ directive.  You can use globs to match multiple
files with a single _import_ directive.

~~~ txt
.:53 {
    import example1.txt
}
import example2.txt
~~~

You can use environment variables in the `Corefile` with `{$VARIABLE}`.  Note that each environment variable is inserted
into the `Corefile` as a single token. For example, an environment variable with a space in it will be treated as a single
token, not as two separate tokens.

~~~ txt
.:53 {
    {$ENV_VAR}
}
~~~

A Corefile for a CoreDNS server that forward any queries to an upstream DNS (e.g., `8.8.8.8`) is as follows:

~~~ corefile
.:53 {
    forward . 8.8.8.8:53
    log
}
~~~

Start CoreDNS and then query on that port (53). The query should be forwarded to 8.8.8.8 and the
response will be returned. Each query should also show up in the log which is printed on standard
output.

To serve the (NSEC) DNSSEC-signed `example.org` on port 1053, with errors and logging sent to standard
output. Allow zone transfers to everybody, but specifically mention 1 IP address so that CoreDNS can
send notifies to it.

~~~ txt
example.org:1053 {
    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed
    transfer {
        to * 2001:500:8f::53
    }
    errors
    log
}
~~~

Serve `example.org` on port 1053, but forward everything that does *not* match `example.org` to a
recursive nameserver *and* rewrite ANY queries to HINFO.

~~~ txt
example.org:1053 {
    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed
    transfer {
        to * 2001:500:8f::53
    }
    errors
    log
}

. {
    any
    forward . 8.8.8.8:53
    errors
    log
}
~~~

IP addresses are also allowed. They are automatically converted to reverse zones:

~~~ corefile
10.0.0.0/24 {
    whoami
}
~~~
Means you are authoritative for `0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.`.

This also works for IPv6 addresses. If for some reason you want to serve a zone named `10.0.0.0/24`
add the closing dot: `10.0.0.0/24.` as this also stops the conversion.

This even works for CIDR (See RFC 1518 and 1519) addressing, i.e. `10.0.0.0/25`, CoreDNS will then
check if the `in-addr` request falls in the correct range.

Listening on TLS (DoT) and for gRPC? Use:

~~~ corefile
tls://example.org grpc://example.org {
    whoami
}
~~~

Similarly, for QUIC (DoQ):

~~~ corefile
quic://example.org {
    whoami
    tls mycert mykey
}
~~~

And for DNS over HTTP/2 (DoH) use:

~~~ corefile
https://example.org {
    whoami
    tls mycert mykey
}
~~~
in this setup, the CoreDNS will be responsible for TLS termination

you can also start DNS server serving DoH without TLS termination (plain HTTP), but beware that in such scenario there has to be some kind
of TLS termination proxy before CoreDNS instance, which forwards DNS requests otherwise clients will not be able to communicate via DoH with the server
~~~ corefile
https://example.org {
    whoami
}
~~~

Specifying ports works in the same way:

~~~ txt
grpc://example.org:1443 https://example.org:1444 {
    # ...
}
~~~

When no transport protocol is specified the default `dns://` is assumed.

## Contribution guidelines

If you want to contribute to CoreDNS, be sure to review the [contribution
guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Deployment

Examples for deployment via systemd and other use cases can be found in the [deployment
repository](https://github.com/coredns/deployment).

## Deprecation Policy

When there is a backwards incompatible change in CoreDNS the following process is followed:

*  Release x.y.z: Announce that in the next release we will make backward incompatible changes.
*  Release x.y+1.0: Increase the minor version and set the patch version to 0. Make the changes,
   but allow the old configuration to be parsed. I.e. CoreDNS will start from an unchanged
   Corefile.
*  Release x.y+1.1: Increase the patch version to 1. Remove the lenient parsing, so CoreDNS will
   not start if those features are still used.

E.g. 1.3.1 announce a change. 1.4.0 a new release with the change but backward compatible config.
And finally 1.4.1 that removes the config workarounds.

## About

PhoneInfoga is one of the most advanced tools to scan international phone numbers. It allows you to first gather basic information such as country, area, carrier and line type, then use various techniques to try to find the VoIP provider or identify the owner. It works with a collection of scanners that must be configured in order for the tool to be effective. PhoneInfoga doesn&#039;t automate everything, it&#039;s just there to help investigating on phone numbers.

## Current status

This project is stable and production-ready.

#### Demo instance termination

The demo instance has been terminated on December 21th, 2023. It&#039;s been expensive to maintain this instance throughout the years given the number of requests it received (~20K/month), without bringing much value to users compared to using it locally. Use it locally with your own API keys for a better experience.

## Features

- Check if phone number exists
- Gather basic information such as country, line type and carrier
- OSINT footprinting using external APIs, phone books &amp; search engines
- Check for reputation reports, social media, disposable numbers and more
- Use the graphical user interface to run scans from the browser
- Programmatic usage with the [REST API](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sundowndev/phoneinfoga/master/web/docs/swagger.yaml) and [Go modules](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sundowndev/phoneinfoga/v2)

## Anti-features

- Does not claim to provide relevant or verified data, it&#039;s just a tool !
- Does not allow to &quot;track&quot; a phone or its owner in real time
- Does not allow to get the precise phone location
- Does not allow to hack a phone

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it&#039;ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don&#039;t need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It&#039;s based on software we use for our public [AdGuard DNS] servers, and both share a lot of code.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison&quot; id=&quot;comparison&quot; name=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparing AdGuard Home to other solutions&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adguard-dns&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot;&gt;How is this different from public AdGuard DNS servers?&lt;/a&gt;

Running your own AdGuard Home server allows you to do much more than using a public DNS server. It&#039;s a completely different level. See for yourself:

- Choose what exactly the server blocks and permits.

- Monitor your network activity.

- Add your own custom filtering rules.

- **Most importantly, it&#039;s your own server, and you are the only one who&#039;s in control.**

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-pi-hole&quot; id=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot; name=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;

At this point, AdGuard Home has a lot in common with Pi-Hole. Both block ads and trackers using the so-called “DNS sinkholing” method and both allow customizing what&#039;s blocked.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We&#039;re not going to stop here. DNS sinkholing is not a bad starting point, but this is just the beginning.

AdGuard Home provides a lot of features out-of-the-box with no need to install and configure additional software. We want it to be simple to the point when even casual users can set it up with minimal effort.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Some of the listed features can be added to Pi-Hole by installing additional software or by manually using SSH terminal and reconfiguring one of the utilities Pi-Hole consists of. However, in our opinion, this cannot be legitimately counted as a Pi-Hole&#039;s feature.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adblock&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to traditional ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;

It depends.

DNS sinkholing is capable of blocking a big percentage of ads, but it lacks the flexibility and the power of traditional ad blockers. You can get a good impression about the difference between these methods by reading [this article][blog-adaway], which compares AdGuard for Android (a traditional ad blocker) to hosts-level ad blockers (which are almost identical to DNS-based blockers in their capabilities). This level of protection is enough for some users.

Additionally, using a DNS-based blocker can help to block ads, tracking and analytics requests on other types of devices, such as SmartTVs, smart speakers or other kinds of IoT devices (on which you can&#039;t install traditional ad blockers).

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-limitations&quot; id=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot; name=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot;&gt;Known limitations&lt;/a&gt;

Here are some examples of what cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker:

- YouTube, Twitch ads;

- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram sponsored posts.

Essentially, any advertising that shares a domain with content cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker.

Is there a chance to handle this in the future?  DNS will never be enough to do this. Our only option is to use a content blocking proxy like what we do in the standalone AdGuard applications. We&#039;re [going to bring][issue-1228] this feature support to AdGuard Home in the future. Unfortunately, even in this case, there still will be cases when this won&#039;t be enough or would require quite a complicated configuration.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#how-to-build&quot; id=&quot;how-to-build&quot; name=&quot;how-to-build&quot;&gt;How to build from source&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#prerequisites&quot; id=&quot;prerequisites&quot; name=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make init` to prepare the development environment.

You will need this to build AdGuard Home:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.24 or later;
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v20.19 or later;
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v10.8 or later;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#building&quot; id=&quot;building&quot; name=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt;

Open your terminal and execute these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome
cd AdGuardHome
make
```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The non-standard `-j` flag is currently not supported, so building with `make -j 4` or setting your `MAKEFLAGS` to include, for example, `-j 4` is likely to break the build. If you do have your `MAKEFLAGS` set to that, and you don&#039;t want to change it, you can override it by running `make -j 1`.

Check the [`Makefile`][src-makefile] to learn about other commands.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#building-cross&quot; id=&quot;building-cross&quot; name=&quot;building-cross&quot;&gt;Building for a different platform&lt;/a&gt;

You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports. In order to do this, specify `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables as macros when running `make`.

For example:

```sh
env GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039; make
```

or:

```sh
make GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039;
```

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#preparing-releases&quot; id=&quot;preparing-releases&quot; name=&quot;preparing-releases&quot;&gt;Preparing releases&lt;/a&gt;

You&#039;ll need [`snapcraft`] to prepare a release build. Once installed, run the following command:

```sh
make build-release CHANNEL=&#039;...&#039; VERSION=&#039;...&#039;
```

See the [`build-release` target documentation][targ-release].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#docker-image&quot; id=&quot;docker-image&quot; name=&quot;docker-image&quot;&gt;Docker image&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make build-docker` to build the Docker image locally (the one that we publish to DockerHub). Please note, that we&#039;re using [Docker Buildx][buildx] to build our official image.

You may need to prepare before using these builds:

- (Linux-only) Install Qemu:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes --credential yes
  ```

- Prepare the builder:

  ```sh
  docker buildx create --name buildx-builder --driver docker-container --use
  ```

See the [`build-docker` target documentation][targ-docker].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#debugging-the-frontend&quot; id=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot; name=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot;&gt;Debugging the frontend&lt;/a&gt;

When you need to debug the frontend without recompiling the production version every time, for example to check how your labels would look on a form, you can run the frontend build a development environment.

1. In a separate terminal, run:

   ```sh
   ( cd ./client/ &amp;&amp; env NODE_ENV=&#039;development&#039; npm run watch )
   ```

2. Run your `AdGuardHome` binary with the `--local-frontend` flag, which instructs AdGuard Home to ignore the built-in frontend files and use those from the `./build/` directory.

3. Now any changes you make in the `./client/` directory should be recompiled and become available on the web UI. Make sure that you disable the browser cache to make sure that you actually get the recompiled version.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#e2e-frontend-tests&quot; id=&quot;e2e-frontend-tests&quot; name=&quot;e2e-frontend-tests&quot;&gt;End-to-End (E2E) Frontend Tests&lt;/a&gt;

AdGuard Home uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for E2E testing. Tests are located in `tests/e2e`.

**Running Tests:**
- `npm run test:e2e` – run all tests (headless).
- `npm run test:e2e:interactive` – run tests interactively.
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` – run tests in debug mode.
- `npm run test:e2e:codegen` – generate new test code.

**Setup:**
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npx playwright install` to set up required browsers.

&gt; **Warning:** Playwright will download and install its own browser binaries for testing, which may differ from the browsers installed on your system.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#test-unstable-versions&quot; id=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot; name=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot;&gt;Test unstable versions&lt;/a&gt;

There are two update channels that you can use:

- `beta`: beta versions of AdGuard Home. More or less stable versions, usually released every two weeks or more often.

- `edge`: the newest version of AdGuard Home from the development branch. New updates are pushed to this channel daily.

There are three options how you can install an unstable version:

1. [Snap Store]: look for the `beta` and `edge` channels.

2. [Docker Hub]: look for the `beta` and `edge` tags.

3. Standalone builds. Use the automated installation script or look for the available builds [on the Wiki][wiki-platf].

   Script to install a beta version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c beta
   ```

   Script to install an edge version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c edge
   ```

## Benchmarks 

Some good benchmarks VictoriaMetrics achieved:

* **Minimal memory footprint**: handling millions of unique timeseries with [10x less RAM](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) than InfluxDB, up to [7x less RAM](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Highly scalable and performance** for [data ingestion](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and [querying](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4), [20x outperforms](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893) InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.
* **High data compression**: [70x more data points](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4) may be stored into limited storage than TimescaleDB, [7x less storage](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f) space is required than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
* **Reducing storage costs**: [10x more effective](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/casestudies/#grammarly) than Graphite according to the Grammarly case study.
* **A single-node VictoriaMetrics** can replace medium-sized clusters built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. See [VictoriaMetrics vs Thanos](https://medium.com/@valyala/comparing-thanos-to-victoriametrics-cluster-b193bea1683), [Measuring vertical scalability](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae), [Remote write storage wars - PromCon 2019](https://promcon.io/2019-munich/talks/remote-write-storage-wars/).
* **Optimized for storage**: [Works well with high-latency IO](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) and low IOPS (HDD and network storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.).

&lt;br/&gt;

💻  Plandex is a terminal-based AI development tool that can **plan and execute** large coding tasks that span many steps and touch dozens of files. It can handle up to 2M tokens of context directly (~100k per file), and can index directories with 20M tokens or more using tree-sitter project maps. 

🔬  **A cumulative diff review sandbox** keeps AI-generated changes separate from your project files until they are ready to go. Command execution is controlled so you can easily roll back and debug. Plandex helps you get the most out of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project.

🧠  **Combine the best models** from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and open source providers to build entire features and apps with a robust terminal-based workflow.

🚀  Plandex is capable of &lt;strong&gt;full autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;—it can load relevant files, plan and implement changes, execute commands, and automatically debug—but it&#039;s also highly flexible and configurable, giving developers fine-grained control and a step-by-step review process when needed.

💪  Plandex is designed to be resilient to &lt;strong&gt;large projects and files&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&#039;ve found that others tools struggle once your project gets past a certain size or the changes are too complex, give Plandex a shot.

## Smart context management that works in big projects

- 🐘 **2M token effective context window** with default model pack. Plandex loads only what&#039;s needed for each step.

- 🗄️ **Reliable in large projects and files.** Easily generate, review, revise, and apply changes spanning dozens of files.

- 🗺️ **Fast project map generation** and syntax validation with tree-sitter. Supports 30+ languages.

- 💰 **Context caching** is used across the board for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, reducing costs and latency.

## Tight control or full autonomy—it&#039;s up to you

- 🚦 **Configurable autonomy:** go from full auto mode to fine-grained control depending on the task.

- 🐞 **Automated debugging** of terminal commands (like builds, linters, tests, deployments, and scripts). If you have Chrome installed, you can also automatically debug browser applications.

## Tools that help you get production-ready results

- 💬 **A project-aware chat mode** that helps you flesh out ideas before moving to implementation. Also great for asking questions and learning about a codebase.

- 🧠 **Easily try + combine models** from multiple providers. Curated model packs offer different tradeoffs of capability, cost, and speed, as well as open source and provider-specific packs.

- 🛡️ **Reliable file edits** that prioritize correctness. While most edits are quick and cheap, Plandex validates both syntax and logic as needed, with multiple fallback layers when there are problems.

- 🔀 **Full-fledged version control** for every update to the plan, including branches for exploring multiple paths or comparing different models.

- 📂 **Git integration** with commit message generation and optional automatic commits.

## Dev-friendly, easy to install

- 🧑‍💻 **REPL mode** with fuzzy auto-complete for commands and file loading. Just run `plandex` in any project to get started.

- 🛠️ **CLI interface** for scripting or piping data into context.

- 📦 **One-line, zero dependency CLI install**. Dockerized local mode for easily self-hosting the server. Cloud-hosting options for extra reliability and convenience.

| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plandex Cloud (Integrated Models)** | • No separate accounts or API keys.&lt;br/&gt;• Easy multi-device usage.&lt;br/&gt;• Centralized billing, budgeting, usage tracking, and cost reporting.&lt;br/&gt;• Quickest way to [get started.](https://app.plandex.ai/start?modelsMode=integrated)                                                        |
| **Plandex Cloud (BYO API Key)**       | • Use Plandex Cloud with your own [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) key (and **optionally** your own [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) key).&lt;br/&gt;• [Get started](https://app.plandex.ai/start?modelsMode=byo)                                                                   |
| **Self-hosted/Local Mode**            | • Run Plandex locally with Docker or host on your own server.&lt;br/&gt;• Use your own [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) key (and **optionally** your own [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) key).&lt;br/&gt;• Follow the [local-mode quickstart](./hosting/self-hosting.md) to get started. |

## Provider keys  🔑

If you&#039;re going with a &#039;BYO API Key&#039; option above (whether cloud or self-hosted), you&#039;ll need to set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable before continuing:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
```

You can also **optionally** set a `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable if you want OpenAI models to use the OpenAI API directly instead of OpenRouter (for slightly lower latency and costs):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

&lt;br/&gt;

## Get started  🚀

First, `cd` into a **project directory** where you want to get something done or chat about the project. Make a new directory first with `mkdir your-project-dir` if you&#039;re starting on a new project.

```bash
cd your-project-dir
```

For a new project, you might also want to initialize a git repo. Plandex doesn&#039;t require that your project is in a git repo, but it does integrate well with git if you use it.

```bash
git init
```

Now start the Plandex REPL in your project:

```bash
plandex
```

or for short:

```bash
pdx
```

☁️ _If you&#039;re using Plandex Cloud, you&#039;ll be prompted at this point to start a trial._

Then just give the REPL help text a quick read, and you&#039;re ready go. The REPL starts in _chat mode_ by default, which is good for fleshing out ideas before moving to implementation. Once the task is clear, Plandex will prompt you to switch to _tell mode_ to make a detailed plan and start writing code.

evcc believes in open source software. We&#039;re committed to provide best in class EV charging experience.
Maintaining evcc consumes time and effort. With the vast amount of different devices to support, we depend on community and vendor support to keep evcc alive.

While evcc is open source, we would also like to encourage vendors to provide open source hardware devices, public documentation and support open source projects like ours that provide additional value to otherwise closed hardware. Where this is not the case, evcc requires &quot;sponsor token&quot; to finance ongoing development and support of evcc.
