## Interface Preview
![ui preview](./docs/images/ui_desktop.png)

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Basic Steps
First, download the Release executable file that matches your device&#039;s system. Follow the instructions below to choose between the desktop or non-desktop version, then place the software in an empty folder. Running the program will generate some directories, so keeping it in an empty folder makes management easier.

[For the desktop version (release files with &quot;desktop&quot; in the name), refer here]  
_The desktop version is newly released to address the difficulty beginners face in editing configuration files correctly. It still has some bugs and is being continuously updated._  

Double-click the file to start using it.

[For the non-desktop version (release files without &quot;desktop&quot; in the name), refer here]  
_The non-desktop version is the original release, with more complex configuration but stable functionality. It is also suitable for server deployment, as it provides a web-based UI._  

Create a `config` folder in the directory, then create a `config.toml` file inside it. Copy the contents of the `config-example.toml` file from the source code&#039;s `config` directory into your `config.toml` and fill in your configuration details. (If you want to use OpenAI models but don’t know how to get a key, you can join the group for free trial access.)

Double-click the executable or run it in the terminal to start the service.

Open your browser and enter http://127.0.0.1:8888 to begin using it. (Replace 8888 with the port number you specified in the config file.)

### To: macOS Users
[For the desktop version, i.e., release files with &quot;desktop&quot; in the name, refer here]  
The current packaging method for the desktop version cannot support direct double-click execution or DMG installation due to signing issues. Manual trust configuration is required as follows:

1. Open the directory containing the executable file (assuming the filename is KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64) in Terminal

2. Execute the following commands sequentially:

```
sudo xattr -cr ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64  
sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64  
./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64  
```

[For the non-desktop version, i.e., release files without &quot;desktop&quot; in the name, refer here]  
This software is not signed, so after completing the file configuration in the &quot;Basic Steps,&quot; you will need to manually trust the application on macOS. Follow these steps:
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is `KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64`) is located.
2. Execute the following commands in sequence:
```
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
```
This will start the service.

### Docker Deployment
This project supports Docker deployment. Please refer to the [Docker Deployment Instructions](./docs/docker.md).

### Cookie Configuration Instructions

If you encounter video download failures, please refer to the [Cookie Configuration Instructions](./docs/get_cookies.md) to configure your cookie information.

### Configuration Help
The quickest and most convenient configuration method:
* Select `openai` for both `transcription_provider` and `llm_provider`. In this way, you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` in the following three major configuration item categories, namely `openai`, `local_model`, and `aliyun`, and then you can conduct subtitle translation. (Fill in `app.proxy`, `model` and `openai.base_url` as per your own situation.)

The configuration method for using the local speech recognition model (macOS is not supported for the time being) (a choice that takes into account cost, speed, and quality):
* Fill in `fasterwhisper` for `transcription_provider` and `openai` for `llm_provider`. In this way, you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` and `local_model.faster_whisper` in the following three major configuration item categories, namely `openai` and `local_model`, and then you can conduct subtitle translation. The local model will be downloaded automatically. (The same applies to `app.proxy` and `openai.base_url` as mentioned above.)

The following usage situations require the configuration of Alibaba Cloud:
* If `llm_provider` is filled with `aliyun`, it indicates that the large model service of Alibaba Cloud will be used. Consequently, the configuration of the `aliyun.bailian` item needs to be set up.
* If `transcription_provider` is filled with `aliyun`, or if the &quot;voice dubbing&quot; function is enabled when starting a task, the voice service of Alibaba Cloud will be utilized. Therefore, the configuration of the `aliyun.speech` item needs to be filled in.
* If the &quot;voice dubbing&quot; function is enabled and local audio files are uploaded for voice timbre cloning at the same time, the OSS cloud storage service of Alibaba Cloud will also be used. Hence, the configuration of the `aliyun.oss` item needs to be filled in.
Configuration Guide: [Alibaba Cloud Configuration Instructions](./docs/aliyun.md)

## Frequently Asked Questions
Please refer to [Frequently Asked Questions](./docs/faq.md)

## Contribution Guidelines

- Do not submit unnecessary files like `.vscode`, `.idea`, etc. Please make good use of `.gitignore` to filter them.
- Do not submit `config.toml`; instead, submit `config-example.toml`.

[![MinIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/.github/logo.svg?sanitize=true)](https://min.io)

MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. It is API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. Use MinIO to build high performance infrastructure for machine learning, analytics and application data workloads. To learn more about what MinIO is doing for AI storage, go to [AI storage documentation](https://min.io/solutions/object-storage-for-ai).

This README provides quickstart instructions on running MinIO on bare metal hardware, including container-based installations. For Kubernetes environments, use the [MinIO Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator/blob/master/README.md).

## Container Installation

Use the following commands to run a standalone MinIO server as a container.

Standalone MinIO servers are best suited for early development and evaluation. Certain features such as versioning, object locking, and bucket replication
require distributed deploying MinIO with Erasure Coding. For extended development and production, deploy MinIO with Erasure Coding enabled - specifically,
with a *minimum* of 4 drives per MinIO server. See [MinIO Erasure Code Overview](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html)
for more complete documentation.

### Stable

Run the following command to run the latest stable image of MinIO as a container using an ephemeral data volume:

```sh
podman run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address &quot;:9001&quot;
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded
object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the
root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool. See
[Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool. For application developers,
see &lt;https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/developers/minio-drivers.html&gt; to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.

&gt; NOTE: To deploy MinIO on with persistent storage, you must map local persistent directories from the host OS to the container using the `podman -v` option. For example, `-v /mnt/data:/data` maps the host OS drive at `/mnt/data` to `/data` on the container.

## macOS

Use the following commands to run a standalone MinIO server on macOS.

Standalone MinIO servers are best suited for early development and evaluation. Certain features such as versioning, object locking, and bucket replication require distributed deploying MinIO with Erasure Coding. For extended development and production, deploy MinIO with Erasure Coding enabled - specifically, with a *minimum* of 4 drives per MinIO server. See [MinIO Erasure Code Overview](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html) for more complete documentation.

### Homebrew (recommended)

Run the following command to install the latest stable MinIO package using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Replace ``/data`` with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data.

```sh
brew install minio/stable/minio
minio server /data
```

&gt; NOTE: If you previously installed minio using `brew install minio` then it is recommended that you reinstall minio from `minio/stable/minio` official repo instead.

```sh
brew uninstall minio
brew install minio/stable/minio
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.

## Microsoft Windows

To run MinIO on 64-bit Windows hosts, download the MinIO executable from the following URL:

```sh
https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/windows-amd64/minio.exe
```

Use the following command to run a standalone MinIO server on the Windows host. Replace ``D:\`` with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data. You must change the terminal or powershell directory to the location of the ``minio.exe`` executable, *or* add the path to that directory to the system ``$PATH``:

```sh
minio.exe server D:\
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.

## Install from Source

Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source. Source installation is only intended for developers and advanced users. If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow [How to install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install). Minimum version required is [go1.24](https://golang.org/dl/#stable)

```sh
go install github.com/minio/minio@latest
```

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

See [MinIO Erasure Code Overview](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html) for more complete documentation.

MinIO strongly recommends *against* using compiled-from-source MinIO servers for production environments.

## Deployment Recommendations

### Allow port access for Firewalls

By default MinIO uses the port 9000 to listen for incoming connections. If your platform blocks the port by default, you may need to enable access to the port.

### ufw

For hosts with ufw enabled (Debian based distros), you can use `ufw` command to allow traffic to specific ports. Use below command to allow access to port 9000

```sh
ufw allow 9000
```

Below command enables all incoming traffic to ports ranging from 9000 to 9010.

```sh
ufw allow 9000:9010/tcp
```

### firewall-cmd

For hosts with firewall-cmd enabled (CentOS), you can use `firewall-cmd` command to allow traffic to specific ports. Use below commands to allow access to port 9000

```sh
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

This command gets the active zone(s). Now, apply port rules to the relevant zones returned above. For example if the zone is `public`, use

```sh
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9000/tcp --permanent
```

Note that `permanent` makes sure the rules are persistent across firewall start, restart or reload. Finally reload the firewall for changes to take effect.

```sh
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### iptables

For hosts with iptables enabled (RHEL, CentOS, etc), you can use `iptables` command to enable all traffic coming to specific ports. Use below command to allow
access to port 9000

```sh
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT
service iptables restart
```

Below command enables all incoming traffic to ports ranging from 9000 to 9010.

```sh
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9000:9010 -j ACCEPT
service iptables restart
```

## Test MinIO Connectivity

### Test using MinIO Console

MinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser. Point your web browser to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; to ensure your server has started successfully.

&gt; NOTE: MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use `--console-address` to pick a specific interface and port.

### Things to consider

MinIO redirects browser access requests to the configured server port (i.e. `127.0.0.1:9000`) to the configured Console port. MinIO uses the hostname or IP address specified in the request when building the redirect URL. The URL and port *must* be accessible by the client for the redirection to work.

For deployments behind a load balancer, proxy, or ingress rule where the MinIO host IP address or port is not public, use the `MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL` environment variable to specify the external hostname for the redirect. The LB/Proxy must have rules for directing traffic to the Console port specifically.

For example, consider a MinIO deployment behind a proxy `https://minio.example.net`, `https://console.minio.example.net` with rules for forwarding traffic on port :9000 and :9001 to MinIO and the MinIO Console respectively on the internal network. Set `MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL` to `https://console.minio.example.net` to ensure the browser receives a valid reachable URL.

## Test using MinIO Client `mc`

`mc` provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services. Follow the MinIO Client [Quickstart Guide](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart) for further instructions.

## Upgrading MinIO

Upgrades require zero downtime in MinIO, all upgrades are non-disruptive, all transactions on MinIO are atomic. So upgrading all the servers simultaneously is the recommended way to upgrade MinIO.

&gt; NOTE: requires internet access to update directly from &lt;https://dl.min.io&gt;, optionally you can host any mirrors at &lt;https://my-artifactory.example.com/minio/&gt;

- For deployments that installed the MinIO server binary by hand, use [`mc admin update`](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc-admin/mc-admin-update.html)

```sh
mc admin update &lt;minio alias, e.g., myminio&gt;
```

- For deployments without external internet access (e.g. airgapped environments), download the binary from &lt;https://dl.min.io&gt; and replace the existing MinIO binary let&#039;s say for example `/opt/bin/minio`, apply executable permissions `chmod +x /opt/bin/minio` and proceed to perform `mc admin service restart alias/`.

- For installations using Systemd MinIO service, upgrade via RPM/DEB packages **parallelly** on all servers or replace the binary lets say `/opt/bin/minio` on all nodes, apply executable permissions `chmod +x /opt/bin/minio` and process to perform `mc admin service restart alias/`.

### Upgrade Checklist

- Test all upgrades in a lower environment (DEV, QA, UAT) before applying to production. Performing blind upgrades in production environments carries significant risk.
- Read the release notes for MinIO *before* performing any upgrade, there is no forced requirement to upgrade to latest release upon every release. Some release may not be relevant to your setup, avoid upgrading production environments unnecessarily.
- If you plan to use `mc admin update`, MinIO process must have write access to the parent directory where the binary is present on the host system.
- `mc admin update` is not supported and should be avoided in kubernetes/container environments, please upgrade containers by upgrading relevant container images.
- **We do not recommend upgrading one MinIO server at a time, the product is designed to support parallel upgrades please follow our recommended guidelines.**

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Google Cloud Client Libraries for Go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/cloud.google.com/go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go)

Go packages for [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) services.

## Installation

```bash
go get cloud.google.com/go/firestore@latest # Replace firestore with the package you want to use.
```

**NOTE:** Some of these packages are under development, and may occasionally
make backwards-incompatible changes.

## Supported APIs

For an updated list of all of our released APIs please see our
[reference docs](https://cloud.google.com/go/docs/reference).

## [Go Versions Supported](#supported-versions)

Our libraries are compatible with the two most recent major Go
releases, the same [policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy) the Go
programming language follows. This means the currently supported versions are:

- Go 1.23
- Go 1.24

## Authentication

By default, each client library will use [Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials)
(ADC) to automatically configure the credentials used in calling the API endpoint.
When using the libraries in a Google Cloud Platform environment such as Compute
Engine, Kubernetes Engine, or App Engine, no additional authentication steps are
necessary. See [Authentication methods at Google](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication)
and [Authenticate for using client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/client-libraries)
for more information.

```go
client, err := storage.NewClient(ctx)
```

For applications running elsewhere, such as your local development environment,
you can use the `gcloud auth application-default login` command from the
[Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/cli) to set user credentials in
your local filesystem. Application Default Credentials will automatically detect
these credentials. See [Set up ADC for a local development
environment](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment)
for more information.

Alternately, you may need to provide an explicit path to your credentials. To authenticate
using a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#service-accounts)
key file, either set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path
to your key file, or programmatically pass
[`option.WithCredentialsFile`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option#WithCredentialsFile)
to the `NewClient` function of the desired package. For example:

```go
client, err := storage.NewClient(ctx, option.WithCredentialsFile(&quot;path/to/keyfile.json&quot;))
```

You can exert even more control over authentication by using the
[credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/auth/credentials) package to
create an [auth.Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/auth#Credentials).
Then pass [`option.WithAuthCredentials`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option#WithAuthCredentials)
to the `NewClient` function:

```go
creds, err := credentials.DetectDefault(&amp;credentials.DetectOptions{...})
...
client, err := storage.NewClient(ctx, option.WithAuthCredentials(creds))
```

Cobra is a library for creating powerful modern CLI applications.

Cobra is used in many Go projects such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) to
name a few. [This list](site/content/projects_using_cobra.md) contains a more extensive list of projects using Cobra.

# Overview

Cobra is a library providing a simple interface to create powerful modern CLI
interfaces similar to git &amp; go tools.

Cobra provides:
* Easy subcommand-based CLIs: `app server`, `app fetch`, etc.
* Fully POSIX-compliant flags (including short &amp; long versions)
* Nested subcommands
* Global, local and cascading flags
* Intelligent suggestions (`app srver`... did you mean `app server`?)
* Automatic help generation for commands and flags
* Grouping help for subcommands
* Automatic help flag recognition of `-h`, `--help`, etc.
* Automatically generated shell autocomplete for your application (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
* Automatically generated man pages for your application
* Command aliases so you can change things without breaking them
* The flexibility to define your own help, usage, etc.
* Optional seamless integration with [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for 12-factor apps

# Concepts

Cobra is built on a structure of commands, arguments &amp; flags.

**Commands** represent actions, **Args** are things and **Flags** are modifiers for those actions.

The best applications read like sentences when used, and as a result, users
intuitively know how to interact with them.

The pattern to follow is
`APPNAME VERB NOUN --ADJECTIVE`
    or
`APPNAME COMMAND ARG --FLAG`.

A few good real world examples may better illustrate this point.

In the following example, &#039;server&#039; is a command, and &#039;port&#039; is a flag:

    hugo server --port=1313

In this command we are telling Git to clone the url bare.

    git clone URL --bare

## Commands

Command is the central point of the application. Each interaction that
the application supports will be contained in a Command. A command can
have children commands and optionally run an action.

In the example above, &#039;server&#039; is the command.

[More about cobra.Command](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra#Command)

## Flags

A flag is a way to modify the behavior of a command. Cobra supports
fully POSIX-compliant flags as well as the Go [flag package](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/).
A Cobra command can define flags that persist through to children commands
and flags that are only available to that command.

In the example above, &#039;port&#039; is the flag.

Flag functionality is provided by the [pflag
library](https://github.com/spf13/pflag), a fork of the flag standard library
which maintains the same interface while adding POSIX compliance.

# Installing
Using Cobra is easy. First, use `go get` to install the latest version
of the library.

```
go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra@latest
```

Next, include Cobra in your application:

```go
import &quot;github.com/spf13/cobra&quot;
```

# Usage
`cobra-cli` is a command line program to generate cobra applications and command files.
It will bootstrap your application scaffolding to rapidly
develop a Cobra-based application. It is the easiest way to incorporate Cobra into your application.

It can be installed by running:

```
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

For complete details on using the Cobra-CLI generator, please read [The Cobra Generator README](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/blob/main/README.md)

For complete details on using the Cobra library, please read [The Cobra User Guide](site/content/user_guide.md).

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

Gin is a web framework written in [Go](https://go.dev/). It features a martini-like API with performance that is up to 40 times faster thanks to [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).
If you need performance and good productivity, you will love Gin.

**Gin&#039;s key features are:**

- Zero allocation router
- Speed
- Middleware support
- Crash-free
- JSON validation
- Route grouping
- Error management
- Built-in rendering
- Extensible

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Gin requires [Go](https://go.dev/) version [1.23](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.23.0) or above.

### Getting Gin

With [Go&#039;s module support](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules), `go [build|run|test]` automatically fetches the necessary dependencies when you add the import in your code:

```sh
import &quot;github.com/gin-gonic/gin&quot;
```

Alternatively, use `go get`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

### Running Gin

A basic example:

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/gin-gonic/gin&quot;
)

func main() {
  r := gin.Default()
  r.GET(&quot;/ping&quot;, func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;pong&quot;,
    })
  })
  r.Run() // listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080 (for windows &quot;localhost:8080&quot;)
}
```

To run the code, use the `go run` command, like:

```sh
go run example.go
```

Then visit [`0.0.0.0:8080/ping`](http://0.0.0.0:8080/ping) in your browser to see the response!

The Cosmos SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications. [CometBFT (BFT Consensus)](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) and the Cosmos SDK are written in the Go programming language. Cosmos SDK is used to build [Gaia](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), the implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

**WARNING**: The Cosmos SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some breaking changes.

**Note**: We advise to always use the latest maintained [Go](https://go.dev/dl) version for building Cosmos SDK applications.

## Quick Start

To learn how the Cosmos SDK works from a high-level perspective, see the Cosmos SDK [High-Level Intro](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/intro/overview.html).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of Cosmos SDK, visit [Cosmos SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network). You can also fork the tutorial&#039;s repository to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

For more information, see the [Cosmos SDK Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network).

## Modules

The Cosmos SDK maintains a set of modules that can be included in your blockchain application.  For more information
on modules, see our [introduction doc](./x/README.md).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute and participate in our [dev calls](./CONTRIBUTING.md#teams-dev-calls).
If you want to follow the updates or learn more about the latest design then join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cosmosnetwork).

## Tools and Frameworks

The Cosmos ecosystem is vast.
[Awesome Cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/awesome-cosmos) is a community-curated list of notable frameworks, modules and tools.

### Cosmos Hub Mainnet

The Cosmos Hub application, `gaia`, has its own [cosmos/gaia repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia). Go there to join the Cosmos Hub mainnet and more.

### Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC module for the Cosmos SDK has its own [cosmos/ibc-go repository](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go). Go there to build and integrate with the IBC module.

## Disambiguation

This Cosmos SDK project is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. As per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.

Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of
configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts),
and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

Flux version 2 (&quot;v2&quot;) is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes&#039;
API extension system, and to integrate with Prometheus and other core
components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. In version 2, Flux supports
multi-tenancy and support for syncing an arbitrary number of Git
repositories, among other long-requested features.

Flux v2 is constructed with the [GitOps Toolkit](#gitops-toolkit), a
set of composable APIs and specialized tools for building Continuous
Delivery on top of Kubernetes.

Flux is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/)) graduated project, used in
production by various [organisations](https://fluxcd.io/adopters) and [cloud providers](https://fluxcd.io/ecosystem).

## Quickstart and documentation

To get started check out this [guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/get-started/)
on how to bootstrap Flux on Kubernetes and deploy a sample application in a GitOps manner.

For more comprehensive documentation, see the following guides:
- [Ways of structuring your repositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/repository-structure/)
- [Manage Helm Releases](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/helmreleases/)
- [Automate image updates to Git](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/image-update/)  
- [Manage Kubernetes secrets with Flux and SOPS](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/)  

If you need help, please refer to our **[Support page](https://fluxcd.io/support/)**.

## GitOps Toolkit

The GitOps Toolkit is the set of APIs and controllers that make up the
runtime for Flux v2. The APIs comprise Kubernetes custom resources,
which can be created and updated by a cluster user, or by other
automation tooling.

![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxcd/flux2/main/docs/diagrams/fluxcd-controllers.png)

You can use the toolkit to extend Flux, or to build your own systems
for continuous delivery -- see [the developer
guides](https://fluxcd.io/flux/gitops-toolkit/source-watcher/).

## Install

The simplest, cross-platform way to get started is to download Caddy from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases) and place the executable file in your PATH.

See [our online documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) for other install instructions.

## Build from source

Requirements:

- [Go 1.24.0 or newer](https://golang.org/dl/)

### For development

_**Note:** These steps [will not embed proper version information](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29228). For that, please follow the instructions in the next section._

```bash
$ git clone &quot;https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy.git&quot;
$ cd caddy/cmd/caddy/
$ go build
```

When you run Caddy, it may try to bind to low ports unless otherwise specified in your config. If your OS requires elevated privileges for this, you will need to give your new binary permission to do so. On Linux, this can be done easily with: `sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./caddy`

If you prefer to use `go run` which only creates temporary binaries, you can still do this with the included `setcap.sh` like so:

```bash
$ go run -exec ./setcap.sh main.go
```

If you don&#039;t want to type your password for `setcap`, use `sudo visudo` to edit your sudoers file and allow your user account to run that command without a password, for example:

```
username ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/setcap
```

replacing `username` with your actual username. Please be careful and only do this if you know what you are doing! We are only qualified to document how to use Caddy, not Go tooling or your computer, and we are providing these instructions for convenience only; please learn how to use your own computer at your own risk and make any needful adjustments.

### With version information and/or plugins

Using [our builder tool, `xcaddy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy)...

```
$ xcaddy build
```

...the following steps are automated:

1. Create a new folder: `mkdir caddy`
2. Change into it: `cd caddy`
3. Copy [Caddy&#039;s main.go](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/blob/master/cmd/caddy/main.go) into the empty folder. Add imports for any custom plugins you want to add.
4. Initialize a Go module: `go mod init caddy`
5. (Optional) Pin Caddy version: `go get github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2@version` replacing `version` with a git tag, commit, or branch name.
6. (Optional) Add plugins by adding their import: `_ &quot;import/path/here&quot;`
7. Compile: `go build -tags=nobadger,nomysql,nopgx`




## Quick start

The [Caddy website](https://caddyserver.com/docs/) has documentation that includes tutorials, quick-start guides, reference, and more.

**We recommend that all users -- regardless of experience level -- do our [Getting Started](https://caddyserver.com/docs/getting-started) guide to become familiar with using Caddy.**

If you&#039;ve only got a minute, [the website has several quick-start tutorials](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts) to choose from! However, after finishing a quick-start tutorial, please read more documentation to understand how the software works. 🙂




## Overview

Caddy is most often used as an HTTPS server, but it is suitable for any long-running Go program. First and foremost, it is a platform to run Go applications. Caddy &quot;apps&quot; are just Go programs that are implemented as Caddy modules. Two apps -- `tls` and `http` -- ship standard with Caddy.

Caddy apps instantly benefit from [automated documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/), graceful on-line [config changes via API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/api), and unification with other Caddy apps.

Although [JSON](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/) is Caddy&#039;s native config language, Caddy can accept input from [config adapters](https://caddyserver.com/docs/config-adapters) which can essentially convert any config format of your choice into JSON: Caddyfile, JSON 5, YAML, TOML, NGINX config, and more.

The primary way to configure Caddy is through [its API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/api), but if you prefer config files, the [command-line interface](https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line) supports those too.

Caddy exposes an unprecedented level of control compared to any web server in existence. In Caddy, you are usually setting the actual values of the initialized types in memory that power everything from your HTTP handlers and TLS handshakes to your storage medium. Caddy is also ridiculously extensible, with a powerful plugin system that makes vast improvements over other web servers.

To wield the power of this design, you need to know how the config document is structured. Please see [our documentation site](https://caddyserver.com/docs/) for details about [Caddy&#039;s config structure](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/).

Nearly all of Caddy&#039;s configuration is contained in a single config document, rather than being scattered across CLI flags and env variables and a configuration file as with other web servers. This makes managing your server config more straightforward and reduces hidden variables/factors.

- Individuals can exchange help for free on our community forum at https://caddy.community. Remember that people give help out of their spare time and good will. The best way to get help is to give it first!

Please use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues) only for bug reports and feature requests, i.e. actionable development items (support questions will usually be referred to the forums).



## About

Matthew Holt began developing Caddy in 2014 while studying computer science at Brigham Young University. (The name &quot;Caddy&quot; was chosen because this software helps with the tedious, mundane tasks of serving the Web, and is also a single place for multiple things to be organized together.) It soon became the first web server to use HTTPS automatically and by default, and now has hundreds of contributors and has served trillions of HTTPS requests.

**The name &quot;Caddy&quot; is trademarked.** The name of the software is &quot;Caddy&quot;, not &quot;Caddy Server&quot; or &quot;CaddyServer&quot;. Please call it &quot;Caddy&quot; or, if you wish to clarify, &quot;the Caddy web server&quot;. Caddy is a registered trademark of Stack Holdings GmbH.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>![go-git logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/src-d/artwork/02036484/go-git/files/go-git-github-readme-header.png)
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5?status.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5) [![Build Status](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/actions) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/go-git/go-git)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/go-git/go-git)

*go-git* is a highly extensible git implementation library written in **pure Go**.

It can be used to manipulate git repositories at low level *(plumbing)* or high level *(porcelain)*, through an idiomatic Go API. It also supports several types of storage, such as in-memory filesystems, or custom implementations, thanks to the [`Storer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/storer) interface.

It&#039;s being actively developed since 2015 and is being used extensively by [Keybase](https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone), [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) or [Pulumi](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apulumi+go-git&amp;type=Code), and by many other libraries and tools.

Project Status
--------------

After the [legal issues](https://github.com/src-d/go-git/issues/1295#issuecomment-592965250) with the [`src-d`](https://github.com/src-d) organization, the lack of update for four months and the requirement to make a hard fork, the project is **now back to normality**.

The project is currently actively maintained by individual contributors, including several of the original authors, but also backed by a new company, [gitsight](https://github.com/gitsight), where `go-git` is a critical component used at scale.


Comparison with git
-------------------

*go-git* aims to be fully compatible with [git](https://github.com/git/git), all the *porcelain* operations are implemented to work exactly as *git* does.

*git* is a humongous project with years of development by thousands of contributors, making it challenging for *go-git* to implement all the features. You can find a comparison of *go-git* vs *git* in the [compatibility documentation](COMPATIBILITY.md).


Installation
------------

The recommended way to install *go-git* is:

```go
import &quot;github.com/go-git/go-git/v5&quot; // with go modules enabled (GO111MODULE=on or outside GOPATH)
import &quot;github.com/go-git/go-git&quot; // with go modules disabled
```


Examples
--------

&gt; Please note that the `CheckIfError` and `Info` functions  used in the examples are from the [examples package](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/blob/master/_examples/common.go#L19) just to be used in the examples.


### Basic example

A basic example that mimics the standard `git clone` command

```go
// Clone the given repository to the given directory
Info(&quot;git clone https://github.com/go-git/go-git&quot;)

_, err := git.PlainClone(&quot;/tmp/foo&quot;, false, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
    URL:      &quot;https://github.com/go-git/go-git&quot;,
    Progress: os.Stdout,
})

CheckIfError(err)
```

Outputs:
```

### In-memory example

Cloning a repository into memory and printing the history of HEAD, just like `git log` does


```go
// Clones the given repository in memory, creating the remote, the local
// branches and fetching the objects, exactly as:
Info(&quot;git clone https://github.com/go-git/go-billy&quot;)

r, err := git.Clone(memory.NewStorage(), nil, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
    URL: &quot;https://github.com/go-git/go-billy&quot;,
})

CheckIfError(err)

// Gets the HEAD history from HEAD, just like this command:
Info(&quot;git log&quot;)

// ... retrieves the branch pointed by HEAD
ref, err := r.Head()
CheckIfError(err)


// ... retrieves the commit history
cIter, err := r.Log(&amp;git.LogOptions{From: ref.Hash()})
CheckIfError(err)

// ... just iterates over the commits, printing it
err = cIter.ForEach(func(c *object.Commit) error {
	fmt.Println(c)
	return nil
})
CheckIfError(err)
```

Outputs:
```

## This library has **NO** relation to the go-yaml/yaml library

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This library is developed from scratch to replace [`go-yaml/yaml`](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml).
&gt; If you&#039;re looking for a better YAML library, this one should be helpful.

# Why a new library?

As of this writing, there already exists a de facto standard library for YAML processing for Go: [https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml). However, we believe that a new YAML library is necessary for the following reasons:

- Not actively maintained
- `go-yaml/yaml` has ported the libyaml written in C to Go, so the source code is not written in Go style
- There is a lot of content that cannot be parsed
- YAML is often used for configuration, and it is common to include validation along with it. However, the errors in `go-yaml/yaml` are not intuitive, and it is difficult to provide meaningful validation errors
- When creating tools that use YAML, there are cases where reversible transformation of YAML is required. However, to perform reversible transformations of content that includes Comments or Anchors/Aliases, manipulating the AST is the only option
- Non-intuitive [Marshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v3#Marshaler) / [Unmarshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v3#Unmarshaler)

By the way, libraries such as [ghodss/yaml](https://github.com/ghodss/yaml) and [sigs.k8s.io/yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/yaml) also depend on go-yaml/yaml, so if you are using these libraries, the same issues apply: they cannot parse things that go-yaml/yaml cannot parse, and they inherit many of the problems that go-yaml/yaml has.

# Features

- No dependencies
- A better parser than `go-yaml/yaml`. 
  - [Support recursive processing](https://github.com/apple/device-management/blob/release/docs/schema.yaml)
  - Higher coverage in the [YAML Test Suite](https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite?tab=readme-ov-file)
    - YAML Test Suite consists of 402 cases in total, of which `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` passes `295`. In addition to passing all those test cases, `goccy/go-yaml` successfully passes nearly 60 additional test cases ( 2024/12/15 )
    - The test code is [here](https://github.com/goccy/go-yaml/blob/master/yaml_test_suite_test.go#L77)
- Ease and sustainability of maintenance
  - The main maintainer is [@goccy](https://github.com/goccy), but we are also building a system to develop as a team with trusted developers
  - Since it is written from scratch, the code is easy to read for Gophers
- An API structure that allows the use of not only `Encoder`/`Decoder` but also `Tokenizer` and `Parser` functionalities.
  - [lexer.Tokenize](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goccy/go-yaml@v1.15.4/lexer#Tokenize)
  - [parser.Parse](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goccy/go-yaml@v1.15.4/parser#Parse)
- Filtering, replacing, and merging YAML content using YAML Path
- Reversible transformation without using the AST for YAML that includes Anchors, Aliases, and Comments
- Customize the Marshal/Unmarshal behavior for primitive types and third-party library types ([RegisterCustomMarshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goccy/go-yaml#RegisterCustomMarshaler), [RegisterCustomUnmarshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goccy/go-yaml#RegisterCustomUnmarshaler))
- Respects `encoding/json` behavior
  - Accept the `json` tag. Note that not all options from the `json` tag will have significance when parsing YAML documents. If both tags exist, `yaml` tag will take precedence.
  - [json.Marshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshaler) style [marshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goccy/go-yaml#BytesMarshaler)
  - [json.Unmarshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Unmarshaler) style [unmarshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goccy/go-yaml#BytesUnmarshaler)
  - Options for using `MarshalJSON` and `UnmarshalJSON` ([UseJSONMarshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goccy/go-yaml#UseJSONMarshaler), [UseJSONUnmarshaler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goccy/go-yaml#UseJSONUnmarshaler))
- Pretty format for error notifications
- Smart validation processing combined with [go-playground/validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator)
  - [example test code is here](https://github.com/goccy/go-yaml/blob/45889c98b0a0967240eb595a1bd6896e2f575106/testdata/validate_test.go#L12)
- Allow referencing elements declared in another file via anchors

# Installation

```sh
go get github.com/goccy/go-yaml
```

# Synopsis

## 1. Simple Encode/Decode

Has an interface like `go-yaml/yaml` using `reflect`

```go
var v struct {
	A int
	B string
}
v.A = 1
v.B = &quot;hello&quot;
bytes, err := yaml.Marshal(v)
if err != nil {
	//...
}
fmt.Println(string(bytes)) // &quot;a: 1\nb: hello\n&quot;
```

```go
	yml := `
%YAML 1.2
---
a: 1
b: c
`
var v struct {
	A int
	B string
}
if err := yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(yml), &amp;v); err != nil {
	//...
}
```

To control marshal/unmarshal behavior, you can use the `yaml` tag.

```go
	yml := `---
foo: 1
bar: c
`
var v struct {
	A int    `yaml:&quot;foo&quot;`
	B string `yaml:&quot;bar&quot;`
}
if err := yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(yml), &amp;v); err != nil {
	//...
}
```

For convenience, we also accept the `json` tag. Note that not all options from
the `json` tag will have significance when parsing YAML documents. If both
tags exist, `yaml` tag will take precedence.

```go
	yml := `---
foo: 1
bar: c
`
var v struct {
	A int    `json:&quot;foo&quot;`
	B string `json:&quot;bar&quot;`
}
if err := yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(yml), &amp;v); err != nil {
	//...
}
```

For custom marshal/unmarshaling, implement either `Bytes` or `Interface` variant of marshaler/unmarshaler. The difference is that while `BytesMarshaler`/`BytesUnmarshaler` behaves like [`encoding/json`](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json) and `InterfaceMarshaler`/`InterfaceUnmarshaler` behaves like [`gopkg.in/yaml.v2`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v2).

Semantically both are the same, but they differ in performance. Because indentation matters in YAML, you cannot simply accept a valid YAML fragment from a Marshaler, and expect it to work when it is attached to the parent container&#039;s serialized form. Therefore when we receive use the `BytesMarshaler`, which returns `[]byte`, we must decode it once to figure out how to make it work in the given context. If you use the `InterfaceMarshaler`, we can skip the decoding.

If you are repeatedly marshaling complex objects, the latter is always better
performance wise. But if you are, for example, just providing a choice between
a config file format that is read only once, the former is probably easier to
code.

## 2. Reference elements declared in another file

`testdata` directory contains `anchor.yml` file:

```shell
├── testdata
   └── anchor.yml
```

And `anchor.yml` is defined as follows:

```yaml
a: &amp;a
  b: 1
  c: hello
```

Then, if `yaml.ReferenceDirs(&quot;testdata&quot;)` option is passed to `yaml.Decoder`, 
 `Decoder` tries to find the anchor definition from YAML files the under `testdata` directory.
 
```go
buf := bytes.NewBufferString(&quot;a: *a\n&quot;)
dec := yaml.NewDecoder(buf, yaml.ReferenceDirs(&quot;testdata&quot;))
var v struct {
	A struct {
		B int
		C string
	}
}
if err := dec.Decode(&amp;v); err != nil {
	//...
}
fmt.Printf(&quot;%+v\n&quot;, v) // {A:{B:1 C:hello}}
```

## 3. Encode with `Anchor` and `Alias`

### 3.1. Explicitly declared `Anchor` name and `Alias` name

If you want to use `anchor`, you can define it as a struct tag.
If the value specified for an anchor is a pointer type and the same address as the pointer is found, the value is automatically set to alias.
If an explicit alias name is specified, an error is raised if its value is different from the value specified in the anchor.

```go
type T struct {
  A int
  B string
}
var v struct {
  C *T `yaml:&quot;c,anchor=x&quot;`
  D *T `yaml:&quot;d,alias=x&quot;`
}
v.C = &amp;T{A: 1, B: &quot;hello&quot;}
v.D = v.C
bytes, err := yaml.Marshal(v)
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
fmt.Println(string(bytes))
/*
c: &amp;x
  a: 1
  b: hello
d: *x
*/
```

### 3.2. Implicitly declared `Anchor` and `Alias` names

If you do not explicitly declare the anchor name, the default behavior is to
use the equivalent of `strings.ToLower($FieldName)` as the name of the anchor.
If the value specified for an anchor is a pointer type and the same address as the pointer is found, the value is automatically set to alias.

```go
type T struct {
	I int
	S string
}
var v struct {
	A *T `yaml:&quot;a,anchor&quot;`
	B *T `yaml:&quot;b,anchor&quot;`
	C *T `yaml:&quot;c&quot;`
	D *T `yaml:&quot;d&quot;`
}
v.A = &amp;T{I: 1, S: &quot;hello&quot;}
v.B = &amp;T{I: 2, S: &quot;world&quot;}
v.C = v.A // C has same pointer address to A
v.D = v.B // D has same pointer address to B
bytes, err := yaml.Marshal(v)
if err != nil {
	//...
}
fmt.Println(string(bytes)) 
/*
a: &amp;a
  i: 1
  s: hello
b: &amp;b
  i: 2
  s: world
c: *a
d: *b
*/
```

### 3.3 MergeKey and Alias

Merge key and alias ( `&lt;&lt;: *alias` ) can be used by embedding a structure with the `inline,alias` tag.

```go
type Person struct {
	*Person `yaml:&quot;,omitempty,inline,alias&quot;` // embed Person type for default value
	Name    string `yaml:&quot;,omitempty&quot;`
	Age     int    `yaml:&quot;,omitempty&quot;`
}
defaultPerson := &amp;Person{
	Name: &quot;John Smith&quot;,
	Age:  20,
}
people := []*Person{
	{
		Person: defaultPerson, // assign default value
		Name:   &quot;Ken&quot;,         // override Name property
		Age:    10,            // override Age property
	},
	{
		Person: defaultPerson, // assign default value only
	},
}
var doc struct {
	Default *Person   `yaml:&quot;default,anchor&quot;`
	People  []*Person `yaml:&quot;people&quot;`
}
doc.Default = defaultPerson
doc.People = people
bytes, err := yaml.Marshal(doc)
if err != nil {
	//...
}
fmt.Println(string(bytes))
/*
default: &amp;default
  name: John Smith
  age: 20
people:
- &lt;&lt;: *default
  name: Ken
  age: 10
- &lt;&lt;: *default
*/
```

## 4. Pretty Formatted Errors

Error values produced during parsing have two extra features over regular
error values.

First, by default, they contain extra information on the location of the error
from the source YAML document, to make it easier to find the error location.

Second, the error messages can optionally be colorized.

If you would like to control exactly how the output looks like, consider
using  `yaml.FormatError`, which accepts two boolean values to
control turning these features on or off.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/209884/67358124-587f0980-f59a-11e9-96fc-7205aab77695.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;

## 5. Use YAMLPath

```go
yml := `
store:
  book:
    - author: john
      price: 10
    - author: ken
      price: 12
  bicycle:
    color: red
    price: 19.95
`
path, err := yaml.PathString(&quot;$.store.book[*].author&quot;)
if err != nil {
  //...
}
var authors []string
if err := path.Read(strings.NewReader(yml), &amp;authors); err != nil {
  //...
}
fmt.Println(authors)
// [john ken]
```

### 5.1 Print customized error with YAML source code

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;fmt&quot;

  &quot;github.com/goccy/go-yaml&quot;
)

func main() {
  yml := `
a: 1
b: &quot;hello&quot;
`
  var v struct {
    A int
    B string
  }
  if err := yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(yml), &amp;v); err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  if v.A != 2 {
    // output error with YAML source
    path, err := yaml.PathString(&quot;$.a&quot;)
    if err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }
    source, err := path.AnnotateSource([]byte(yml), true)
    if err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf(&quot;a value expected 2 but actual %d:\n%s\n&quot;, v.A, string(source))
  }
}
```

output result is the following:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/209884/84148813-7aca8680-aa9a-11ea-8fc9-37dece2ebdac.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;

The present repository contains the source code of the Datadog Agent version 7 and version 6. Please refer to the [Agent user documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) for information about differences between Agent v5, Agent v6 and Agent v7. Additionally, we provide a list of prepackaged binaries for an easy install process [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings/agent/latest?platform=overview)

**Note:** the source code of Datadog Agent v5 is located in the
[dd-agent](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent) repository.

## Documentation

The general documentation of the project, including instructions for installation
and development, is located under [the docs directory](docs) of the present repo.

## Getting started

To build the Agent you need:
 * [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.23 or later. You&#039;ll also need to set your `$GOPATH` and have `$GOPATH/bin` in your path.
 * Python 3.11+ along with development libraries for tooling. You will also need Python 2.7 if you are building the Agent with Python 2 support.
 * Python dependencies. You may install these with `pip install dda`.
 * CMake version 3.15 or later and a C++ compiler

**Note:** you may want to use a python virtual environment to avoid polluting your
      system-wide python environment with the agent build/dev dependencies. You can
      create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` and then use the `dda inv agent.build`
      parameters `--python-home-3=&lt;venv_path&gt;` to use the virtual environment&#039;s
      interpreter and libraries. By default, this environment is only used for dev dependencies.

**Note:** You may have previously installed `invoke` via brew on MacOS, or `pip` in
      any other platform. We recommend you use the version pinned in the requirements
      file for a smooth development/build experience.

**Note:** You can enable auto completion for invoke tasks. Use the command below to add the appropriate line to your `.zshrc` file.
      `echo &quot;source &lt;(dda inv --print-completion-script zsh)&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc`

Builds and tests are orchestrated with `invoke`, type `dda inv --list` on a shell
to see the available tasks.

To start working on the Agent, you can build the `main` branch:

1. Checkout the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
2. cd into the project folder: `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
3. Install go tools: `dda inv install-tools` (if you have a timeout error, you might need to prepend the `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,https://goproxy.io,direct` env var to the command).
4. Create a development `datadog.yaml` configuration file in `dev/dist/datadog.yaml`, containing a valid API key: `api_key: &lt;API_KEY&gt;`. You can either start with an empty one or use the full one generated by the Agent build from Step 5 (located in `cmd/agent/dist/datadog.yaml` after the build finishes).
5. Build the agent with `dda inv agent.build --build-exclude=systemd`.

     You can specify a custom Python location for the agent (useful when using
     virtualenvs):

       dda inv agent.build \
         --python-home-3=$GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/venv3

    Running `dda inv agent.build`:

     * Discards any changes done in `bin/agent/dist`.
     * Builds the Agent and writes the binary to `bin/agent/agent`.
     * Copies files from `dev/dist` to `bin/agent/dist`. See `https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/dev/dist/README.md` for more information.

     If you built an older version of the agent, you may have the error `make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.`. To solve the issue, you should remove `CMakeCache.txt` from `rtloader` folder with `rm rtloader/CMakeCache.txt`.

     Please note that the [trace agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/) needs to be built and run separately.



Please refer to the [Agent Developer Guide](docs/dev/README.md) for more details. For instructions
on setting up a windows dev environment, refer to [Windows Dev Env](devenv).

## Testing

Run unit tests using `dda inv test`.
```
dda inv test --targets=./pkg/aggregator
```

You can also use `dda inv linter.go` to run just the go linters.
```
dda inv linter.go
```

When testing code that depends on [rtloader](/rtloader), build and install it first.
```
dda inv rtloader.make &amp;&amp; dda inv rtloader.install
dda inv test --targets=./pkg/collector/python
```

## Run

You can run the agent with:
```
./bin/agent/agent run -c bin/agent/dist/datadog.yaml
```

The file `bin/agent/dist/datadog.yaml` is copied from `dev/dist/datadog.yaml` by `dda inv agent.build` and must contain a valid api key.

### Run a JMX check
In order to run a JMX based check locally, you must have:
1. A copy of a JMXFetch `jar` copied to `dev/dist/jmx/jmxfetch.jar`
2. `java` available on your `$PATH`

For detailed instructions, see [JMX checks](./docs/dev/checks/jmxfetch.md)

## Contributing code

You&#039;ll find information and help on how to contribute code to this project under
[the `docs/dev` directory](docs/dev) of the present repo.

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to
receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need
to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support
open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to
multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

Objectives:

- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.
- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.
- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.
- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.
- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.

## Community

The OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)
channel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via
video calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:

- meet the humans behind the project
- get an opinion about specific proposals
- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack
- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously

We rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to
allow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:

Tuesday:

- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)

Wednesday:

- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)
- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)

Contributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.
Post a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong
reasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to
identify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.

Remember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the
relevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull
request where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous
calls and don&#039;t want them to feel excluded.

## Supported OTLP version

This code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,
considered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability
definition
here.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)

## Stability levels

See [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.

## Compatibility

When used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.

Support for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:

1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.
2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.

Official OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.

## Verifying the images signatures

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.

We are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:

```console
$ cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt; \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  &lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;
```

where:

- `&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt;`: is the release that you want to validate
- `&lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;`: is the image that you want to check

Example:

```console
$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0

Verification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates

# Beats - The Lightweight Shippers of the Elastic Stack

The [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats) are lightweight data
shippers, written in Go, that you install on your servers to capture all sorts
of operational data (think of logs, metrics, or network packet data). The Beats
send the operational data to Elasticsearch, either directly or via Logstash, so
it can be visualized with Kibana.

By &quot;lightweight&quot;, we mean that Beats have a small installation footprint, use
limited system resources, and have no runtime dependencies.

This repository contains
[libbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/libbeat), our Go
framework for creating Beats, and all the officially supported Beats:

Beat  | Description
--- | ---
[Auditbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/auditbeat) | Collect your Linux audit framework data and monitor the integrity of your files.
[Filebeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/filebeat) | Tails and ships log files
[Heartbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/heartbeat) | Ping remote services for availability
[Metricbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/metricbeat) | Fetches sets of metrics from the operating system and services
[Packetbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/packetbeat) | Monitors the network and applications by sniffing packets
[Winlogbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/winlogbeat) | Fetches and ships Windows Event logs
[Osquerybeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/x-pack/osquerybeat) | Runs Osquery and manages interraction with it.

In addition to the above Beats, which are officially supported by
[Elastic](https://elastic.co), the community has created a set of other Beats
that make use of libbeat but live outside of this Github repository. We maintain
a list of community Beats
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/master/community-beats.html).

## About

Actions Runner Controller (ARC) is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates and scales self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions.

With ARC, you can create runner scale sets that automatically scale based on the number of workflows running in your repository, organization, or enterprise. Because controlled runners can be ephemeral and based on containers, new runner instances can scale up or down rapidly and cleanly. For more information about autoscaling, see [&quot;Autoscaling with self-hosted runners.&quot;](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners)

You can set up ARC on Kubernetes using Helm, then create and run a workflow that uses runner scale sets. For more information about runner scale sets, see [&quot;Deploying runner scale sets with Actions Runner Controller.&quot;](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/deploying-runner-scale-sets-with-actions-runner-controller#runner-scale-set)

## People

Actions Runner Controller (ARC) is an open-source project currently developed and maintained in collaboration with the GitHub Actions team, external maintainers @mumoshu and @toast-gear, various [contributors](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/graphs/contributors), and the [awesome community](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/discussions).

If you think the project is awesome and is adding value to your business, please consider directly sponsoring [community maintainers](https://github.com/sponsors/actions-runner-controller) and individual contributors via GitHub Sponsors.

If you are already the employer of one of the contributors, sponsoring via GitHub Sponsors might not be an option. Just support them by other means!

See [the sponsorship dashboard](https://github.com/sponsors/actions-runner-controller) for the former and the current sponsors.

## Getting Started

To give ARC a try with just a handful of commands, please refer to the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/quickstart-for-actions-runner-controller).

For an overview of ARC, please refer to [About ARC](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/about-actions-runner-controller).

With the introduction of [autoscaling runner scale sets](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/discussions/2775), the existing [autoscaling modes](./docs/automatically-scaling-runners.md) are now legacy. The legacy modes have certain use cases and will continue to be maintained by the community only.

For further information on what is supported by GitHub and what&#039;s managed by the community, please refer to [this announcement discussion.](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/discussions/2775)

### Documentation

ARC documentation is available on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/quickstart-for-actions-runner-controller).

**Authelia** is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single
sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. It acts as a companion for [reverse proxies](#proxy-support) by
allowing, denying, or redirecting requests.

Documentation is available at [https://www.authelia.com/](https://www.authelia.com/).

The following is a simple diagram of the architecture:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin:50px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.authelia.com/images/archi.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**Authelia** can be installed as a standalone service from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/authelia/),
[APT](https://apt.authelia.com/stable/debian/packages/authelia/),
[FreeBSD Ports](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/www/authelia/), or using a
[static binary](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest),
[.deb package](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest), as a container on [Docker] or [Kubernetes].


Deployment can be orchestrated via the Helm [Chart](https://charts.authelia.com) (beta) leveraging ingress controllers
and ingress configurations.

* Choice between one-factor and two-factor policies per-rule.
* Support of basic authentication for endpoints protected by the one-factor policy.
* Highly available using a remote database and Redis as a highly available KV store.
* Compatible with [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik) out of the box using the
  [ForwardAuth](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/forwardauth/) middleware.
* Curated configuration from [LinuxServer](https://www.linuxserver.io/) via their
  [SWAG](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag) container as well as a
  [guide](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2020/08/26/setting-up-authelia/).
* Compatible with [Caddy] using the [forward_auth](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/forward_auth)
  directive.
* Kubernetes Support:
  * Compatible with several Kubernetes ingress controllers:
    * [ingress-nginx](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/nginx-ingress/)
    * [Traefik Kubernetes CRD](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/traefik-ingress/#ingressroute)
    * [Traefik Kubernetes Ingress](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/traefik-ingress/#ingress)
    * [Istio](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/istio/)

&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting Started

See the [Get Started Guide](https://www.authelia.com/integration/prologue/get-started/) or one of the curated examples
below.

### docker compose

The `docker compose` bundles act as a starting point for anyone wanting to see Authelia in action. You will have to
customize them to your needs as they come with self-signed certificates.

#### [Local](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/#local)
The Local compose bundle is intended to test Authelia without worrying about configuration.
It&#039;s meant to be used for scenarios where the server is not be exposed to the internet.
Domains will be defined in the local hosts file and self-signed certificates will be utilised.

#### [Lite](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/#lite)
The Lite compose bundle is intended for scenarios where the server will be exposed to the internet, domains and DNS will
need to be setup accordingly and certificates will be generated through LetsEncrypt. The Lite element refers to minimal
external dependencies; File based user storage, SQLite based configuration storage. In this configuration, the service
will not scale well.

## Deployment

Now that you have tested **Authelia** and you want to try it out in your own infrastructure,
you can learn how to deploy and use it with [Deployment](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/introduction/).
This guide will show you how to deploy it on bare metal as well as on
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Security

Authelia takes security very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in Authelia, please see our
[Security Policy](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/security/policy).

For more information about [security](https://www.authelia.com/policies/security/) related matters, please read

## Breaking changes

Since Authelia is still under active development, it is subject to breaking changes. It&#039;s recommended to pin a version
tag instead of using the `latest` tag and reading the [release notes](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases)
before upgrading. This is where you will find information about breaking changes and what you should do to overcome
said changes.

## Why Open Source?

You might wonder why Authelia is open source while it adds a great deal of security and user experience to your
infrastructure at zero cost. It is open source because we firmly believe that security should be available for all to
benefit in the face of the battlefield which is the Internet, with near zero effort.

Additionally, keeping the code open source is a way to leave it auditable by anyone who is willing to contribute. This
way, you can be confident that the product remains secure and does not act maliciously.

It&#039;s important to keep in mind Authelia is not directly exposed on the
Internet (your reverse proxies are) however, it&#039;s still the control plane for your internal security so take care of it!

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

[![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci-runs] [![Go Reference][reference-badge]][reference]

gomock is a mocking framework for the [Go programming language][golang]. It
integrates well with Go&#039;s built-in `testing` package, but can be used in other
contexts too.

This project originates from Google&#039;s `golang/mock` repo. Unfortunately, Google
no longer maintains this project, and given the heavy usage of gomock project
within Uber, we&#039;ve decided to fork and maintain this going forward at Uber.

[Contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome in the form of GitHub issue or PR!

## Supported Go Versions

go.uber.org/mock supports all Go versions supported by the official
[Go Release Policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). That is,
the two most recent releases of Go.

## Installation

Install the `mockgen` tool.

```
go install go.uber.org/mock/mockgen@latest
```

To ensure it was installed correctly, use:

```
mockgen -version
```

If that fails, make sure your GOPATH/bin is in your PATH. You can add it with:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

## Running mockgen

`mockgen` has two modes of operation: source and package.

### Source mode

Source mode generates mock interfaces from a source file.
It is enabled by using the -source flag. Other flags that
may be useful in this mode are -imports and -aux_files.

Example:

```bash
mockgen -source=foo.go [other options]
```

### Package mode

Package mode works by specifying the package and interface names.
It is enabled by passing two non-flag arguments: an import path, and a
comma-separated list of symbols.

You can use &quot;.&quot; to refer to the current path&#039;s package.

Example:

```bash
mockgen database/sql/driver Conn,Driver

# Convenient for `go:generate`.
mockgen . Conn,Driver
```

### Flags

The `mockgen` command is used to generate source code for a mock
class given a Go source file containing interfaces to be mocked.
It supports the following flags:

- `-source`: A file containing interfaces to be mocked.

- `-destination`: A file to which to write the resulting source code. If you
  don&#039;t set this, the code is printed to standard output.

- `-package`: The package to use for the resulting mock class
  source code. If you don&#039;t set this, the package name is `mock_` concatenated
  with the package of the input file.

- `-imports`: A list of explicit imports that should be used in the resulting
  source code, specified as a comma-separated list of elements of the form
  `foo=bar/baz`, where `bar/baz` is the package being imported and `foo` is
  the identifier to use for the package in the generated source code.

- `-aux_files`: A list of additional files that should be consulted to
  resolve e.g. embedded interfaces defined in a different file. This is
  specified as a comma-separated list of elements of the form
  `foo=bar/baz.go`, where `bar/baz.go` is the source file and `foo` is the
  package name of that file used by the -source file.

- `-build_flags`: (package mode only) Flags passed verbatim to `go list`.

- `-mock_names`: A list of custom names for generated mocks. This is specified
  as a comma-separated list of elements of the form
  `Repository=MockSensorRepository,Endpoint=MockSensorEndpoint`, where
  `Repository` is the interface name and `MockSensorRepository` is the desired
  mock name (mock factory method and mock recorder will be named after the mock).
  If one of the interfaces has no custom name specified, then default naming
  convention will be used.

- `-self_package`: The full package import path for the generated code. The
  purpose of this flag is to prevent import cycles in the generated code by
  trying to include its own package. This can happen if the mock&#039;s package is
  set to one of its inputs (usually the main one) and the output is stdio so
  mockgen cannot detect the final output package. Setting this flag will then
  tell mockgen which import to exclude.

- `-copyright_file`: Copyright file used to add copyright header to the resulting source code.

- `-debug_parser`: Print out parser results only.

- `-write_package_comment`: Writes package documentation comment (godoc) if true. (default true)

- `-write_generate_directive`: Add //go:generate directive to regenerate the mock. (default false)

- `-write_source_comment`: Writes original file (source mode) or interface names (package mode) comment if true. (default true)

- `-typed`: Generate Type-safe &#039;Return&#039;, &#039;Do&#039;, &#039;DoAndReturn&#039; function. (default false)

- `-exclude_interfaces`: Comma-separated names of interfaces to be excluded

For an example of the use of `mockgen`, see the `sample/` directory. In simple
cases, you will need only the `-source` flag.

## Building Mocks

```go
type Foo interface {
  Bar(x int) int
}

func SUT(f Foo) {
 // ...
}

```

```go
func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
  ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)

  m := NewMockFoo(ctrl)

  // Asserts that the first and only call to Bar() is passed 99.
  // Anything else will fail.
  m.
    EXPECT().
    Bar(gomock.Eq(99)).
    Return(101)

  SUT(m)
}
```

## Building Stubs

```go
type Foo interface {
  Bar(x int) int
}

func SUT(f Foo) {
 // ...
}

```

```go
func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
  ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)

  m := NewMockFoo(ctrl)

  // Does not make any assertions. Executes the anonymous functions and returns
  // its result when Bar is invoked with 99.
  m.
    EXPECT().
    Bar(gomock.Eq(99)).
    DoAndReturn(func(_ int) int {
      time.Sleep(1*time.Second)
      return 101
    }).
    AnyTimes()

  // Does not make any assertions. Returns 103 when Bar is invoked with 101.
  m.
    EXPECT().
    Bar(gomock.Eq(101)).
    Return(103).
    AnyTimes()

  SUT(m)
}
```

## Modifying Failure Messages

When a matcher reports a failure, it prints the received (`Got`) vs the
expected (`Want`) value.

```shell
Got: [3]
Want: is equal to 2
Expected call at user_test.go:33 doesn&#039;t match the argument at index 1.
Got: [0 1 1 2 3]
Want: is equal to 1
```

### Modifying `Want`

The `Want` value comes from the matcher&#039;s `String()` method. If the matcher&#039;s
default output doesn&#039;t meet your needs, then it can be modified as follows:

```go
gomock.WantFormatter(
  gomock.StringerFunc(func() string { return &quot;is equal to fifteen&quot; }),
  gomock.Eq(15),
)
```

This modifies the `gomock.Eq(15)` matcher&#039;s output for `Want:` from `is equal
to 15` to `is equal to fifteen`.

### Modifying `Got`

The `Got` value comes from the object&#039;s `String()` method if it is available.
In some cases the output of an object is difficult to read (e.g., `[]byte`) and
it would be helpful for the test to print it differently. The following
modifies how the `Got` value is formatted:

```go
gomock.GotFormatterAdapter(
  gomock.GotFormatterFunc(func(i any) string {
    // Leading 0s
    return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%02d&quot;, i)
  }),
  gomock.Eq(15),
)
```

If the received value is `3`, then it will be printed as `03`.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.
