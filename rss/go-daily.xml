&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Vault Logo&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/f22d202cde2018f9455dec755118a9b84586e082/Vault_PrimaryLogo_Black.png&quot;&gt;

Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.

The key features of Vault are:

* **Secure Secret Storage**: Vault can store arbitrary key/value pairs. Vault encrypts data before writing it to persistent
  storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn&#039;t enough to access
  your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io),
  and more.

* **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some
  systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application
  needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault
  will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After
  creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them
  after the lease is up.

* **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing
  it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and
  developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without
  having to design their own encryption methods.

* **Leasing and Renewal**: Vault associates a **lease** with each secret.
  At the end of the lease, Vault automatically revokes the
  secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.

* **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault
  can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example,
  all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.
  Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the
  case of an intrusion.

Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams
-------------------------------

Documentation is available on the [Vault website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs).

If you&#039;re new to Vault and want to get started with security automation, please
check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/getting-started)
on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault)
to continue your learning.

For examples of how to interact with Vault from inside your application in different programming languages, see the [vault-examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-examples) repo. An out-of-the-box [sample application](https://github.com/hashicorp/hello-vault-go) is also available.

Show off your Vault knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the
[certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/#hashicorp-certified-vault-associate)
for information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/certification)
on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform.

Developing Vault
--------------------

If you wish to work on Vault itself or any of its built-in systems, you&#039;ll
first need [Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.

For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a
[GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), then setting the 
[GOBIN](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables) variable to `$GOPATH/bin`. 
Ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your path as some distributions bundle the old version 
of build tools. 

Next, clone this repository. Vault uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules),
so it is recommended that you clone the repository ***outside*** of the GOPATH.
You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:

```sh
$ make bootstrap
...
```

To compile a development version of Vault, run `make` or `make dev`. This will
put the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make dev
...
$ bin/vault
...
```

To compile a development version of Vault with the UI, run `make static-dist dev-ui`. This will
put the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/vault
...
```

To run tests, type `make test`. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If
this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!

```sh
$ make test
...
```

If you&#039;re developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that
package by specifying the `TEST` variable. For example below, only
`vault` package tests will be run.

```sh
$ make test TEST=./vault
...
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like `could not read Username for &#039;https://github.com&#039;` you may need to adjust your git config like so:

```sh
$ git config --global --add url.&quot;git@github.com:&quot;.insteadOf &quot;https://github.com/&quot;
```


### Importing Vault

This repository publishes two libraries that may be imported by other projects:
`github.com/hashicorp/vault/api` and `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk`.

Note that this repository also contains Vault (the product), and as with most Go
projects, Vault uses Go modules to manage its dependencies. The mechanism to do
that is the [go.mod](./go.mod) file. As it happens, the presence of that file
also makes it theoretically possible to import Vault as a dependency into other
projects. Some other projects have made a practice of doing so in order to take
advantage of testing tooling that was developed for testing Vault itself. This
is not, and has never been, a supported way to use the Vault project. We aren&#039;t 
likely to fix bugs relating to failure to import `github.com/hashicorp/vault` 
into your project.

See also the section &quot;Docker-based tests&quot; below.

### Acceptance Tests

Vault has comprehensive [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)
covering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.

If you&#039;re working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to
verify it is functioning (and also hasn&#039;t broken anything else), we recommend
running the acceptance tests.

**Warning:** The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify *real resources*, which
may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically
possible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,
please run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least,
we recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend
you&#039;re testing.

To run the acceptance tests, invoke `make testacc`:

```sh
$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul
...
```

The `TEST` variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the
backend is. The `TESTARGS` variable is recommended to filter down to a specific
resource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very
long time.

Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for
things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell
you what to set, so it is not documented here.

For more information on Vault Enterprise features, visit the [Vault Enterprise site](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=github-vault-enterprise).

### Docker-based Tests

We have created an experimental new testing mechanism inspired by NewTestCluster.
An example of how to use it:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;hashicorp/vault&quot;, // or &quot;hashicorp/vault-enterprise&quot;
    ImageTag:    &quot;latest&quot;,
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
  
  client := cluster.Nodes()[0].APIClient()
  _, err := client.Logical().Read(&quot;sys/storage/raft/configuration&quot;)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Or for Enterprise:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;hashicorp/vault-enterprise&quot;,
    ImageTag:  &quot;latest&quot;,
	VaultLicense: licenseString, // not a path, the actual license bytes
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

Here is a more realistic example of how we use it in practice.  DefaultOptions uses 
`hashicorp/vault`:`latest` as the repo and tag, but it also looks at the environment
variable VAULT_BINARY. If populated, it will copy the local file referenced by
VAULT_BINARY into the container. This is useful when testing local changes.

Instead of setting the VaultLicense option, you can set the VAULT_LICENSE_CI environment
variable, which is better than committing a license to version control.

Optionally you can set COMMIT_SHA, which will be appended to the image name we
build as a debugging convenience.

```go
func Test_Custom_Build_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

There are a variety of helpers in the `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster`
package, e.g. these tests below will create a pair of 3-node clusters and link them using
PR or DR replication respectively, and fail if the replication state doesn&#039;t become healthy
before the passed context expires.

Again, as written, these depend on having a Vault Enterprise binary locally and the env
var VAULT_BINARY set to point to it, as well as having VAULT_LICENSE_CI set.

```go
func TestStandardPerfReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)
  if err != nil {
      t.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer r.Cleanup()

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
  defer cancel()
  err = r.StandardPerfReplication(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func TestStandardDRReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer r.Cleanup()

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
  defer cancel()
  err = r.StandardDRReplication(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Finally, here&#039;s an example of running an existing OSS docker test with a custom binary:

```bash
$ GOOS=linux make dev
$ VAULT_BINARY=$(pwd)/bin/vault go test -run &#039;TestRaft_Configuration_Docker&#039; ./vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary
ok      github.com/hashicorp/vault/vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary        20.960s
```

# MinIO Quickstart Guide

[![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/minio/minio.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20V3-blue)](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE)

[![MinIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/.github/logo.svg?sanitize=true)](https://min.io)

MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage solution released under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license.
Designed for speed and scalability, it powers AI/ML, analytics, and data-intensive workloads with industry-leading performance.

- S3 API Compatible – Seamless integration with existing S3 tools
- Built for AI &amp; Analytics – Optimized for large-scale data pipelines
- High Performance – Ideal for demanding storage workloads.

This README provides instructions for building MinIO from source and deploying onto baremetal hardware.
Use the [MinIO Documentation](https://github.com/minio/docs) project to build and host a local copy of the documentation.

## MinIO is Open Source Software

We designed MinIO as Open Source software for the Open Source software community. We encourage the community to remix, redesign, and reshare MinIO under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

All usage of MinIO in your application stack requires validation against AGPLv3 obligations, which include but are not limited to the release of modified code to the community from which you have benefited. Any commercial/proprietary usage of the AGPLv3 software, including repackaging or reselling services/features, is done at your own risk.

The AGPLv3 provides no obligation by any party to support, maintain, or warranty the original or any modified work.
All support is provided on a best-effort basis through Github and our [Slack](https//slack.min.io) channel, and any member of the community is welcome to contribute and assist others in their usage of the software.

MinIO [AIStor](https://www.min.io/product/aistor) includes enterprise-grade support and licensing for workloads which require commercial or proprietary usage and production-level SLA/SLO-backed support. For more information, [reach out for a quote](https://min.io/pricing).

## Source-Only Distribution

**Important:** The MinIO community edition is now distributed as source code only. We will no longer provide pre-compiled binary releases for the community version.

### Installing Latest MinIO Community Edition

To use MinIO community edition, you have two options:

1. **Install from source** using `go install github.com/minio/minio@latest` (recommended)
2. **Build a Docker image** from the provided Dockerfile

See the sections below for detailed instructions on each method.

### Legacy Binary Releases

Historical pre-compiled binary releases remain available for reference but are no longer maintained:
- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/minio/minio/releases
- Direct downloads: https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/

**These legacy binaries will not receive updates.** We strongly recommend using source builds for access to the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates.

## Install from Source

Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source.
If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow [How to install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install). Minimum version required is [go1.24](https://golang.org/dl/#stable)

```sh
go install github.com/minio/minio@latest
```

You can alternatively run `go build` and use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to control the OS and architecture target.
For example:

```
env GOOS=linux GOARCh=arm64 go build
```

Start MinIO by running `minio server PATH` where `PATH` is any empty folder on your local filesystem.

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`.
You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.
Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials.
You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool:

```sh
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc admin info local
```

See [Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool.
For application developers, see &lt;https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/developers/sdk/&gt; to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Production environments using compiled-from-source MinIO binaries do so at their own risk.

## Build Docker Image

You can use the `docker build .` command to build a Docker image on your local host machine.
You must first [build MinIO](#install-from-source) and ensure the `minio` binary exists in the project root.

The following command builds the Docker image using the default `Dockerfile` in the root project directory with the repository and image tag `myminio:minio`

```sh
docker build -t myminio:minio .
```

Use `docker image ls` to confirm the image exists in your local repository.
You can run the server using standard Docker invocation:

```sh
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 myminio:minio server /tmp/minio --console-address :9001
```

Complete documentation for building Docker containers, managing custom images, or loading images into orchestration platforms is out of scope for this documentation.
You can modify the `Dockerfile` and `dockerscripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` as-needed to reflect your specific image requirements.

See the [MinIO Container](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/baremetal-deploy-minio-as-a-container.html#deploy-minio-container) documentation for more guidance on running MinIO within a Container image.

## Install using Helm Charts

There are two paths for installing MinIO onto Kubernetes infrastructure:

- Use the [MinIO Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator)
- Use the community-maintained [Helm charts](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/helm/minio)

See the [MinIO Documentation](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/kubernetes.html) for guidance on deploying using the Operator.
The Community Helm chart has instructions in the folder-level README.

## Test MinIO Connectivity

### Test using MinIO Console

MinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser.
Point your web browser to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; to ensure your server has started successfully.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use `--console-address` to pick a specific interface and port.

### Test using MinIO Client `mc`

`mc` provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services.

The following commands set a local alias, validate the server information, create a bucket, copy data to that bucket, and list the contents of the bucket.

```sh
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc admin info
mc mb data
mc cp ~/Downloads/mydata data/
mc ls data/
```

Follow the MinIO Client [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart) for further instructions.

## Retiring

[What You Need to Know about Ingress NGINX Retirement](https://www.kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11/ingress-nginx-retirement/):

* Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026.
* Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered.
* Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will not be broken.
  * Existing project artifacts such as Helm charts and container images will remain available.

## Overview

ingress-nginx was an Ingress controller for Kubernetes using [NGINX](https://www.nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy and load
balancer.

[Learn more about Ingress on the Kubernetes documentation site](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## Usage warnings

If you are not already using ingress-nginx, you should not be deploying it as it is [not being developed](#retiring). Instead you should identify a [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/) implementation and use it.

Do not use in multi-tenant Kubernetes production installations. This project assumes that users that can create Ingress objects are administrators of the cluster. See the [FAQ](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/faq/#faq) for more.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, review the [troubleshooting docs](docs/troubleshooting.md),
[search for an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues), or talk to us on the
[#ingress-nginx-users channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/ingress-nginx-users) on the Kubernetes Slack server.

## Changelog

See [the list of releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases) for all changes.
For detailed changes for each release, please check the [changelog-$version.md](./changelog) file for the release version.
For detailed changes on the `ingress-nginx` helm chart, please check the changelog folder for a specific version.

### 🧵 Threads &amp; Tracing

AxonHub records every request as part of a thread-aware trace without requiring you to adopt any vendor-specific SDK. Bring your existing OpenAI-compatible client, and AxonHub will:

- Require incoming `AH-Trace-Id` headers to stitch multiple requests into the same trace. If the header is omitted, AxonHub will still record the request but cannot automatically link it to related activity.
- Link traces to threads so you can follow the entire conversation journey end to end
- Capture model metadata, prompt / response spans, and timing information for fast root-cause analysis

Learn more about how tracing works and how to integrate it in the [Tracing Guide](docs/en/guides/tracing.md).

### 💰 Cost Tracking

AxonHub provides real-time cost calculation and usage tracking for every request:

- **Multi-dimensional Tracking**: Tracks input (prompt), output (completion), cached (read/write), reasoning, and audio tokens.
- **Precise Calculation**: Real-time cost calculation based on configurable model pricing (price per 1M tokens).
- **Cache Discounts**: Supports specialized pricing for cached tokens to accurately reflect provider cost savings.
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Every request includes a granular cost breakdown (e.g., how much was spent on input vs. output vs. cache).
- **Quota Management**: Aggregate costs across projects and API keys to enforce usage limits and budgets.

### 🔧 API Format Support

| Format                      | Status     | Compatibility       | Modalities      |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| **OpenAI Chat Completions** | ✅ Done    | Fully compatible    | Text, Image     |
| **OpenAI Responses**        | ⚠️ Partial | No `previous_response_id` | Text, Image     |
| **Anthropic Messages**      | ✅ Done    | Fully supported     | Text            |
| **Gemini**                  | ✅ Done    | Fully supported     | Text, Image     |
| **AI SDK**                  | ⚠️ Partial | Partially supported | Text            |

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Unified API Overview

AxonHub provides a unified API gateway that supports both OpenAI Chat Completions and Anthropic Messages APIs. This means you can:

- **Use OpenAI API to call Anthropic models** - Keep using your OpenAI SDK while accessing Claude models
- **Use Anthropic API to call OpenAI models** - Use Anthropic&#039;s native API format with GPT models
- **Use Gemini API to call OpenAI models** - Use Gemini&#039;s native API format with GPT models
- **Automatic API translation** - AxonHub handles format conversion automatically
- **Zero code changes** - Your existing OpenAI or Anthropic client code continues to work

### 1. Initial Setup

1. **Access Management Interface**

   ```
   http://localhost:8090
   ```

2. **Configure AI Providers**

   - Add API keys in the management interface
   - Test connections to ensure correct configuration

3. **Create Users and Roles**
   - Set up permission management
   - Assign appropriate access permissions

### 2. Channel Configuration

Configure AI provider channels in the management interface. For detailed information on channel configuration, including model mappings, parameter overrides, and troubleshooting, see the [Channel Configuration Guide](docs/en/guides/channel-management.md).

### 3. Model Management

AxonHub provides a flexible model management system that supports mapping abstract models to specific channels and model implementations through Model Associations. This enables:

- **Unified Model Interface** - Use abstract model IDs (e.g., `gpt-4`, `claude-3-opus`) instead of channel-specific names
- **Intelligent Channel Selection** - Automatically route requests to optimal channels based on association rules and load balancing
- **Flexible Mapping Strategies** - Support for precise channel-model matching, regex patterns, and tag-based selection
- **Priority-based Fallback** - Configure multiple associations with priorities for automatic failover

For comprehensive information on model management, including association types, configuration examples, and best practices, see the [Model Management Guide](docs/en/guides/model-management.md).

### 4. Create API Keys

Create API keys to authenticate your applications with AxonHub. Each API key can be configured with multiple profiles that define:

- **Model Mappings** - Transform user-requested models to actual available models using exact match or regex patterns
- **Channel Restrictions** - Limit which channels an API key can use by channel IDs or tags
- **Model Access Control** - Control which models are accessible through a specific profile
- **Profile Switching** - Change behavior on-the-fly by activating different profiles

For detailed information on API key profiles, including configuration examples, validation rules, and best practices, see the [API Key Profile Guide](docs/en/guides/api-key-profiles.md).

### 5. Claude Code/Codex Integration

## Overview

This repository contains the majority of Tailscale&#039;s open source code.
Notably, it includes the `tailscaled` daemon and
the `tailscale` CLI tool. The `tailscaled` daemon runs on Linux, Windows,
[macOS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants/), and to varying degrees
on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The Tailscale iOS and Android apps use this repo&#039;s
code, but this repo doesn&#039;t contain the mobile GUI code.

Other [Tailscale repos](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/repositories) of note:

* the Android app is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android
* the Synology package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology
* the QNAP package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-qpkg
* the Chocolatey packaging is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-chocolatey

For background on which parts of Tailscale are open source and why,
see [https://tailscale.com/opensource/](https://tailscale.com/opensource/).

## Using

We serve packages for a variety of distros and platforms at
[https://pkgs.tailscale.com](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/).

## Other clients

The [macOS, iOS, and Windows clients](https://tailscale.com/download)
use the code in this repository but additionally include small GUI
wrappers. The GUI wrappers on non-open source platforms are themselves
not open source.

## Building

We always require the latest Go release, currently Go 1.25. (While we build
releases with our [Go fork](https://github.com/tailscale/go/), its use is not
required.)

```
go install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}
```

If you&#039;re packaging Tailscale for distribution, use `build_dist.sh`
instead, to burn commit IDs and version info into the binaries:

```
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
```

If your distro has conventions that preclude the use of
`build_dist.sh`, please do the equivalent of what it does in your
distro&#039;s way, so that bug reports contain useful version information.

## Bugs

Please file any issues about this code or the hosted service on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).

## Contributing

PRs welcome! But please file bugs. Commit messages should [reference
bugs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls).

We require [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
`Signed-off-by` lines in commits.

See [commit-messages.md](docs/commit-messages.md) (or skim `git log`) for our commit message style.

## Quick Start

### System Requirements

- Go 1.23+ (for source builds)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite (for database storage)
- Redis (for caching and distributed coordination, optional)

### Method 1: Docker Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d --name gpt-load \
    -p 3001:3001 \
    -e AUTH_KEY=your-secure-key-here \
    -v &quot;$(pwd)/data&quot;:/app/data \
    ghcr.io/tbphp/gpt-load:latest
```

&gt; Please change `your-secure-key-here` to a strong password (never use the default value), then you can log in to the management interface: &lt;http://localhost:3001&gt;

### Method 2: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

**Installation Commands:**

```bash
# Create Directory
mkdir -p gpt-load &amp;&amp; cd gpt-load

# Download configuration files
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbphp/gpt-load/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbphp/gpt-load/refs/heads/main/.env.example

# Edit the .env file and change AUTH_KEY to a strong password. Never use default or simple keys like sk-123456.

# Start services
docker compose up -d
```

Before deployment, you must change the default admin key (AUTH_KEY). A recommended format is: sk-prod-[32-character random string].

The default installation uses the SQLite version, which is suitable for lightweight, single-instance applications.

If you need to install MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis, please uncomment the required services in the `docker-compose.yml` file, configure the corresponding environment variables, and restart.

**Other Commands:**

```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Restart Service
docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d

# Update to latest version
docker compose pull &amp;&amp; docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d
```

After deployment:

- Access Web Management Interface: &lt;http://localhost:3001&gt;
- API Proxy Address: &lt;http://localhost:3001/proxy&gt;

&gt; Use your modified AUTH_KEY to log in to the management interface.

### Method 3: Source Build

Source build requires a locally installed database (SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and Redis (optional).

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/tbphp/gpt-load.git
cd gpt-load
go mod tidy

# Create configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and change AUTH_KEY to a strong password. Never use default or simple keys like sk-123456.
# Modify DATABASE_DSN and REDIS_DSN configurations in .env
# REDIS_DSN is optional; if not configured, memory storage will be enabled

# Run
make run
```

After deployment:

- Access Web Management Interface: &lt;http://localhost:3001&gt;
- API Proxy Address: &lt;http://localhost:3001/proxy&gt;

&gt; Use your modified AUTH_KEY to log in to the management interface.

### Method 4: Cluster Deployment

Cluster deployment requires all nodes to connect to the same MySQL (or PostgreSQL) and Redis, with Redis being mandatory. It&#039;s recommended to use unified distributed MySQL and Redis clusters.

**Deployment Requirements:**

- All nodes must configure identical `AUTH_KEY`, `DATABASE_DSN`, `REDIS_DSN`
- Leader-follower architecture where follower nodes must configure environment variable: `IS_SLAVE=true`

For details, please refer to [Cluster Deployment Documentation](https://www.gpt-load.com/docs/cluster?lang=en)

## Configuration System

### Configuration Architecture Overview

GPT-Load adopts a dual-layer configuration architecture:

#### 1. Static Configuration (Environment Variables)

- **Characteristics**: Read at application startup, immutable during runtime, requires application restart to take effect
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure configuration such as database connections, server ports, authentication keys, etc.
- **Management**: Set via `.env` files or system environment variables

#### 2. Dynamic Configuration (Hot-Reload)

- **System Settings**: Stored in database, providing unified behavioral standards for the entire application
- **Group Configuration**: Behavior parameters customized for specific groups, can override system settings
- **Configuration Priority**: Group Configuration &gt; System Settings &gt; Environment Configuration
- **Characteristics**: Supports hot-reload, takes effect immediately after modification without application restart

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Static Configuration (Environment Variables)&lt;/summary&gt;

## Data Encryption Migration

GPT-Load supports encrypted storage of API keys. You can enable, disable, or change the encryption key at any time.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;View Data Encryption Migration Details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Migration Scenarios

- **Enable Encryption**: Encrypt plaintext data for storage - Use `--to &lt;new-key&gt;`
- **Disable Encryption**: Decrypt encrypted data to plaintext - Use `--from &lt;current-key&gt;`
- **Change Encryption Key**: Replace the encryption key - Use `--from &lt;current-key&gt; --to &lt;new-key&gt;`

### Operation Steps

#### Docker Compose Deployment

```bash
# 1. Update the image (ensure using the latest version)
docker compose pull

# 2. Stop the service
docker compose down

# 3. Backup the database (strongly recommended)
# Before migration, you must manually backup the database or export your keys to avoid key loss due to operations or exceptions.

# 4. Execute migration command
# Enable encryption (your-32-char-secret-key is your key, recommend using 32+ character random string)
docker compose run --rm gpt-load migrate-keys --to &quot;your-32-char-secret-key&quot;

# Disable encryption
docker compose run --rm gpt-load migrate-keys --from &quot;your-current-key&quot;

# Change encryption key
docker compose run --rm gpt-load migrate-keys --from &quot;old-key&quot; --to &quot;new-32-char-secret-key&quot;

# 5. Update configuration file
# Edit .env file, set ENCRYPTION_KEY to match the --to parameter
# If disabling encryption, remove ENCRYPTION_KEY or set it to empty
vim .env
# Add or modify: ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-char-secret-key

# 6. Restart the service
docker compose up -d
```

#### Source Build Deployment

```bash
# 1. Stop the service
# Stop the running service process (Ctrl+C or kill process)

# 2. Backup the database (strongly recommended)
# Before migration, you must manually backup the database or export your keys to avoid key loss due to operations or exceptions.

# 3. Execute migration command
# Enable encryption
make migrate-keys ARGS=&quot;--to your-32-char-secret-key&quot;

# Disable encryption
make migrate-keys ARGS=&quot;--from your-current-key&quot;

# Change encryption key
make migrate-keys ARGS=&quot;--from old-key --to new-32-char-secret-key&quot;

# 4. Update configuration file
# Edit .env file, set ENCRYPTION_KEY to match the --to parameter
echo &quot;ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-char-secret-key&quot; &gt;&gt; .env

# 5. Restart the service
make run
```

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Important Reminders**:
- **Once ENCRYPTION_KEY is lost, encrypted data CANNOT be recovered!** Please securely backup this key. Consider using a password manager or secure key management system
- **Service must be stopped** before migration to avoid data inconsistency
- Strongly recommended to **backup the database** in case migration fails and recovery is needed
- Keys should use **32 characters or longer random strings** for security
- Ensure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env` matches the `--to` parameter after migration
- If disabling encryption, remove or clear the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` configuration

### Key Generation Examples

```bash
# Generate secure random key (32 characters)
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d &quot;=+/&quot; | cut -c1-32
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Web Management Interface

Access the management console at: &lt;http://localhost:3001&gt; (default address)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Installation

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose using provided directory structure (recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a new directory called `glance` as well as the template files within it by running:

```bash
mkdir glance &amp;&amp; cd glance &amp;&amp; curl -sL https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xzf - --strip-components 2
```

*[click here to view the files that will be created](https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/tree/main/root)*

Then, edit the following files as desired:
* `docker-compose.yml` to configure the port, volumes and other containery things
* `config/home.yml` to configure the widgets or layout of the home page
* `config/glance.yml` if you want to change the theme or add more pages

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Other files you may want to edit&lt;/summary&gt;

* `.env` to configure environment variables that will be available inside configuration files
* `assets/user.css` to add custom CSS
&lt;/details&gt;

When ready, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose manual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  glance:
    container_name: glance
    image: glanceapp/glance
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Then, create a new directory called `config` and download the example starting [`glance.yml`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/glance.yml) file into it by running:

```bash
mkdir config &amp;&amp; wget -O config/glance.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

Feel free to edit the `glance.yml` file to your liking, and when ready run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker logs glance
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual binary installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Precompiled binaries are available for Linux, Windows and macOS (x86, x86_64, ARM and ARM64 architectures).

### Linux

Visit the [latest release page](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) for available binaries. You can place the binary in `/opt/glance/` and have it start with your server via a [systemd service](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/). By default, when running the binary, it will look for a `glance.yml` file in the directory it&#039;s placed in. To specify a different path for the config file, use the `--config` option:

```bash
/opt/glance/glance --config /etc/glance.yml
```

To grab a starting template for the config file, run:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

### Windows

Download and extract the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) (most likely the file called `glance-windows-amd64.zip` if you&#039;re on a 64-bit system) and place it in a folder of your choice. Then, create a new text file called `glance.yml` in the same folder and paste the content from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml) in it. You should then be able to run the executable and access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.



&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Glance can also be installed through the following 3rd party channels:
* [Proxmox VE Helper Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=glance)
* [NixOS package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&amp;show=glance)
* [Coolify.io](https://coolify.io/docs/services/glance/)

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Common issues
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requests timing out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The most common cause of this is when using Pi-Hole, AdGuard Home or other ad-blocking DNS services, which by default have a fairly low rate limit. Depending on the number of widgets you have in a single page, this limit can very easily be exceeded. To fix this, increase the rate limit in the settings of your DNS service.

If using Podman, in some rare cases the timeout can be caused by an unknown issue, in which case it may be resolved by adding the following to the bottom of your `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
networks:
  podman:
    external: true
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken layout for markets, bookmarks or other widgets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

This is almost always caused by the browser extension Dark Reader. To fix this, disable dark mode for the domain where Glance is hosted.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cannot unmarshal !!map into []glance.page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The most common cause of this is having a `pages` key in your `glance.yml` and then also having a `pages` key inside one of your included pages. To fix this, remove the `pages` key from the top of your included pages.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## FAQ
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the information on the page update automatically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No, a page refresh is required to update the information. Some things do dynamically update where it makes sense, like the clock widget and the relative time showing how long ago something happened.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequently do widgets update?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No requests are made periodically in the background, information is only fetched upon loading the page and then cached. The default cache lifetime is different for each widget and can be configured.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I create my own widgets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, there are multiple ways to create custom widgets:
* `iframe` widget - allows you to embed things from other websites
* `html` widget - allows you to insert your own static HTML
* `extension` widget - fetch HTML from a URL
* `custom-api` widget - fetch JSON from a URL and render it using custom HTML
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I change the title of a widget?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, the title of all widgets can be changed by specifying the `title` property in the widget&#039;s configuration:

```yaml
- type: rss
  title: My custom title

- type: markets
  title: My custom title

- type: videos
  title: My custom title

# and so on for all widgets...
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Feature requests

New feature suggestions are always welcome and will be considered, though please keep in mind that some of them may be out of scope for what the project is trying to achieve (or is reasonably capable of). If you have an idea for a new feature and would like to share it, you can do so [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

Feature requests are tagged with one of the following:

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/roadmap) - will be implemented in a future release
* [Backlog](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/backlog) - may be implemented in the future but needs further feedback or interest from the community
* [Icebox](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/icebox) - no plans to implement as it doesn&#039;t currently align with the project&#039;s goals or capabilities, may be revised at a later date

&lt;br&gt;

## Building from source

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build binary with Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) &gt;= v1.23

To build the project for your current OS and architecture, run:

```bash
go build -o build/glance .
```

To build for a specific OS and architecture, run:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/glance .
```

[*click here for a full list of GOOS and GOARCH combinations*](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#:~:text=$GOOS%20and%20$GOARCH)

Alternatively, if you just want to run the app without creating a binary, like when you&#039;re testing out changes, you can run:

```bash
go run .
```
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build project and Docker image with Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To build the project and image using just Docker, run:

*(replace `owner` with your name or organization)*

```bash
docker build -t owner/glance:latest .
```

If you wish to push the image to a registry (by default Docker Hub), run:

```bash
docker push owner/glance:latest
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Contributing guidelines

* Before working on a new feature it&#039;s preferable to submit a feature request first and state that you&#039;d like to implement it yourself
* Please don&#039;t submit PRs for feature requests that are either in the roadmap&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;, backlog&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; or icebox&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Use `dev` for the base branch if you&#039;re adding new features or fixing bugs, otherwise use `main`
* Avoid introducing new dependencies
* Avoid making backwards-incompatible configuration changes
* Avoid introducing new colors or hard-coding colors, use the standard `primary`, `positive` and `negative`
* For icons, try to use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) where applicable
* Provide a screenshot of the changes if UI related where possible
* No `package.json`

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1] [2] [3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

[1] The feature likely already has work put into it that may conflict with your implementation

[2] The demand, implementation or functionality for this feature is not yet clear

[3] No plans to add this feature for the time being

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## IMPORTANT

**This project is now archived and no longer maintained due to lack of active maintainers and contributors.**

Thank you to everyone who used, starred, or contributed to this project! Feel free to fork this repository if you want to continue development yourself.

Please consider using **[Headlamp](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp)** instead. It was recently moved under the sig-ui. From the creators:
&gt; Headlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI.

## Introduction

Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

As of version 7.0.0, we have dropped support for Manifest-based installation. Only Helm-based installation is supported now. Due to multi-container setup and hard dependency on Kong gateway API proxy
it would not be feasible to easily support Manifest-based installation.

Additionally, we have changed the versioning scheme and dropped `appVersion` from Helm chart. It is because, with a multi-container setup, every module is now versioned separately. Helm chart version
can be considered an app version now.

![Dashboard UI workloads page](docs/images/overview.png)

## Installation

Kubernetes Dashboard supports only Helm-based installation currently as it is faster and gives us better control
over all dependencies required by Dashboard to run. We now use a single-container, DBless [Kong](https://hub.docker.com/r/kong/kong-gateway) installation
as a gateway that connects all our containers and exposes the UI. Users can then use any ingress controller or proxy
in front of kong gateway. To find out more about ways to customize your installation check out [helm chart values](charts/kubernetes-dashboard/values.yaml).

In order to install Kubernetes Dashboard simply run:
```console
# Add kubernetes-dashboard repository
helm repo add kubernetes-dashboard https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/
# Deploy a Helm Release named &quot;kubernetes-dashboard&quot; using the kubernetes-dashboard chart
helm upgrade --install kubernetes-dashboard kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard --create-namespace --namespace kubernetes-dashboard
```

For more information about our Helm chart visit [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/k8s-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard).

# OpenCost — your favorite open source cost monitoring tool for Kubernetes and cloud spend

OpenCost give teams visibility into current and historical Kubernetes and cloud spend and resource allocation.
These models provide cost transparency in Kubernetes environments that support multiple applications, teams, departments, etc.
It also provides visibility into the cloud costs across multiple providers.

OpenCost was originally developed and open sourced by [Kubecost](https://kubecost.com). This project combines a [specification](/spec/) as well as a Golang implementation of these detailed requirements. The web UI is available in the [opencost/opencost-ui](http://github.com/opencost/opencost-ui) repository.

[![OpenCost UI Walkthrough](./ui/src/thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/lCP4Ci9Kcdg)
*OpenCost UI Walkthrough*

To see the full functionality of OpenCost you can view [OpenCost features](https://opencost.io). Here is a summary of features enabled:

- Real-time cost allocation by Kubernetes cluster, node, namespace, controller kind, controller, service, or pod
- Multi-cloud cost monitoring for all cloud services on AWS, Azure, GCP
- Dynamic on-demand k8s asset pricing enabled by integrations with AWS, Azure, and GCP billing APIs
- Supports on-prem k8s clusters with custom CSV pricing
- Allocation for in-cluster K8s resources like CPU, GPU, memory, and persistent volumes
- Easily export pricing data to Prometheus with /metrics endpoint ([learn more](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/prometheus))
- Carbon costs for cloud resources
- MCP support
- Support for external costs like Datadog through [OpenCost Plugins](https://github.com/opencost/opencost-plugins)
- Free and open source distribution ([Apache2 license](LICENSE))

## Getting Started

OpenCost is now installed and managed via the official Helm chart only.

Quick install on any Kubernetes 1.20+ cluster:

```bash
helm repo add opencost https://opencost.github.io/opencost-helm-chart
helm repo update
helm install opencost opencost/opencost
```

Note: The standalone Kubernetes manifest files have been removed. Please use Helm for all installations and upgrades. See the [Helm installation docs](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/install) for details and configuration.

&gt; **Note for sharded Prometheus users:**
&gt; If you run Prometheus in a sharded (HA) setup, set `PROMETHEUS_SERVER_ENDPOINT` to a global query endpoint (e.g., Thanos Query, Cortex, or Mimir). Pointing to a single Prometheus pod may result in incomplete or intermittent export results. See the [Prometheus integration docs](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/prometheus) for details.

## Usage

- [Cost APIs](https://www.opencost.io/docs/integrations/api)
- [CLI / kubectl cost](https://www.opencost.io/docs/integrations/kubectl-cost)
- [Prometheus Metrics](https://www.opencost.io/docs/integrations/prometheus)
- [User Interface](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/ui)

## MCP Server

The OpenCost MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides AI agents with access to cost allocation and asset data through a standardized interface. The MCP server is **enabled by default** in all OpenCost deployments, runs on port 8081, and is **built into the Helm chart** for easy production deployment. Users have full control to disable it or configure custom ports and settings.

### Features

- **Enabled by Default**: MCP server starts automatically with OpenCost
- **Full User Control**: Easy to disable or configure port and settings
- **Allocation Queries**: Retrieve cost allocation data with filtering and aggregation
- **Asset Queries**: Access detailed asset information including nodes, disks, load balancers, and more
- **Cloud Cost Queries**: Query cloud cost data with provider, service, and region filtering
- **HTTP Transport**: Uses HTTP for reliable communication with MCP clients
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with default OpenCost deployment
- **Helm Integration**: Built into the official Helm chart for production deployments

### Quick Start

#### Using Tilt (Development)
```bash
# Clone and start OpenCost with MCP server
# You may also need to clone opencost-ui and opencost-helm-charts repositories
# Make sure the cloned repositories are in the same parent tree as opencost

git clone https://github.com/opencost/opencost.git
cd opencost
tilt up
```
##### Default Configurations
The UI and Prometheus both run on port 9090. You may need to port-forward to a non-default port to access both them at the same time.

Tilt configuration notes (cloud costs):

OpenCost&#039;s Tilt values (`tilt-values.yaml`) include extra environment variables to enable Cloud Cost ingestion in dev:

```yaml
# tilt-values.yaml (excerpt)
opencost:
  exporter:
    extraEnv:
      CLOUD_COST_ENABLED: &quot;true&quot;
      CLOUD_COST_CONFIG_PATH: &quot;/var/cloud-integration/cloud-integration.json&quot;
```

- Set `CLOUD_COST_ENABLED` to &quot;true&quot; to turn on cloud cost ingestion.
- Point `CLOUD_COST_CONFIG_PATH` to the mounted cloud integration file used by Tilt (e.g., `/var/cloud-integration/cloud-integration.json`).
- Adjust other values in `tilt-values.yaml` as needed during development.

#### Using Helm (Production)
```bash
# Add the OpenCost Helm repository
helm repo add opencost https://opencost.github.io/opencost-helm-chart
helm repo update

# Deploy OpenCost with MCP server (enabled by default)
helm install opencost opencost/opencost

# Access MCP server via port forwarding (example)
kubectl port-forward svc/opencost 8081:8081
```

The MCP server is **enabled by default** in the Helm chart. For custom configuration:

```bash
# Deploy with MCP server disabled
helm install opencost opencost/opencost \
  --set opencost.mcp.enabled=false

# Deploy with custom MCP port
helm install opencost opencost/opencost \
  --set opencost.mcp.port=9091

# Deploy with debug logging
helm install opencost opencost/opencost \
  --set opencost.mcp.extraEnv.MCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

#### Configuration Summary

| Configuration | Command | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Default** | `helm install opencost opencost/opencost` | MCP enabled on port 8081 |
| **Disable** | `--set opencost.mcp.enabled=false` | Completely disable MCP server |
| **Custom Port** | `--set opencost.mcp.port=9091` | Use different port |
| **Debug Mode** | `--set opencost.mcp.extraEnv.MCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug` | Enable debug logging |

### MCP Client Configuration

Configure your MCP client (e.g., Cursor) to connect to the OpenCost MCP server:

**Default configuration (port 8081):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;opencost&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8081&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

**Custom port configuration:**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;opencost&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:9091&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

**For Kubernetes deployments:**
```json

&gt; 📢 [ThanosCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/thanoscon/) happened on 19th March 2024 as a co-located half-day on KubeCon EU in Paris.

## Overview

Thanos is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available metric system with unlimited storage capacity, which can be added seamlessly on top of existing Prometheus deployments.

Thanos is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Incubating project.

Thanos leverages the Prometheus 2.0 storage format to cost-efficiently store historical metric data in any object storage while retaining fast query latencies. Additionally, it provides a global query view across all Prometheus installations and can merge data from Prometheus HA pairs on the fly.

Concretely the aims of the project are:

1. Global query view of metrics.
2. Unlimited retention of metrics.
3. High availability of components, including Prometheus.

## Getting Started

* **[Getting Started](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/getting-started.md/)**
* [Design](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/design.md/)
* [Blog posts](docs/getting-started.md#blog-posts)
* [Talks](docs/getting-started.md#talks)
* [Proposals](docs/proposals-done)
* [Integrations](docs/integrations.md)

## Features

* Global querying view across all connected Prometheus servers
* Deduplication and merging of metrics collected from Prometheus HA pairs
* Seamless integration with existing Prometheus setups
* Any object storage as its only, optional dependency
* Downsampling historical data for massive query speedup
* Cross-cluster federation
* Fault-tolerant query routing
* Simple gRPC &quot;Store API&quot; for unified data access across all metric data
* Easy integration points for custom metric providers

## Thanos Philosophy

The philosophy of Thanos and our community is borrowing much from UNIX philosophy and the golang programming language.

* Each subcommand should do one thing and do it well
  * e.g. thanos query proxies incoming calls to known store API endpoints merging the result
* Write components that work together
  * e.g. blocks should be stored in native prometheus format
* Make it easy to read, write, and, run components
  * e.g. reduce complexity in system design and implementation

## Releases

Main branch should be stable and usable. Every commit to main builds docker image named `main-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;sha&gt;` in [quay.io/thanos/thanos](https://quay.io/repository/thanos/thanos) and [thanosio/thanos dockerhub (mirror)](https://hub.docker.com/r/thanosio/thanos)

We also perform minor releases every 6 weeks.

During that, we build tarballs for major platforms and release docker images.

See [release process docs](docs/release-process.md) for details.

## Elevator Pitch

Rant time: You&#039;ve heard it before, git is _powerful_, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? _Are you kidding me?_ To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can&#039;t be split down any further but contains code you don&#039;t want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file _by hand_? _Are you KIDDING me?!_ Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren&#039;t even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? _YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!_

If you&#039;re a mere mortal like me and you&#039;re tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it&#039;s a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.

## Features

### Stage individual lines

Press space on the selected line to stage it, or press `v` to start selecting a range of lines. You can also press `a` to select the entirety of the current hunk.

![stage_lines](../assets/demo/stage_lines-compressed.gif)

### Interactive Rebase

Press `i` to start an interactive rebase. Then squash (`s`), fixup (`f`), drop (`d`), edit (`e`), move up (`ctrl+k`) or move down (`ctrl+j`) any of TODO commits, before continuing the rebase by bringing up the rebase options menu with `m` and then selecting `continue`.

You can also perform any these actions as a once-off (e.g. pressing `s` on a commit to squash it) without explicitly starting a rebase.

This demo also uses shift+down to select a range of commits to move and fixup.

### Cherry-pick

Press `shift+c` on a commit to copy it and press `shift+v` to paste (cherry-pick) it.

![cherry_pick](../assets/demo/cherry_pick-compressed.gif)

### Bisect

Press `b` in the commits view to mark a commit as good/bad in order to begin a git bisect.

![bisect](../assets/demo/bisect-compressed.gif)

### Nuke the working tree

For when you really want to just get rid of anything that shows up when you run `git status` (and yes that includes dirty submodules) [kidpix style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4E2B_k2Bss), press `shift+d` to bring up the reset options menu and then select the &#039;nuke&#039; option.

![Nuke working tree](../assets/demo/nuke_working_tree-compressed.gif)

### Amend an old commit

Pressing `shift+a` on any commit will amend that commit with the currently staged changes (running an interactive rebase in the background).

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

&lt;br/&gt;

Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups of containers.
Podman runs containers on Linux, but can also be used on Mac and Windows systems using a Podman-managed virtual machine.
Podman is based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management that is also contained in this repository. The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes.

Podman releases a new major or minor release 4 times a year, during the second week of February, May, August, and November. Patch releases are more frequent and may occur at any time to get bugfixes out to users. All releases are PGP signed. Public keys of members of the team approved to make releases are located [here](https://github.com/containers/release-keys/tree/main/podman).

* Continuous Integration:
  * [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/containers/podman.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/containers/podman/main)
  * [GoDoc: ![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/containers/podman/libpod?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/containers/podman/libpod)
  * [Downloads](DOWNLOADS.md)

## Overview and scope

At a high level, the scope of Podman and libpod is the following:

* Support for multiple container image formats, including OCI and Docker images.
* Full management of those images, including pulling from various sources (including trust and verification), creating (built via Containerfile or Dockerfile or committed from a container), and pushing to registries and other storage backends.
* Full management of container lifecycle, including creation (both from an image and from an exploded root filesystem), running, checkpointing and restoring (via CRIU), and removal.
* Full management of container networking, using Netavark.
* Support for pods, groups of containers that share resources and are managed together.
* Support for running containers and pods without root or other elevated privileges.
* Resource isolation of containers and pods.
* Support for a Docker-compatible CLI interface, which can both run containers locally and on remote systems.
* No manager daemon, for improved security and lower resource utilization at idle.
* Support for a REST API providing both a Docker-compatible interface and an improved interface exposing advanced Podman functionality.
* Support for running on Windows and Mac via virtual machines run by `podman machine`.

## Roadmap

The future of Podman feature development can be found in its **[roadmap](ROADMAP.md)**.

## Communications

If you think you&#039;ve identified a security issue in the project, please *DO NOT* report the issue publicly via the GitHub issue tracker, mailing list, or IRC.
Instead, send an email with as many details as possible to `security@lists.podman.io`. This is a private mailing list for the core maintainers.

For general questions and discussion, please use Podman&#039;s
[channels](https://podman.io/community/#slack-irc-matrix-and-discord).

For discussions around issues/bugs and features, you can use the GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues)
and
[PRs](https://github.com/containers/podman/pulls)
tracking system.

There is also a [mailing list](https://lists.podman.io/archives/) at `lists.podman.io`.
You can subscribe by sending a message to `podman-join@lists.podman.io` with the subject `subscribe`.

## Rootless
Podman can be easily run as a normal user, without requiring a setuid binary.
When run without root, Podman containers use user namespaces to set root in the container to the user running Podman.
Rootless Podman runs locked-down containers with no privileges that the user running the container does not have.
Some of these restrictions can be lifted (via `--privileged`, for example), but rootless containers will never have more privileges than the user that launched them.
If you run Podman as your user and mount in `/etc/passwd` from the host, you still won&#039;t be able to change it, since your user doesn&#039;t have permission to do so.

Almost all normal Podman functionality is available, though there are some [shortcomings](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/rootless.md).
Any recent Podman release should be able to run rootless without any additional configuration, though your operating system may require some additional configuration detailed in the [install guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

A little configuration by an administrator is required before rootless Podman can be used, the necessary setup is documented [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md).

## Podman Desktop

[Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) provides a local development environment for Podman and Kubernetes on Linux, Windows, and Mac machines.
It is a full-featured desktop UI frontend for Podman which uses the `podman machine` backend on non-Linux operating systems to run containers.
It supports full container lifecycle management (building, pulling, and pushing images, creating and managing containers, creating and managing pods, and working with Kubernetes YAML).
The project develops on [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop) and contributions are welcome.

## Out of scope

* Specialized signing and pushing of images to various storage backends.
  See [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/) for those tasks.
* Support for the Kubernetes CRI interface for container management.
  The [CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) daemon specializes in that.

## OCI Projects Plans

Podman uses OCI projects and best of breed libraries for different aspects:
- Runtime: We use the [OCI runtime tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) to generate OCI runtime configurations that can be used with any OCI-compliant runtime, like [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun/) and [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/).
- Images: Image management uses the [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image) library.
- Storage: Container and image storage is managed by [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage).
- Networking: Networking support through use of [Netavark](https://github.com/containers/netavark) and [Aardvark](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns).  Rootless networking is handled via [pasta](https://passt.top/passt) or [slirp4netns](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns).
- Builds: Builds are supported via [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah).
- Conmon: [Conmon](https://github.com/containers/conmon) is a tool for monitoring OCI runtimes, used by both Podman and CRI-O.
- Seccomp: A unified [Seccomp](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/pkg/seccomp/seccomp.json) policy for Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O.

## Buildah and Podman relationship

Buildah and Podman are two complementary open-source projects that are
available on most Linux platforms and both projects reside at
[GitHub.com](https://github.com) with Buildah
[here](https://github.com/containers/buildah) and Podman
[here](https://github.com/containers/podman).  Both, Buildah and Podman are
command line tools that work on Open Container Initiative (OCI) images and
containers.  The two projects differentiate in their specialization.

Buildah specializes in building OCI images.  Buildah&#039;s commands replicate all
of the commands that are found in a Dockerfile.  This allows building images
with and without Dockerfiles while not requiring any root privileges.
Buildah’s ultimate goal is to provide a lower-level coreutils interface to
build images.  The flexibility of building images without Dockerfiles allows
for the integration of other scripting languages into the build process.
Buildah follows a simple fork-exec model and does not run as a daemon
but it is based on a comprehensive API in golang, which can be vendored
into other tools.

Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify
OCI images, such as pulling and tagging.  It also allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers
created from those images.  For building container images via Dockerfiles, Podman uses Buildah&#039;s
golang API and can be installed independently from Buildah.

A major difference between Podman and Buildah is their concept of a container.  Podman
allows users to create &quot;traditional containers&quot; where the intent of these containers is
to be long lived.  While Buildah containers are really just created to allow content
to be added back to the container image.  An easy way to think of it is the
`buildah run` command emulates the RUN command in a Dockerfile while the `podman run`
command emulates the `docker run` command in functionality.  Because of this and their underlying
storage differences, you can not see Podman containers from within Buildah or vice versa.

In short, Buildah is an efficient way to create OCI images while Podman allows
you to manage and maintain those images and containers in a production environment using
familiar container cli commands.  For more details, see the
[Container Tools Guide](https://github.com/containers/buildah/tree/main/docs/containertools).

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Slack Workspaces. The most powerful MCP Slack server — supports Stdio, SSE and HTTP transports, proxy settings, DMs, Group DMs, Smart History fetch (by date or count), may work via OAuth or in complete stealth mode with no permissions and scopes in Workspace 😏.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]  
&gt; We need your support! Each month, over 30,000 engineers visit this repository, and more than 9,000 are already using it.
&gt; 
&gt; If you appreciate the work our [contributors](https://github.com/korotovsky/slack-mcp-server/graphs/contributors) have put into this project, please consider giving the repository a star.

This feature-rich Slack MCP Server has:
- **Stealth and OAuth Modes**: Run the server without requiring additional permissions or bot installations (stealth mode), or use secure OAuth tokens for access without needing to refresh or extract tokens from the browser (OAuth mode).
- **Enterprise Workspaces Support**: Possibility to integrate with Enterprise Slack setups.
- **Channel and Thread Support with `#Name` `@Lookup`**: Fetch messages from channels and threads, including activity messages, and retrieve channels using their names (e.g., #general) as well as their IDs.
- **Smart History**: Fetch messages with pagination by date (d1, 7d, 1m) or message count.
- **Search Messages**: Search messages in channels, threads, and DMs using various filters like date, user, and content.
- **Safe Message Posting**: The `conversations_add_message` tool is disabled by default for safety. Enable it via an environment variable, with optional channel restrictions.
- **DM and Group DM support**: Retrieve direct messages and group direct messages.
- **Embedded user information**: Embed user information in messages, for better context.
- **Cache support**: Cache users and channels for faster access.
- **Stdio/SSE/HTTP Transports &amp; Proxy Support**: Use the server with any MCP client that supports Stdio, SSE or HTTP transports, and configure it to route outgoing requests through a proxy if needed.

## What is Argo Workflows?

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.
Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

* Define workflows where each step is a container.
* Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
* Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.

Argo is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/) graduated project.

## Use Cases

* [Machine Learning pipelines](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/machine-learning/)
* [Data and batch processing](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/data-processing/)
* [Infrastructure automation](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/infrastructure-automation/)
* [CI/CD](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/ci-cd/)
* [Other use cases](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/other/)

## Why Argo Workflows?

* Argo Workflows is the most popular workflow execution engine for Kubernetes.
* Light-weight, scalable, and easier to use.
    * Including for Python users through [the Hera Python SDK for Argo Workflows](https://hera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
* Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
* Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.

Trivy ([pronunciation][pronunciation]) is a comprehensive and versatile security scanner.
Trivy has *scanners* that look for security issues, and *targets* where it can find those issues.

Targets (what Trivy can scan):

- Container Image
- Filesystem
- Git Repository (remote)
- Virtual Machine Image
- Kubernetes

Scanners (what Trivy can find there):

- OS packages and software dependencies in use (SBOM)
- Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- IaC issues and misconfigurations
- Sensitive information and secrets
- Software licenses

Trivy supports most popular programming languages, operating systems, and platforms. For a complete list, see the [Scanning Coverage] page.
