## Sponsorship

&lt;img src=&quot;assets/github/evcc-gopher.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;

evcc believes in open source software. We&#039;re committed to provide best in class EV charging experience.
Maintaining evcc consumes time and effort. With the vast amount of different devices to support, we depend on community and vendor support to keep evcc alive.

While evcc is open source, we would also like to encourage vendors to provide open source hardware devices, public documentation and support open source projects like ours that provide additional value to otherwise closed hardware. Where this is not the case, evcc requires &quot;sponsor token&quot; to finance ongoing development and support of evcc.

PhotoPrism¬Æ is an AI-Powered Photos App for the [Decentralized Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_web).
It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find pictures automatically without getting in your way.
You can run it at home, on a private server, or in the cloud.

![](https://dl.photoprism.app/img/ui/2025/desktop-search.jpg)

To get a first impression, you are welcome to play with our [public demo](https://try.photoprism.app/). Please be careful not to upload any private, unlawful or offensive pictures.

## Feature Overview ##

**Our mission is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible.** That&#039;s why PhotoPrism was built from the ground up to run wherever you need it, without compromising freedom, privacy, or functionality:

&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://dl.photoprism.app/img/ui/2025/iphone-crocus-540px.png&quot;&gt;

* Browse [all your pictures](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/organize/browse/) without worrying about [RAW images](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/file-formats) or [video formats](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/organize/video/)
* Whether you&#039;re using a phone, tablet, or desktop computer, our [intuitive PWA](https://try.photoprism.app/) provides a native app-like experience and can be [easily installed](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/pwa/) on your home screen
* Quickly find specific photos and videos with [powerful search filters](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/search/filters/) that can be combined and are available for [many different properties](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/search/filters/#filter-reference), including [labels](https://try.photoprism.app/library/labels), [location](https://try.photoprism.app/library/places?q=s2:47a85a63f764), [resolution](https://try.photoprism.app/library/browse?view=cards&amp;q=mp:4), [color](https://try.photoprism.app/library/browse?view=cards&amp;q=color:red), [chroma](https://try.photoprism.app/library/browse?view=cards&amp;q=mono%3Atrue), and [quality](https://try.photoprism.app/library/review)
* [Automatically labels your pictures](https://try.photoprism.app/library/labels) based on content and location, and recognizes the faces of [your family and friends](https://try.photoprism.app/library/people/new)
* [Live Photos](https://try.photoprism.app/library/live) start playing when you [hover over them](https://try.photoprism.app/library/browse?view=cards&amp;q=type%3Alive) and when viewing a slideshow
* Six high-resolution [World Maps](https://try.photoprism.app/library/places) and our [privacy-preserving geocoding service](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/#maps-places) help bring back memories of your favorite trips and let you explore the world
* Metadata can be extracted and merged from Exif, XMP, and other sources like Google Photos
* [Use compatible apps](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/native-apps/) like [PhotoSync](https://link.photoprism.app/photosync) to back up iOS and Android phones in the background
* WebDAV clients such as [Microsoft&#039;s Windows Explorer](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/sync/webdav/#__tabbed_1_2) and [Apple&#039;s Finder](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/sync/webdav/#connect-to-a-webdav-server) can [connect directly to PhotoPrism](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/sync/webdav/), allowing you to open, edit, and delete files from your computer as if they were local

Being completely [**self-funded and independent**](https://link.photoprism.app/membership), we can promise you that we will [never sell your data](https://www.photoprism.app/privacy) and that we will [always be transparent](https://www.photoprism.app/terms) about our software and services. Your data will never be shared with Google, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple unless you intentionally upload files to one of their services. üîí

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step [installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) for our self-hosted [community edition](https://link.photoprism.app/personal-editions) can be found on [docs.photoprism.app](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) - all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The [stable releases](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/) and [development preview](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/updates/#development-preview) are available as a [multi-arch image](https://link.photoprism.app/docker-hub) for 64-bit AMD, Intel, and ARM processors.
That means, [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/) and Apple Silicon users enjoy the exact same functionality and can follow the same [installation steps](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/).

See our [Getting Started FAQ](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-install-photoprism-without-docker) for alternative installation methods, for example using the [*tar.gz* packages](https://dl.photoprism.app/pkg/linux/README.html) we provide.

## Getting Support ##

Visit [docs.photoprism.app/user-guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/) to learn how to [sync](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/sync/webdav/), [organize](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/library/), and [share](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/share/) your pictures. If you need help installing our software at home, you are welcome to post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) or ask in our [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat).
Common problems can be quickly diagnosed and solved using our [Troubleshooting Checklists](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/). Eligible [members](https://link.photoprism.app/membership) are also welcome to email us for technical support and advice.

## Upcoming Features and Enhancements ##

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/photoprism/projects/5&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://dl.photoprism.app/img/ui/2025/upcoming-features-240px.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Our [Project Roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress and what features will be implemented next. You are invited to give ideas you like a thumbs-up, so we know what&#039;s most popular.

Be aware that we have a zero-bug policy and do our best to help users when they need support or have other questions. This comes at a price though, as we can&#039;t give exact release dates for new features. Our team receives many more requests than can be implemented, so we want to emphasize that we are in no way obligated to implement the features, enhancements, or other changes you request. We do, however, appreciate your feedback and carefully consider all requests.

**Because sustained funding is key to quickly releasing new features, we encourage you to support our mission by [signing up for a personal membership](https://link.photoprism.app/membership) or [purchasing a commercial license](https://www.photoprism.app/teams#compare).**

## GitHub Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è ##

We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app. Thank you for your careful consideration!

- When browsing issues, please note that **our team and all issue subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for [discussions, questions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions), or [expressing personal opinions](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct)
- In order for us to investigate [new bug reports](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs), they must include **a complete list of steps to reproduce the problem**, the software versions used and information about the environment in which the problem occurred, such as [browser type, browser version, browser plug-ins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [processor type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu), and [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory)
- [Contact us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives us the opportunity to [improve our documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support instead of dealing with unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by replying to comments

[Keploy](https://keploy.io) is a **developer‚Äëcentric API and integration testing tool** that auto‚Äëgenerates **tests and data‚Äëmocks** faster than unit tests.  

It records API calls, database queries, and streaming events ‚Äî then replays them as tests. Under the hood, Keploy **uses eBPF to capture traffic at the network layer,** but for you it‚Äôs completely **code‚Äëless** and **language‚Äëagnostic**.


&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/docs/main/static/gif/record-replay.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Convert API calls to API tests test cases and Data Mocks using AI&quot;/&gt;

&gt; üê∞ **Fun fact:** Keploy uses itself for testing! Check out our swanky coverage badge: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/keploy/keploy/badge.svg?branch=main&amp;kill_cache=1)](https://coveralls.io/github/keploy/keploy?branch=main&amp;kill_cache=1) &amp;nbsp;

# Key Highlights

## üéØ No code changes

Just run your app with `keploy record`. Real API + integration flows are automatically captured as tests and mocks. *(Keploy uses eBPF under the hood to capture traffic, so you **don‚Äôt need** to add any SDKs or modify code.)* 

## üìπ Record and Replay complex Flows
Keploy can record and replay complex, distributed API flows as mocks and stubs.  It&#039;s like having a very light-weight time machine for your tests‚Äîsaving you tons of time!

üëâ [Read the docs on record-replay](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-explained/introduction/)

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/docs/main/static/gif/record-tc.gif&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; alt=&quot;Convert API calls to test cases&quot;/&gt;

## üêá Complete Infra‚ÄëVirtualization (beyond HTTP mocks)

Unlike tools that only mock HTTP endpoints, Keploy records **databases** (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB), **streaming/queues** (Kafka, RabbitMQ), external APIs, and more. 

It replays them deterministically so you can run tests without re‚Äëprovisioning infra.

üëâ [Read the docs on infra virtualisation](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-explained/how-keploy-works/)

&lt;img src=&quot;https://keploy-devrel.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Group+1261152745.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Convert API calls to test cases&quot;/&gt;

## üß™ Combined Test Coverage

If you‚Äôre a **developer**, you probably care about *statement* and *branch* coverage ‚Äî Keploy calculates that for you. 

If you‚Äôre a **QA**, you focus more on *API schema* and *business use‚Äëcase coverage* ‚Äî Keploy calculates that too. This way coverage isn‚Äôt subjective anymore. 

üëâ [Read the docs on coverage](https://keploy.io/docs/server/sdk-installation/go/)

&lt;img src=&quot;https://keploy-devrel.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/keploy+ai+test+gen+for+api+statement+schema+and+branch+coverage.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;ai test gen for api statement schema and branch coverage&quot;/&gt;

## ü§ñ Expand API Coverage using AI

Keploy uses existing recordings, Swagger/OpenAPI Schema to find: boundary values, missing/extra fields, wrong types, out‚Äëof‚Äëorder sequences, retries/timeouts. 

This helps expand API Schema, Statement, and Branch Coverage.

### Other Capabilities

- üåê **CI/CD Integration:** Run tests with mocks anywhere you like‚Äîlocally on the CLI, in your CI pipeline (Jenkins, Github Actions..) , or even across a Kubernetes cluster. [Read more](https://keploy.io/docs/running-keploy/api-testing-cicd/)

- üé≠ **Multi-Purpose Mocks**: You can also use Keploy-generated Mocks, as server Tests!

- üìä **Reporting:** Unified reports for API, integration, unit, and e2e coverage with insights directly in your CI or PRs.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Console:** A developer-friendly console to view, manage, and debug recorded tests and mocks.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Freezing:** Deterministically replay tests by freezing system time during execution. [Read more](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-cloud/time-freezing/)
- üìö **Mock Registry:** Centralized registry to manage, reuse, and version mocks across teams and environments. [Read more](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-cloud/mock-registry/)

## Languages &amp;amp; Frameworks (Any stack)

Because Keploy intercepts at the **network layer (eBPF)**, it works with **any language, framework, or runtime**‚Äîno SDK required. 
&gt; Note: Some of the dependencies are not open-source by nature because their protocols and parsings are not open-sourced. It&#039;s not supported in Keploy enterprise.

**LocalAI** is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that&#039;s compatible with OpenAI (Elevenlabs, Anthropic... ) API specifications for local AI inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families. Does not require GPU. It is created and maintained by [Ettore Di Giacinto](https://github.com/mudler).

## About

PhoneInfoga is one of the most advanced tools to scan international phone numbers. It allows you to first gather basic information such as country, area, carrier and line type, then use various techniques to try to find the VoIP provider or identify the owner. It works with a collection of scanners that must be configured in order for the tool to be effective. PhoneInfoga doesn&#039;t automate everything, it&#039;s just there to help investigating on phone numbers.

## Current status

This project is stable and production-ready.

#### Demo instance termination

The demo instance has been terminated on December 21th, 2023. It&#039;s been expensive to maintain this instance throughout the years given the number of requests it received (~20K/month), without bringing much value to users compared to using it locally. Use it locally with your own API keys for a better experience.

## Features

- Check if phone number exists
- Gather basic information such as country, line type and carrier
- OSINT footprinting using external APIs, phone books &amp; search engines
- Check for reputation reports, social media, disposable numbers and more
- Use the graphical user interface to run scans from the browser
- Programmatic usage with the [REST API](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sundowndev/phoneinfoga/master/web/docs/swagger.yaml) and [Go modules](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sundowndev/phoneinfoga/v2)

## Anti-features

- Does not claim to provide relevant or verified data, it&#039;s just a tool !
- Does not allow to &quot;track&quot; a phone or its owner in real time
- Does not allow to get the precise phone location
- Does not allow to hack a phone

[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/?ref=github-inngest-readme)&#039;s durable functions replace queues, state management, and scheduling to enable any developer to write reliable step functions faster without touching infrastructure.

1. Write durable functions using any of [**our language SDKs**](#sdks)
2. Run the [**Inngest Dev Server**](#getting-started) for a complete local development experience, with production parity.
3. Deploy your functions to your own infrastructure
4. Sync your application&#039;s functions with the [**Inngest Platform**](https://www.inngest.com/?ref=github-inngest-readme) or a [self-hosted Inngest server](#self-hosting).
5. Inngest invokes your functions securely via HTTPS whenever triggering events are received.

### An example durable function

Inngest Functions enable developers to run reliable background logic, from background jobs to complex workflows. An Inngest Function is composed of three key parts that provide robust support for retrying, scheduling, and coordinating complex sequences of operations:

- [**Triggers**](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Events, Cron schedules or webhook events that trigger the function.
- [**Flow Control**](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Configure how the function runs are enqueued and executed including concurrency, throttling, debouncing, rate limiting, and prioritization.
- [**Steps**](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows?ref=github-inngest-readme) - Steps are fundamental building blocks of Inngest, turning your Inngest Functions into reliable workflows that can runs for months and recover from failures.

Here is an example function that limits concurrency for each unique user id and performs two steps that will be retried on error:

```typescript
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: &quot;import-product-images&quot;,
    concurrency: {
      key: &quot;event.data.userId&quot;,
      limit: 10
    }
  },
  { event: &quot;shop/product.imported&quot; },
  async ({ event, step }) =&gt; {
    // Here goes the business logic
    // By wrapping code in steps, each will be retried automatically on failure
    const s3Urls = await step.run(&quot;copy-images-to-s3&quot;, async () =&gt; {
      return copyAllImagesToS3(event.data.imageURLs);
    });
    // You can include numerous steps in your function
    await step.run(&quot;resize-images&quot;, async () =&gt; {
      await resizer.bulk({ urls: s3Urls, quality: 0.9, maxWidth: 1024 });
    })
  };
);

// Elsewhere in your code (e.g. in your API endpoint):
await inngest.send({
  name: &quot;shop/product.imported&quot;,
  data: {
    userId: &quot;01J8G44701QYGE0DH65PZM8DPM&quot;,
    imageURLs: [
      &quot;https://useruploads.acme.com/q2345678/1094.jpg&quot;,
      &quot;https://useruploads.acme.com/q2345678/1095.jpg&quot;
    ],
  },
});
```

## Project Architecture

To understand how self-hosting works, it&#039;s valuable to understand the architecture and system components at a high level. We&#039;ll take a look at a simplified architecture diagram and walk through the system.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/architecture-2024-09-23.png&quot; alt=&quot;System Architecture&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- **Event API** - Receives events from SDKs via HTTP requests. Authenticates client requests via [Event Keys](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events/creating-an-event-key?ref=github-inngest-readme). The Event API publishes event payloads to an internal event stream.
- **Event stream** - Acts as buffer between the _Event API_ and the _Runner_.
- **Runner** - Consumes incoming events and performs several actions:
  - Scheduling of new ‚Äúfunction runs‚Äù (aka jobs) given the event type, creating initial run state in the _State store_ database. Runs are added to queues given the function&#039;s flow control configuration.
  - Resume functions paused via [`waitForEvent`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/wait-for-event?ref=github-inngest-readme) with matching expressions.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

&lt;br&gt;

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

## What is Higress?

Higress is a cloud-native API gateway based on Istio and Envoy, which can be extended with Wasm plugins written in Go/Rust/JS. It provides dozens of ready-to-use general-purpose plugins and an out-of-the-box console (try the [demo here](http://demo.higress.io/)).

### Core Use Cases

Higress&#039;s AI gateway capabilities support all [mainstream model providers](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/tree/main/plugins/wasm-go/extensions/ai-proxy/provider) both domestic and international. It also supports hosting MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers through its plugin mechanism, enabling AI Agents to easily call various tools and services. With the [openapi-to-mcp tool](https://github.com/higress-group/openapi-to-mcpserver), you can quickly convert OpenAPI specifications into remote MCP servers for hosting. Higress provides unified management for both LLM API and MCP API.

## Quick Start

Higress can be started with just Docker, making it convenient for individual developers to set up locally for learning or for building simple sites:

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir higress; cd higress
# Start higress, configuration files will be written to the working directory
docker run -d --rm --name higress-ai -v ${PWD}:/data \
        -p 8001:8001 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443  \
        higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/higress/all-in-one:latest
```

Port descriptions:

- Port 8001: Higress UI console entry
- Port 8080: Gateway HTTP protocol entry
- Port 8443: Gateway HTTPS protocol entry

&gt; All Higress Docker images use Higress&#039;s own image repository and are not affected by Docker Hub rate limits.
&gt; In addition, the submission and updates of the images are protected by a security scanning mechanism (powered by Alibaba Cloud ACR), making them very secure for use in production environments.
&gt; 
&gt; If you experience a timeout when pulling image from `higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com`, you can try replacing it with the following docker registry mirror source:
&gt; 
&gt; **Southeast Asia**: `higress-registry.ap-southeast-7.cr.aliyuncs.com`

For other installation methods such as Helm deployment under K8s, please refer to the official [Quick Start documentation](https://higress.io/en-us/docs/user/quickstart).

Private WireGuard¬Æ networks made easy

## Overview

This repository contains the majority of Tailscale&#039;s open source code.
Notably, it includes the `tailscaled` daemon and
the `tailscale` CLI tool. The `tailscaled` daemon runs on Linux, Windows,
[macOS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants/), and to varying degrees
on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The Tailscale iOS and Android apps use this repo&#039;s
code, but this repo doesn&#039;t contain the mobile GUI code.

Other [Tailscale repos](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/repositories) of note:

* the Android app is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android
* the Synology package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology
* the QNAP package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-qpkg
* the Chocolatey packaging is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-chocolatey

For background on which parts of Tailscale are open source and why,
see [https://tailscale.com/opensource/](https://tailscale.com/opensource/).

## Using

We serve packages for a variety of distros and platforms at
[https://pkgs.tailscale.com](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/).

## Other clients

The [macOS, iOS, and Windows clients](https://tailscale.com/download)
use the code in this repository but additionally include small GUI
wrappers. The GUI wrappers on non-open source platforms are themselves
not open source.

## Building

We always require the latest Go release, currently Go 1.25. (While we build
releases with our [Go fork](https://github.com/tailscale/go/), its use is not
required.)

```
go install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}
```

If you&#039;re packaging Tailscale for distribution, use `build_dist.sh`
instead, to burn commit IDs and version info into the binaries:

```
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
```

If your distro has conventions that preclude the use of
`build_dist.sh`, please do the equivalent of what it does in your
distro&#039;s way, so that bug reports contain useful version information.

## Bugs

Please file any issues about this code or the hosted service on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).

## Contributing

PRs welcome! But please file bugs. Commit messages should [reference
bugs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls).

We require [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
`Signed-off-by` lines in commits.

See [commit-messages.md](docs/commit-messages.md) (or skim `git log`) for our commit message style.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## BNB Smart Chain

The goal of BNB Smart Chain is to bring programmability and interoperability to BNB Beacon Chain. In order to embrace the existing popular community and advanced technology, it will bring huge benefits by staying compatible with all the existing smart contracts on Ethereum and Ethereum tooling. And to achieve that, the easiest solution is to develop based on go-ethereum fork, as we respect the great work of Ethereum very much.

BNB Smart Chain starts its development based on go-ethereum fork. So you may see many toolings, binaries and also docs are based on Ethereum ones, such as the name &quot;geth&quot;.

[![API Reference](
https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum?tab=doc)
[![Build Test](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/actions/workflows/build-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/actions)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join%20chat-blue.svg)](https://discord.gg/z2VpC455eU)

But from that baseline of EVM compatible, BNB Smart Chain introduces a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.

**The BNB Smart Chain** will be:

- **A self-sovereign blockchain**: Provides security and safety with elected validators.
- **EVM-compatible**: Supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster finality and cheaper transaction fees.
- **Distributed with on-chain governance**: Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community participants. As the native token, BNB will serve as both the gas of smart contract execution and tokens for staking.

More details in [White Paper](https://github.com/bnb-chain/whitepaper/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md).

## Release Types
There are three types of release, each with a clear purpose and version scheme:

- **1.Stable Release**: production-ready builds for the vast majority of users.  Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;`, example: [v1.5.19](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.19).
- **2.Feature Release**: early access to a single feature without affecting the core product. Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;-feature-&lt;FeatureName&gt;`, example: [v1.5.19-feature-SI](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.19-feature-SI).
- **3.Preview Release**: bleeding-edge builds for users who want the latest code. Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;-&lt;Meta&gt;`, Meta values indicate maturity: alpha (experimental), beta (largely complete), rc (release candidate), example: [v1.5.0-alpha](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.0-alpha).

## Key features

### Proof of Staked Authority 
Although Proof-of-Work (PoW) has been approved as a practical mechanism to implement a decentralized network, it is not friendly to the environment and also requires a large size of participants to maintain the security. 

Proof-of-Authority(PoA) provides some defense to 51% attack, with improved efficiency and tolerance to certain levels of Byzantine players (malicious or hacked). 
Meanwhile, the PoA protocol is most criticized for being not as decentralized as PoW, as the validators, i.e. the nodes that take turns to produce blocks, have all the authorities and are prone to corruption and security attacks.

Other blockchains, such as EOS and Cosmos both, introduce different types of Deputy Proof of Stake (DPoS) to allow the token holders to vote and elect the validator set. It increases the decentralization and favors community governance. 

To combine DPoS and PoA for consensus, BNB Smart Chain implement a novel consensus engine called Parlia that:

1. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators.
2. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner, similar to Ethereum&#039;s Clique consensus engine.
3. Validator set are elected in and out based on a staking based governance on BNB Smart Chain.
4. Parlia consensus engine will interact with a set of [system contracts](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/staking/overview/#system-contracts) to achieve liveness slash, revenue distributing and validator set renewing func.

## Native Token

BNB will run on BNB Smart Chain in the same way as ETH runs on Ethereum so that it remains as `native token` for BSC. This means,
BNB will be used to:

1. pay `gas` to deploy or invoke Smart Contract on BSC

## Building the source

Many of the below are the same as or similar to go-ethereum.

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.24 or later) and a C compiler (GCC 5 or higher). You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

If you get such error when running the node with self built binary:
```shell
Caught SIGILL in blst_cgo_init, consult &lt;blst&gt;/bindinds/go/README.md.
```
please try to add the following environment variables and build again:
```shell
export CGO_CFLAGS=&quot;-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__&quot; 
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW=&quot;-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__&quot;
```

## Executables

The bsc project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  Command   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **`geth`** | Main BNB Smart Chain client binary. It is the entry point into the BSC network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It has the same and more RPC and other interface as go-ethereum and can be used by other processes as a gateway into the BSC network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options. |
|   `clef`   | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  `devp2p`  | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  `abigen`  | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) page for details.                                                                                               |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   `evm`    | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we&#039;ve enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

The hardware must meet certain requirements to run a full node on mainnet:
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
- IMPORTANT 3 TB(Dec 2023) of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 500 MB/S throughput, read latency &lt;1ms. (if node is started with snap sync, it will need NVMe SSD)
- 16 cores of CPU and 64 GB of memory (RAM)
- Suggest m5zn.6xlarge or r7iz.4xlarge instance type on AWS, c2-standard-16 on Google cloud.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 5 MB/S

The requirement for testnet:
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
- 500G of storage for testnet.
- 4 cores of CPU and 16 gigabytes of memory (RAM).

### Steps to Run a Fullnode

#### 1. Download the pre-build binaries
```shell
# Linux
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_linux |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
mv geth_linux geth
chmod -v u+x geth

# MacOS
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_mac |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
mv geth_macos geth
chmod -v u+x geth
```

#### 2. Download the config files
```shell
//== mainnet
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mainnet |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
unzip mainnet.zip

//== testnet
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep testnet |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
unzip testnet.zip
```

#### 3. Download snapshot
Download latest chaindata snapshot from [here](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-snapshots). Follow the guide to structure your files.

#### 4. Start a full node
```shell
## It will run with Path-Base Storage Scheme by default and enable inline state prune, keeping the latest 90000 blocks&#039; history state.
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --history.transactions 0

## It is recommend to run fullnode with `--tries-verify-mode none` if you want high performance and care little about state consistency.
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --history.transactions 0 --tries-verify-mode none
```

#### 5. Monitor node status

Monitor the log from **./node/bsc.log** by default. When the node has started syncing, should be able to see the following output:
```shell
t=2022-09-08T13:00:27+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=177   mgas=17.317   elapsed=31.131ms    mgasps=556.259  number=21,153,429 hash=0x42e6b54ba7106387f0650defc62c9ace3160b427702dab7bd1c5abb83a32d8db dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
t=2022-09-08T13:00:29+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=251   mgas=39.638   elapsed=68.827ms    mgasps=575.900  number=21,153,430 hash=0xa3397b273b31b013e43487689782f20c03f47525b4cd4107c1715af45a88796e dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
t=2022-09-08T13:00:33+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=197   mgas=19.364   elapsed=34.663ms    mgasps=558.632  number=21,153,431 hash=0x0c7872b698f28cb5c36a8a3e1e315b1d31bda6109b15467a9735a12380e2ad14 dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
```

#### 6. Interact with fullnode
Start up `geth`&#039;s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/javascript-console),
(via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/) 
(note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
as well as `geth`&#039;s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server).
This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
`geth` instance with `geth attach`.

#### 7. More

More details about [running a node](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/developers/node_operators/full_node/) and [becoming a validator](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/validator/create-val/)

*Note: Although some internal protective measures prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should always
use separate accounts for play and real money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you&#039;ll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
BSC network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/),
[`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc), and [BSC&#039;s JSON-RPC API Reference](rpc/json-rpc-api.md)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you&#039;d expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API&#039;s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API&#039;s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You&#039;ll need to use your own programming environments&#039; capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you&#039;ll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
BSC nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

## Running a bootnode

Bootnodes are super-lightweight nodes that are not behind a NAT and are running just discovery protocol. When you start up a node it should log your enode, which is a public identifier that others can use to connect to your node. 

First the bootnode requires a key, which can be created with the following command, which will save a key to boot.key:

```
bootnode -genkey boot.key
```

This key can then be used to generate a bootnode as follows:

```
bootnode -nodekey boot.key -addr :30311 -network bsc
```

The choice of port passed to -addr is arbitrary. 
The bootnode command returns the following logs to the terminal, confirming that it is running:

```
enode://3063d1c9e1b824cfbb7c7b6abafa34faec6bb4e7e06941d218d760acdd7963b274278c5c3e63914bd6d1b58504c59ec5522c56f883baceb8538674b92da48a96@127.0.0.1:0?discport=30311
Note: you&#039;re using cmd/bootnode, a developer tool.
We recommend using a regular node as bootstrap node for production deployments.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># ..Modlishka..

Modlishka is an open-source penetration testing tool that acts as a man-in-the-middle proxy. It introduced a new technical approach to handling browser-based HTTP traffic flow, which allows it to transparently proxy multi-domain destination traffic, both TLS and non-TLS, over a single domain, without requiring the installation of any additional certificate on the client. This enables multiple practical use cases.

Modlishka was the first publicly released research tool, in 2019, to demonstrate a novel Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) technique capable of bypassing many common 2FA implementations ‚Äî with the goal of raising awareness and improving real-world defenses.

The project was created to highlight authentication flaws and is intended strictly for authorized research and professional security testing.


From a security perspective, Modlishka can currently be used to:
-	Support ethical phishing penetration tests with a transparent and automated reverse proxy component that has a universal 2FA ‚Äúbypass‚Äù support.
-  Wrap legacy websites with a TLS layer, confuse crawler bots and automated scanners, etc.


Modlishka was written as an attempt to overcome standard reverse proxy limitations and as a personal challenge to see what is possible with sufficient motivation and a bit of extra research time. 
The achieved results appeared to be very interesting and the tool was initially released and later updated with an aim to:
- Highlight currently used two-factor authentication ([2FA](https://blog.duszynski.eu/phishing-ng-bypassing-2fa-with-modlishka/)) scheme weaknesses, so adequate security solutions can be created and implemented by the industry.
- Support other projects that could benefit from a universal and transparent reverse proxy.
- Raise community awareness about modern phishing techniques and strategies and support penetration testers in their daily work.


Modlishka was primarily written for security-related tasks. Nevertheless, it can be helpful in other, non-security related, usage scenarios.

Features
--------

Key features of Modlishka include:

**General:**
-   Point-and-click HTTP and HTTPS reverse proxying of an arbitrary domain/s.
-   Full control of &quot;cross&quot; origin TLS traffic flow from your users browsers (without the requirement of installing any additional certificate on the client).
-   Easy and fast configuration through command line options and JSON configuration files.
-   Pattern based JavaScript payload injection.
-   Wrapping websites with an extra &quot;security&quot;: TLS wrapping, authentication, relevant security headers, etc. 
-   Stripping websites of all encryption and security headers (back to 90&#039;s MITM style). 
-   Stateless design. Can be scaled up easily to handle an arbitrary amount of traffic  - e.g. through a DNS load balancer.
-   Can be extended easily with your ideas through modular plugins.
-   Automatic test TLS certificate generation plugin for the proxy domain (requires a self-signed CA certificate)
-   Written in Go, so it works basically on all platforms and architectures: Windows, OSX, Linux, BSD supported...

**Security related:**
-  Support for majority of 2FA authentication schemes (out of the box).
-   Practical implementation of the &quot;[Client Domain Hooking](https://blog.duszynski.eu/client-domain-hooking-in-practice/)&quot; attack. Supported with a diagnostic plugin.
-  User credential harvesting (with context based on URL parameter passed identifiers).
-  Web panel plugin with a summary of automatically collected credentials and one-click user session impersonation module (proof-of-concept/beta).
-  No website templates (just point Modlishka to the target domain - in most cases, it will be handled automatically without any additional manual configuration).

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.

## Developing Terraform

This repository contains only Terraform core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine. Providers are implemented as plugins, and Terraform can automatically download providers that are published on [the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io). HashiCorp develops some providers, and others are developed by other organizations. For more information, refer to [Plugin development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Domain list community

This project manages a list of domains, to be used as geosites for routing purpose in Project V.

## Purpose of this project

This project is not opinionated. In other words, it does NOT endorse, claim or imply that a domain should be blocked or proxied. It can be used to generate routing rules on demand.

## Download links

## Usage example

Each file in the `data` directory can be used as a rule in this format: `geosite:filename`.

```json
&quot;routing&quot;: {
  &quot;domainStrategy&quot;: &quot;IPIfNonMatch&quot;,
  &quot;rules&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Reject&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-ads-all&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-porn&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Direct&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;domain:icloud.com&quot;,
        &quot;domain:icloud-content.com&quot;,
        &quot;domain:cdn-apple.com&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:cn&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:private&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-1&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-anticensorship&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-media&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-vpnservices&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-2&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-dev&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-3&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:geolocation-!cn&quot;
      ]
    }

## Generate `dlc.dat` manually

- Install `golang` and `git`
- Clone project code: `git clone https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community.git`
- Navigate to project root directory: `cd domain-list-community`
- Install project dependencies: `go mod download`
- Generate `dlc.dat` (without `datapath` option means to use domain lists in `data` directory of current working directory):
  - `go run ./`
  - `go run ./ --datapath=/path/to/your/custom/data/directory`

Run `go run ./ --help` for more usage information.

## Structure of data

All data are under `data` directory. Each file in the directory represents a sub-list of domains, named by the file name. File content is in the following format.

```
# comments
include:another-file
domain:google.com @attr1 @attr2
keyword:google
regexp:www\.google\.com$
full:www.google.com
```

**Syntax:**

&gt; The following types of rules are **NOT** fully compatible with the ones that defined by user in V2Ray config file. Do **Not** copy and paste directly.

* Comment begins with `#`. It may begin anywhere in the file. The content in the line after `#` is treated as comment and ignored in production.
* Inclusion begins with `include:`, followed by the file name of an existing file in the same directory.
* Subdomain begins with `domain:`, followed by a valid domain name. The prefix `domain:` may be omitted.
* Keyword begins with `keyword:`, followed by a string.
* Regular expression begins with `regexp:`, followed by a valid regular expression (per Golang&#039;s standard).
* Full domain begins with `full:`, followed by a complete and valid domain name.
* Domains (including `domain`, `keyword`, `regexp` and `full`) may have one or more attributes. Each attribute begins with `@` and followed by the name of the attribute.

&gt; **Note:** Adding new `regexp` and `keyword` rules is discouraged because it is easy to use them incorrectly, and proxy software cannot efficiently match these types of rules.

## How it works

The entire `data` directory will be built into an external `geosite` file for Project V. Each file in the directory represents a section in the generated file.

To generate a section:

1. Remove all the comments in the file.
2. Replace `include:` lines with the actual content of the file.
3. Omit all empty lines.
4. Generate each `domain:` line into a [sub-domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L21).
5. Generate each `keyword:` line into a [plain domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L17).
6. Generate each `regexp:` line into a [regex domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L19).
7. Generate each `full:` line into a [full domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L23).

## How to organize domains

### File name

Theoretically any string can be used as the name, as long as it is a valid file name. In practice, we prefer names for determinic group of domains, such as the owner (usually a company name) of the domains, e.g., &quot;google&quot;, &quot;netflix&quot;. Names with unclear scope are generally unrecommended, such as &quot;evil&quot;, or &quot;local&quot;.

### Attributes

Attribute is useful for sub-group of domains, especially for filtering purpose. For example, the list of `google` domains may contains its main domains, as well as domains that serve ads. The ads domains may be marked by attribute `@ads`, and can be used as `geosite:google@ads` in V2Ray routing.

# About

[Fyne](https://fyne.io) is an easy-to-use UI toolkit and app API written in Go.
It is designed to build applications that run on desktop and mobile devices with a
single codebase.

# Prerequisites

To develop apps using Fyne you will need Go version 1.17 or later, a C compiler and your system&#039;s development tools.
If you&#039;re not sure if that&#039;s all installed or you don&#039;t know how then check out our
[Getting Started](https://fyne.io/develop/) document.

Using the standard go tools you can install Fyne&#039;s core library using:

    go get fyne.io/fyne/v2@latest

After importing a new module, run the following command before compiling the code for the first time. Avoid running it before writing code that uses the module to prevent accidental removal of dependencies:

    go mod tidy

# Widget demo

To run a showcase of the features of Fyne execute the following:

    go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo@latest
    fyne_demo

And you should see something like this (after you click a few buttons):

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-dark.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Dark Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Or if you are using the light theme:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-light.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Light Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

And even running on a mobile device:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/widgets-mobile-light.png&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Demo Mobile Light Theme&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

# Getting Started

Fyne is designed to be really easy to code with.
If you have followed the prerequisite steps above then all you need is a
Go IDE (or a text editor).

Open a new file and you&#039;re ready to write your first app!

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/app&quot;
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/container&quot;
	&quot;fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget&quot;
)

func main() {
	a := app.New()
	w := a.NewWindow(&quot;Hello&quot;)

	hello := widget.NewLabel(&quot;Hello Fyne!&quot;)
	w.SetContent(container.NewVBox(
		hello,
		widget.NewButton(&quot;Hi!&quot;, func() {
			hello.SetText(&quot;Welcome :)&quot;)
		}),
	))

	w.ShowAndRun()
}
```

And you can run that simply as:

    go run main.go

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; The first compilation of Fyne on Windows _can_ take up to 10 minutes, depending on your hardware. Subsequent builds will be fast.

It should look like this:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;img/hello-light.png&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Hello Dark Theme&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;img/hello-dark.png&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;Fyne Hello Dark Theme&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Run in mobile simulation

There is a helpful mobile simulation mode that gives a hint of how your app would work on a mobile device:

    go run -tags mobile main.go

Another option is to use `fyne` command, see [Packaging for mobile](#packaging-for-mobile).

# Installing

Using `go install` will copy the executable into your go `bin` dir.
To install the application with icons etc into your operating system&#039;s standard
application location you can use the fyne utility and the &quot;install&quot; subcommand.

    go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne@latest
    fyne install

# Packaging for mobile

To run on a mobile device it is necessary to package up the application.
To do this we can use the fyne utility &quot;package&quot; subcommand.
You will need to add appropriate parameters as prompted, but the basic command is shown below.
Once packaged you can install using the platform development tools or the fyne &quot;install&quot; subcommand.

    fyne package -os android -appID my.domain.appname
    fyne install -os android

The built Android application can run either in a real device or an Android emulator.
However, building for iOS is slightly different.
If the &quot;-os&quot; argument is &quot;ios&quot;, it is build only for a real iOS device.
Specify &quot;-os&quot; to &quot;iossimulator&quot; allows the application be able to run in an iOS simulator:

    fyne package -os ios -appID my.domain.appname
    fyne package -os iossimulator -appID my.domain.appname

# Preparing a release

Using the fyne utility &quot;release&quot; subcommand you can package up your app for release
to app stores and market places. Make sure you have the standard build tools installed
and have followed the platform documentation for setting up accounts and signing.
Then you can execute something like the following, notice the `-os ios` parameter allows
building an iOS app from macOS computer. Other combinations work as well :)

    $ fyne release -os ios -certificate &quot;Apple Distribution&quot; -profile &quot;My App Distribution&quot; -appID &quot;com.example.myapp&quot;

The above command will create a &#039;.ipa&#039; file that can then be uploaded to the iOS App Store.

# Documentation

More documentation is available at the [Fyne developer website](https://developer.fyne.io/) or on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/fyne/v2?tab=doc).

# Examples

You can find many example applications in the [examples repository](https://github.com/fyne-io/examples/).
Alternatively a list of applications using fyne can be found at [our website](https://apps.fyne.io/).

# Shipping the Fyne Toolkit

All Fyne apps will work without pre-installed libraries, this is one reason the apps are so portable.
However, if looking to support Fyne in a bigger way on your operating system then you can install some utilities that help to make a more complete experience.

## Additional apps

It is recommended that you install the following additional apps:

| app           | go install                          | description                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fyne_settings | `fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_settings` | A GUI for managing your global Fyne settings like theme and scaling    |
| apps          | `github.com/fyne-io/apps`           | A graphical installer for the Fyne apps listed at https://apps.fyne.io |

These are optional applications but can help to create a more complete desktop experience.

## FyneDesk (Linux / BSD)

To go all the way with Fyne on your desktop / laptop computer you could install [FyneDesk](https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk) as well :)

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; There is no stable version -- :construction: planned for 2025. ([Read more](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/discussions/628))


## Announcements

[Stable Release &amp; 0.9.0 update](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/discussions/1293)

## About

FileBrowser Quantum provides an easy way to access and manage your files from the web. It has has a modern responsive interface that has many advanced features to manage users, access, sharing, and file preview and editing.

This version is called &quot;Quantum&quot; because it packs tons of advanced features into a tiny easy to run file. Unlike the majority of alternative options, FileBrowser Quantum is simple to install and easy to configure.

The goal for this repo is to become the best open-source self-hosted file browsing application that exists -- **all for free**. This repo will always be free and open-source.

Ready to try it out? See [Getting Started Wiki](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/wiki/Getting-Started).

## How its different

FileBrowser Quantum is a massive fork of the file browser open-source project with the following changes:

  1. ‚úÖ Multiple sources support
  2. ‚úÖ Login support for OIDC, password + 2FA, and proxy.
  3. ‚úÖ Beautiful, Responsive, and Customizable user interface.
  4. ‚úÖ Simplified configuration via `config.yaml` config file.
  5. ‚úÖ Ultra-efficient [indexing](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/wiki/Indexing) and real-time updates
     - Real-time search results as you type.
     - Real-time monitoring and updates in the UI.
     - Search supports file and folder sizes, along with various filters.
  6. ‚úÖ Better listing browsing
     - More file type previews, such as **office** and **video** file previews
     - Instantly switches view modes and sort order without reloading data.
     - Folder sizes are displayed.
     - Navigating remembers the last scroll position.
  7. ‚úÖ Highly configurable and customizable sharing options, incuding:
     - share expiration time
     - users who can access share (including anonymous)
     - styling and themes
     - file viewing, editing, and uploading permissions
  8. ‚úÖ Directory-level access control that can be scoped to user or group.
  8. ‚úÖ Developer API support
     - Ability to create long-lived API Tokens.
     - A helpful Swagger page is available at `/swagger` endpoint for API enabled users.

Notable features that this fork *does not* have (removed):

 - :construction: jobs are not supported yet.
 - ‚ùå shell commands are completely removed and will not be returned.


FileBrowser Quantum differs significantly from the original version. Many of these changes required a significant overhaul. Creating a fork was a necessary process to make the program better. There have been many growing pains, but a stable release is planned and coming soon.

## System Requirements

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Every file and directory in the source gets indexed (by default). This enables powerful features such as instant search, but large source filesystems can increase your system requirements. [See indexing wiki](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/wiki/Indexing) for more info.

 - **Memory**: depends on configured source complexity. See [how much RAM does it require?](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/discussions/787)
 - **GPU**: Not currently used (planned)

## The UI

The UI has a simple three-component navigation system:

  1. (Left) Multi-action button with slide-out panel.
  2. (Middle) The powerful search bar.
  3. (Right) The view change toggle.

All other functions are moved either into the action menu or pop-up menus.
If the action does not depend on context, it will exist in the slide-out
action panel. If the action is available based on context, it will show up as
a pop-up menu.

# What is SyncTV?
