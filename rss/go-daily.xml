# Wave Terminal

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm?ref=badge_shield)

Wave is an open-source terminal that combines traditional terminal features with graphical capabilities like file previews, web browsing, and AI assistance. It runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

Modern development involves constantly switching between terminals and browsers - checking documentation, previewing files, monitoring systems, and using AI tools. Wave brings these graphical tools directly into the terminal, letting you control them from the command line. This means you can stay in your terminal workflow while still having access to the visual interfaces you need.

![WaveTerm Screenshot](./assets/wave-screenshot.webp)

## Key Features

- Flexible drag &amp; drop interface to organize terminal blocks, editors, web browsers, and AI assistants
- Built-in editor for seamlessly editing remote files with syntax highlighting and modern editor features
- Rich file preview system for remote files (markdown, images, video, PDFs, CSVs, directories)
- Quick full-screen toggle for any block - expand terminals, editors, and previews for better visibility, then instantly return to multi-block view
- Wave AI - Context-aware terminal assistant that reads your terminal output, analyzes widgets, and performs file operations
- AI chat widget with support for multiple models (OpenAI, Claude, Azure, Perplexity, Ollama)
- Command Blocks for isolating and monitoring individual commands with auto-close options
- One-click remote connections with full terminal and file system access
- Secure secret storage using native system backends - store API keys and credentials locally, access them across SSH sessions
- Rich customization including tab themes, terminal styles, and background images
- Powerful `wsh` command system for managing your workspace from the CLI and sharing data between terminal sessions
- Connected file management with `wsh file` - seamlessly copy and sync files between local, remote SSH hosts, Wave filesystem, and S3

## Wave AI

Wave AI is your context-aware terminal assistant with access to your workspace:

- **Terminal Context**: Reads terminal output and scrollback for debugging and analysis
- **File Operations**: Read, write, and edit files with automatic backups and user approval
- **CLI Integration**: Use `wsh ai` to pipe output or attach files directly from the command line
- **Free Beta**: Included AI credits while we refine the experience
- **Coming Soon**: Command execution (with approval), local model support, and alternate AI providers (BYOK)

- [Related Projects](#related-projects)

## Quick Start

Ready to get your first agentic workflow running? Follow our step-by-step [Quick Start Guide](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) to install the extension, add a sample workflow, and see it in action.

## Overview

Learn about the concepts behind agentic workflows, explore available workflow types, and understand how AI can automate your repository tasks. See [How It Works](https://github.github.io/gh-aw/introduction/how-they-work/).

## How It Works

GitHub Agentic Workflows transforms natural language markdown files into GitHub Actions that are executed by AI agents. Here&#039;s an example:

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule: daily
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: &quot;[team-status] &quot;
    labels: [report, daily-status]
    close-older-issues: true
---

## Daily Issues Report

Create an upbeat daily status report for the team as a GitHub issue.
```

The `gh aw` cli converts this into a GitHub Actions Workflow (.yml) that runs an AI agent (Copilot, Claude, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment on a schedule or manually.

The AI agent reads your repository context, analyzes issues, generates visualizations, and creates reports - all defined in natural language rather than complex code.

## Safety

Security is foundational to GitHub Agentic Workflows. Workflows run with read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized `safe-outputs`. The system implements multiple layers of protection including sandboxed execution, input sanitization, network isolation, supply chain security (SHA-pinned dependencies), tool allow-listing, and compile-time validation. Access can be gated to team members only, with human approval gates for critical operations, ensuring AI agents operate safely within controlled boundaries. See the [Security Architecture](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) for comprehensive details on threat modeling, implementation guidelines, and best practices.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Using agentic workflows in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

![OAuth2 Proxy](docs/static/img/logos/OAuth2_Proxy_horizontal.svg)

OAuth2 Proxy is a flexible, open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. It provides a simple and secure way to protect your web applications with OAuth2 / OIDC authentication. As a reverse proxy, it intercepts requests to your application and redirects users to an OAuth2 provider for authentication. As a middleware, it can be seamlessly integrated into your existing infrastructure to handle authentication for multiple applications.

OAuth2 Proxy supports a lot of OAuth2 as well as OIDC providers. Either through a generic OIDC client or a specific implementation for Google, Microsoft Entra ID, GitHub, login.gov and others. Through specialised provider implementations oauth2-proxy can extract more details about the user like preferred usernames and groups. Those details can then be forwarded as HTTP headers to your upstream applications.

![Simplified Architecture](docs/static/img/simplified-architecture.svg)

## Get Started

OAuth2 Proxy&#039;s [Installation Docs](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/installation) cover how to install and configure your setup. Additionally you can take a further look at the [example setup files](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/tree/master/contrib/local-environment).

## Releases

### Binaries
We publish oauth2-proxy as compiled binaries on GitHub for all major architectures as well as more exotic ones like `ppc64le` as well as `s390x`.

Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/latest).

### Images

From `v7.6.0` and up the base image has been changed from Alpine to [GoogleContainerTools/distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).
This image comes with even fewer installed dependencies and thus should improve security. The image therefore is also slightly smaller than Alpine.
For debugging purposes (and those who really need it. e.g. `armv6`) we still provide images based on Alpine. The tags of these images are suffixed with `-alpine`.

Since 2023-11-18 we build nightly images directly from the `master` branch and provide them at `quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy-nightly`.
These images are considered unstable and therefore should **NOT** be used for production purposes unless you know what you&#039;re doing.

[![GoDoc Widget]][GoDoc]

`chi` is a lightweight, idiomatic and composable router for building Go HTTP services. It&#039;s
especially good at helping you write large REST API services that are kept maintainable as your
project grows and changes. `chi` is built on the new `context` package introduced in Go 1.7 to
handle signaling, cancelation and request-scoped values across a handler chain.

The focus of the project has been to seek out an elegant and comfortable design for writing
REST API servers, written during the development of the Pressly API service that powers our
public API service, which in turn powers all of our client-side applications.

The key considerations of chi&#039;s design are: project structure, maintainability, standard http
handlers (stdlib-only), developer productivity, and deconstructing a large system into many small
parts. The core router `github.com/go-chi/chi` is quite small (less than 1000 LOC), but we&#039;ve also
included some useful/optional subpackages: [middleware](/middleware), [render](https://github.com/go-chi/render)
and [docgen](https://github.com/go-chi/docgen). We hope you enjoy it too!

## Install

```sh
go get -u github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
```


## Features

* **Lightweight** - cloc&#039;d in ~1000 LOC for the chi router
* **Fast** - yes, see [benchmarks](#benchmarks)
* **100% compatible with net/http** - use any http or middleware pkg in the ecosystem that is also compatible with `net/http`
* **Designed for modular/composable APIs** - middlewares, inline middlewares, route groups and sub-router mounting
* **Context control** - built on new `context` package, providing value chaining, cancellations and timeouts
* **Robust** - in production at Pressly, Cloudflare, Heroku, 99Designs, and many others (see [discussion](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/issues/91))
* **Doc generation** - `docgen` auto-generates routing documentation from your source to JSON or Markdown
* **Go.mod support** - as of v5, go.mod support (see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))
* **No external dependencies** - plain ol&#039; Go stdlib + net/http


## Examples

See [_examples/](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/_examples/) for a variety of examples.


**As easy as:**

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;net/http&quot;

	&quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5&quot;
	&quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware&quot;
)

func main() {
	r := chi.NewRouter()
	r.Use(middleware.Logger)
	r.Get(&quot;/&quot;, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Write([]byte(&quot;welcome&quot;))
	})
	http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:3000&quot;, r)
}
```

**REST Preview:**

Here is a little preview of what routing looks like with chi. Also take a look at the generated routing docs
in JSON ([routes.json](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/_examples/rest/routes.json)) and in
Markdown ([routes.md](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/_examples/rest/routes.md)).

I highly recommend reading the source of the [examples](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/_examples/) listed
above, they will show you all the features of chi and serve as a good form of documentation.

```go
import (
  //...
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5&quot;
  &quot;github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware&quot;
)

func main() {
  r := chi.NewRouter()

  // A good base middleware stack
  r.Use(middleware.RequestID)
  r.Use(middleware.RealIP)
  r.Use(middleware.Logger)
  r.Use(middleware.Recoverer)

  // Set a timeout value on the request context (ctx), that will signal
  // through ctx.Done() that the request has timed out and further
  // processing should be stopped.
  r.Use(middleware.Timeout(60 * time.Second))

  r.Get(&quot;/&quot;, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte(&quot;hi&quot;))
  })

  // RESTy routes for &quot;articles&quot; resource
  r.Route(&quot;/articles&quot;, func(r chi.Router) {
    r.With(paginate).Get(&quot;/&quot;, listArticles)                           // GET /articles
    r.With(paginate).Get(&quot;/{month}-{day}-{year}&quot;, listArticlesByDate) // GET /articles/01-16-2017

    r.Post(&quot;/&quot;, createArticle)                                        // POST /articles
    r.Get(&quot;/search&quot;, searchArticles)                                  // GET /articles/search

    // Regexp url parameters:
    r.Get(&quot;/{articleSlug:[a-z-]+}&quot;, getArticleBySlug)                // GET /articles/home-is-toronto

    // Subrouters:
    r.Route(&quot;/{articleID}&quot;, func(r chi.Router) {
      r.Use(ArticleCtx)
      r.Get(&quot;/&quot;, getArticle)                                          // GET /articles/123
      r.Put(&quot;/&quot;, updateArticle)                                       // PUT /articles/123
      r.Delete(&quot;/&quot;, deleteArticle)                                    // DELETE /articles/123
    })
  })

  // Mount the admin sub-router
  r.Mount(&quot;/admin&quot;, adminRouter())

  http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:3333&quot;, r)
}

func ArticleCtx(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    articleID := chi.URLParam(r, &quot;articleID&quot;)
    article, err := dbGetArticle(articleID)
    if err != nil {
      http.Error(w, http.StatusText(404), 404)
      return
    }
    ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), &quot;article&quot;, article)
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
  })
}

func getArticle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  ctx := r.Context()
  article, ok := ctx.Value(&quot;article&quot;).(*Article)
  if !ok {
    http.Error(w, http.StatusText(422), 422)
    return
  }
  w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;title:%s&quot;, article.Title)))
}

// A completely separate router for administrator routes
func adminRouter() http.Handler {
  r := chi.NewRouter()
  r.Use(AdminOnly)
  r.Get(&quot;/&quot;, adminIndex)
  r.Get(&quot;/accounts&quot;, adminListAccounts)
  return r
}

func AdminOnly(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    ctx := r.Context()
    perm, ok := ctx.Value(&quot;acl.permission&quot;).(YourPermissionType)
    if !ok || !perm.IsAdmin() {
      http.Error(w, http.StatusText(403), 403)
      return
    }
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
  })
}
```


## Router interface

chi&#039;s router is based on a kind of [Patricia Radix trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree).
The router is fully compatible with `net/http`.

Built on top of the tree is the `Router` interface:

```go
// Router consisting of the core routing methods used by chi&#039;s Mux,
// using only the standard net/http.
type Router interface {
	http.Handler
	Routes

	// Use appends one or more middlewares onto the Router stack.
	Use(middlewares ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler)

	// With adds inline middlewares for an endpoint handler.
	With(middlewares ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler) Router

	// Group adds a new inline-Router along the current routing
	// path, with a fresh middleware stack for the inline-Router.
	Group(fn func(r Router)) Router

	// Route mounts a sub-Router along a `pattern` string.
	Route(pattern string, fn func(r Router)) Router

	// Mount attaches another http.Handler along ./pattern/*
	Mount(pattern string, h http.Handler)

	// Handle and HandleFunc adds routes for `pattern` that matches
	// all HTTP methods.
	Handle(pattern string, h http.Handler)
	HandleFunc(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// Method and MethodFunc adds routes for `pattern` that matches
	// the `method` HTTP method.
	Method(method, pattern string, h http.Handler)
	MethodFunc(method, pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// HTTP-method routing along `pattern`
	Connect(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Delete(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Get(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Head(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Options(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Patch(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Post(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Put(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Trace(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// NotFound defines a handler to respond whenever a route could
	// not be found.
	NotFound(h http.HandlerFunc)

	// MethodNotAllowed defines a handler to respond whenever a method is
	// not allowed.
	MethodNotAllowed(h http.HandlerFunc)
}

// Routes interface adds two methods for router traversal, which is also
// used by the github.com/go-chi/docgen package to generate documentation for Routers.
type Routes interface {
	// Routes returns the routing tree in an easily traversable structure.
	Routes() []Route

	// Middlewares returns the list of middlewares in use by the router.
	Middlewares() Middlewares

	// Match searches the routing tree for a handler that matches
	// the method/path - similar to routing a http request, but without
	// executing the handler thereafter.
	Match(rctx *Context, method, path string) bool
}
```

Each routing method accepts a URL `pattern` and chain of `handlers`. The URL pattern
supports named params (ie. `/users/{userID}`) and wildcards (ie. `/admin/*`). URL parameters
can be fetched at runtime by calling `chi.URLParam(r, &quot;userID&quot;)` for named parameters
and `chi.URLParam(r, &quot;*&quot;)` for a wildcard parameter.


### Middleware handlers

chi&#039;s middlewares are just stdlib net/http middleware handlers. There is nothing special
about them, which means the router and all the tooling is designed to be compatible and
friendly with any middleware in the community. This offers much better extensibility and reuse
of packages and is at the heart of chi&#039;s purpose.

Here is an example of a standard net/http middleware where we assign a context key `&quot;user&quot;`
the value of `&quot;123&quot;`. This middleware sets a hypothetical user identifier on the request
context and calls the next handler in the chain.

```go
// HTTP middleware setting a value on the request context
func MyMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // create new context from `r` request context, and assign key `&quot;user&quot;`
    // to value of `&quot;123&quot;`
    ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), &quot;user&quot;, &quot;123&quot;)

    // call the next handler in the chain, passing the response writer and
    // the updated request object with the new context value.
    //
    // note: context.Context values are nested, so any previously set
    // values will be accessible as well, and the new `&quot;user&quot;` key
    // will be accessible from this point forward.
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
  })
}
```


### Request handlers

chi uses standard net/http request handlers. This little snippet is an example of a http.Handler
func that reads a user identifier from the request context - hypothetically, identifying
the user sending an authenticated request, validated+set by a previous middleware handler.

```go
// HTTP handler accessing data from the request context.
func MyRequestHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // here we read from the request context and fetch out `&quot;user&quot;` key set in
  // the MyMiddleware example above.
  user := r.Context().Value(&quot;user&quot;).(string)

  // respond to the client
  w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;hi %s&quot;, user)))
}
```


### URL parameters

chi&#039;s router parses and stores URL parameters right onto the request context. Here is
an example of how to access URL params in your net/http handlers. And of course, middlewares
are able to access the same information.

```go
// HTTP handler accessing the url routing parameters.
func MyRequestHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // fetch the url parameter `&quot;userID&quot;` from the request of a matching
  // routing pattern. An example routing pattern could be: /users/{userID}
  userID := chi.URLParam(r, &quot;userID&quot;)

  // fetch `&quot;key&quot;` from the request context
  ctx := r.Context()
  key := ctx.Value(&quot;key&quot;).(string)

  // respond to the client
  w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;hi %v, %v&quot;, userID, key)))
}
```


## Middlewares

chi comes equipped with an optional `middleware` package, providing a suite of standard
`net/http` middlewares. Please note, any middleware in the ecosystem that is also compatible
with `net/http` can be used with chi&#039;s mux.

# Loki: like Prometheus, but for logs.

Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate.
It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

Compared to other log aggregation systems, Loki:

- does not do full text indexing on logs. By storing compressed, unstructured logs and only indexing metadata, Loki is simpler to operate and cheaper to run.
- indexes and groups log streams using the same labels you’re already using with Prometheus, enabling you to seamlessly switch between metrics and logs using the same labels that you’re already using with Prometheus.
- is an especially good fit for storing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Pod logs. Metadata such as Pod labels is automatically scraped and indexed.
- has native support in Grafana (needs Grafana v6.0).

A Loki-based logging stack consists of 3 components:

- [Alloy](https://github.com/grafana/alloy) is agent, responsible for gathering logs and sending them to Loki.
- [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) is the main service, responsible for storing logs and processing queries.
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) for querying and displaying the logs.

**Note that Alloy replaced Promtail in the stack, because Promtail is considered to be feature complete, and future development for logs collection will be in [Grafana Alloy](https://github.com/grafana/alloy).**

Loki is like Prometheus, but for logs: we prefer a multidimensional label-based approach to indexing, and want a single-binary, easy to operate system with no dependencies.
Loki differs from Prometheus by focusing on logs instead of metrics, and delivering logs via push, instead of pull.

### Building from source

Loki can be run in a single host, no-dependencies mode using the following commands.

You need an up-to-date version of [Go](https://go.dev/), we recommend using the version found in our [Makefile](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/Makefile)

```bash
# Checkout source code
$ git clone https://github.com/grafana/loki
$ cd loki

# Build binary
$ go build ./cmd/loki

# Run executable
$ ./loki -config.file=./cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
```

Alternatively, on Unix systems you can use `make` to build the binary, which adds additional arguments to the `go build` command.

```bash
# Build binary
$ make loki

# Run executable
$ ./cmd/loki/loki -config.file=./cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
```

To build Promtail on non-Linux platforms, use the following command:

```bash
$ go build ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

On Linux, Promtail requires the systemd headers to be installed if
Journal support is enabled.
To enable Journal support the go build tag flag `promtail_journal_enabled` should be passed

With Journal support on Ubuntu, run with the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt install -y libsystemd-dev
$ go build --tags=promtail_journal_enabled ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

With Journal support on CentOS, run with the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo yum install -y systemd-devel
$ go build --tags=promtail_journal_enabled ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

Otherwise, to build Promtail without Journal support, run `go build`
with CGO disabled:

```bash
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./clients/cmd/promtail
```

## What is it?

Glow is a terminal based markdown reader designed from the ground up to bring
out the beauty—and power—of the CLI.

Use it to discover markdown files, read documentation directly on the command
line. Glow will find local markdown files in subdirectories or a local
Git repository.

## Installation

### Package Manager

```bash
# macOS or Linux
brew install glow
```

```bash
# macOS (with MacPorts)
sudo port install glow
```

```bash
# Arch Linux (btw)
pacman -S glow
```

```bash
# Void Linux
xbps-install -S glow
```

```bash
# Nix shell
nix-shell -p glow --command glow
```

```bash
# FreeBSD
pkg install glow
```

```bash
# Solus
eopkg install glow
```

```bash
# Windows (with Chocolatey, Scoop, or Winget)
choco install glow
scoop install glow
winget install charmbracelet.glow
```

```bash
# Android (with termux)
pkg install glow
```

```bash
# Ubuntu (Snapcraft)
sudo snap install glow
```

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install glow
```

```bash
# Fedora/RHEL
echo &#039;[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key&#039; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install glow
```

Or download a binary from the [releases][releases] page. MacOS, Linux, Windows,
FreeBSD and OpenBSD binaries are available, as well as Debian, RPM, and Alpine
packages. ARM builds are also available for macOS, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

### Go

Or just install it with `go`:

```bash
go install github.com/charmbracelet/glow/v2@latest
```

### Build (requires Go 1.21+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow.git
cd glow
go build
```

[releases]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow/releases

## The TUI

Simply run `glow` without arguments to start the textual user interface and
browse local. Glow will find local markdown files in the
current directory and below or, if you’re in a Git repository, Glow will search
the repo.

Markdown files can be read with Glow&#039;s high-performance pager. Most of the
keystrokes you know from `less` are the same, but you can press `?` to list
the hotkeys.

## The CLI

In addition to a TUI, Glow has a CLI for working with Markdown. To format a
document use a markdown source as the primary argument:

```bash
# Read from file
glow README.md

# Read from stdin
echo &quot;[Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)&quot; | glow -

# Fetch README from GitHub / GitLab
glow github.com/charmbracelet/glow

# Fetch markdown from HTTP
glow https://host.tld/file.md
```

### Word Wrapping

The `-w` flag lets you set a maximum width at which the output will be wrapped:

```bash
glow -w 60
```

### Paging

CLI output can be displayed in your preferred pager with the `-p` flag. This defaults
to the ANSI-aware `less -r` if `$PAGER` is not explicitly set.

### Styles

You can choose a style with the `-s` flag. When no flag is provided `glow` tries
to detect your terminal&#039;s current background color and automatically picks
either the `dark` or the `light` style for you.

```bash
glow -s [dark|light]
```

Alternatively you can also supply a custom JSON stylesheet:

```bash
glow -s mystyle.json
```

For additional usage details see:

```bash
glow --help
```

Check out the [Glamour Style Section](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour/blob/master/styles/gallery/README.md)
to find more styles. Or [make your own](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour/tree/master/styles)!

## The Config File

If you find yourself supplying the same flags to `glow` all the time, it&#039;s
probably a good idea to create a config file. Run `glow config`, which will open
it in your favorite $EDITOR. Alternatively you can manually put a file named
`glow.yml` in the default config path of you platform. If you&#039;re not sure where
that is, please refer to `glow --help`.

Here&#039;s an example config:

```yaml
# style name or JSON path (default &quot;auto&quot;)
style: &quot;light&quot;
# mouse wheel support (TUI-mode only)
mouse: true
# use pager to display markdown
pager: true
# at which column should we word wrap?
width: 80
# show all files, including hidden and ignored.
all: false
# show line numbers (TUI-mode only)
showLineNumbers: false
# preserve newlines in the output
preserveNewLines: false
```

## Key Features

- **[Distributed Transactions](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/distributed-transactions-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB uses a two-phase commit protocol to ensure ACID compliance, providing strong consistency. Transactions span multiple nodes, and TiDB&#039;s distributed nature ensures data correctness even in the presence of network partitions or node failures.

- **[Horizontal and Vertical Scalability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/scale-tidb-using-tiup?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes or vertically by increasing resources of existing nodes, all without downtime. TiDB&#039;s architecture separates computing from storage, enabling you to adjust both independently as needed for flexibility and growth.

- **[High Availability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/high-availability-with-multi-az?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Built-in Raft consensus protocol ensures reliability and automated failover. Data is stored in multiple replicas, and transactions are committed only after writing to the majority of replicas, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability, even if some replicas fail. Geographic placement of replicas can be configured for different disaster tolerance levels.

- **[Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP)](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/htap-demystified-defining-modern-data-architecture-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB provides two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. The TiDB Server coordinates query execution across both TiKV and TiFlash to optimize performance.

- **[Cloud-Native](https://www.pingcap.com/cloud-native?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be deployed in public clouds, on-premises, or natively in Kubernetes. [TiDB Operator](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) helps manage TiDB on Kubernetes, automating cluster operations, while [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) provides a fully-managed service for easy and economical deployment, allowing users to set up clusters with just a few clicks.

- **[MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/mysql-compatibility?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB is compatible with MySQL 8.0, allowing you to use familiar protocols, frameworks and tools. You can migrate applications to TiDB without changing any code, or with minimal modifications. Additionally, TiDB provides a suite of [data migration tools](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/ecosystem-tool-user-guide?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) to help easily migrate application data into TiDB.

- **[Open Source Commitment](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/open-source-is-in-our-dna-reaffirming-tidb-commitment?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Open source is at the core of TiDB&#039;s identity. All source code is available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license, including enterprise-grade features. TiDB is built with the belief that open source enables transparency, innovation, and collaboration. We actively encourage contributions from the community to help build a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem, reaffirming our commitment to open development and accessibility for everyone.

✨ **`samber/lo` is a Lodash-style Go library based on Go 1.18+ Generics.**

A utility library based on Go 1.18+ generics that makes it easier to work with slices, maps, strings, channels, and functions. It provides dozens of handy methods to simplify common coding tasks and improve code readability. It may look like [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) in some aspects.

5 to 10 helpers may overlap with those from the Go standard library, in packages `slices` and `maps`. I feel this library is legitimate and offers many more valuable abstractions.

**See also:**

- [samber/ro](https://github.com/samber/ro): Reactive Programming for Go: declarative and composable API for event-driven applications
- [samber/do](https://github.com/samber/do): A dependency injection toolkit based on Go 1.18+ Generics
- [samber/mo](https://github.com/samber/mo): Monads based on Go 1.18+ Generics (Option, Result, Either...)

What makes it different from **samber/ro**?
- lo: synchronous helpers across finite sequences (maps, slices...)
- ro: processing of infinite data streams for event-driven scenarios

	I’m going all-in on open-source for the coming months.
	&lt;br&gt;
	Help sustain development: Become an &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/sponsors/samber&quot;&gt;individual sponsor&lt;/a&gt; or join as a &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hey@samuel-berthe.fr&quot;&gt;corporate sponsor&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

----

**Why this name?**

I wanted a **short name**, similar to &quot;Lodash&quot;, and no Go package uses this name.

![lo](docs/static/img/logo-full.png)

## 🚀 Install

```sh
go get github.com/samber/lo@v1
```

This library is v1 and follows SemVer strictly.

No breaking changes will be made to exported APIs before v2.0.0.

This library has no dependencies outside the Go standard library.

## 💡 Usage

You can import `lo` using:

```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;
    lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;
    lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;
    loi &quot;github.com/samber/lo/it&quot;
)
```

Then use one of the helpers below:

```go
names := lo.Uniq([]string{&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Samuel&quot;})
// []string{&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;John&quot;}
```

### Tips for lazy developers

I cannot recommend it, but in case you are too lazy for repeating `lo.` everywhere, you can import the entire library into the namespace.

```go
import (
    . &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;
)
```

I take no responsibility for this junk. 😁 💩

Constraints:

- Clonable

### Filter

Iterates over a collection and returns a slice of all the elements the predicate function returns `true` for.

```go
even := lo.Filter([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int, index int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0
})
// []int{2, 4}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/Apjg3WeSi7K)]

Mutable: like `lo.Filter()`, but the slice is updated in place.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
newList := lom.Filter(list, func(x int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0
})

list
// []int{2, 4, 3, 4}

newList
// []int{2, 4}
```

### Map

Manipulates a slice of one type and transforms it into a slice of another type:

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, index int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)
})
// []string{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/OkPcYAhBo0D)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.Map()`, but the transform function is called in a goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, _ int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)
})
// []string{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/sCJaB3quRMC)]

Mutable: like `lo.Map()`, but the slice is updated in place.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
lom.Map(list, func(x int) int {
    return x*2
})
// []int{2, 4, 6, 8}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/0jY3Z0B7O_5)]

### UniqMap

Manipulates a slice and transforms it to a slice of another type with unique values.

```go
type User struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
users := []User{{Name: &quot;Alex&quot;, Age: 10}, {Name: &quot;Alex&quot;, Age: 12}, {Name: &quot;Bob&quot;, Age: 11}, {Name: &quot;Alice&quot;, Age: 20}}

names := lo.UniqMap(users, func(u User, index int) string {
    return u.Name
})
// []string{&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/fygzLBhvUdB)]

### FilterMap

Returns a slice obtained after both filtering and mapping using the given callback function.

The callback function should return two values: the result of the mapping operation and whether the result element should be included or not.

```go
matching := lo.FilterMap([]string{&quot;cpu&quot;, &quot;gpu&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;keyboard&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) (string, bool) {
    if strings.HasSuffix(x, &quot;pu&quot;) {
        return &quot;xpu&quot;, true
    }
    return &quot;&quot;, false
})
// []string{&quot;xpu&quot;, &quot;xpu&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/-AuYXfy7opz)]

### FlatMap

Manipulates a slice and transforms and flattens it to a slice of another type. The transform function can either return a slice or a `nil`, and in the `nil` case no value is added to the final slice.

```go
lo.FlatMap([]int64{0, 1, 2}, func(x int64, _ int) []string {
    return []string{
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
    }
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/YSoYmQTA8-U)]

### Reduce

Reduces a collection to a single value. The value is calculated by accumulating the result of running each element in the collection through an accumulator function. Each successive invocation is supplied with the return value returned by the previous call.

```go
sum := lo.Reduce([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(agg int, item int, _ int) int {
    return agg + item
}, 0)
// 10
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/R4UHXZNaaUG)]

### ReduceRight

Like `lo.Reduce` except that it iterates over elements of collection from right to left.

```go
result := lo.ReduceRight([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}, func(agg []int, item []int, _ int) []int {
    return append(agg, item...)
}, []int{})
// []int{4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/Fq3W70l7wXF)]

### ForEach

Iterates over elements of a collection and invokes the function over each element.

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.ForEach([]string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints &quot;hello\nworld\n&quot;
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/oofyiUPRf8t)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.ForEach()`, but the callback is called as a goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.ForEach([]string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints &quot;hello\nworld\n&quot; or &quot;world\nhello\n&quot;
```

### ForEachWhile

Iterates over collection elements and invokes iteratee for each element collection return value decide to continue or break, like do while().

```go
list := []int64{1, 2, -42, 4}

lo.ForEachWhile(list, func(x int64, _ int) bool {
	if x &lt; 0 {
		return false
	}
	fmt.Println(x)
	return true
})
// 1
// 2
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/QnLGt35tnow)]

### Times

Times invokes the iteratee n times, returning a slice of the results of each invocation. The iteratee is invoked with index as argument.

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/vgQj3Glr6lT)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.Times()`, but callback is called in goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

### Uniq

Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice.

```go
uniqValues := lo.Uniq([]int{1, 2, 2, 1})
// []int{1, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/DTzbeXZ6iEN)]

### UniqBy

Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice. It accepts `iteratee` which is invoked for each element in the slice to generate the criterion by which uniqueness is computed.

```go
uniqValues := lo.UniqBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// []int{0, 1, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/g42Z3QSb53u)]

### GroupBy

Returns an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

groups := lo.GroupBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 3}, 1: []int{1, 4}, 2: []int{2, 5}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/XnQBd_v6brd)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.GroupBy()`, but callback is called in goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.GroupBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 3}, 1: []int{1, 4}, 2: []int{2, 5}}
```

### GroupByMap

Returns an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

groups := lo.GroupByMap([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) (int, int) {
    return i%3, i*2
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 6}, 1: []int{2, 8}, 2: []int{4, 10}}
```

### Chunk

Returns a slice of elements split into groups of length size. If the slice can&#039;t be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.

```go
lo.Chunk([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2)
// [][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}

lo.Chunk([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2)
// [][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6}}

lo.Chunk([]int{}, 2)
// [][]int{}

lo.Chunk([]int{0}, 2)
// [][]int{{0}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/kEMkFbdu85g)]

### Window

Creates a slice of sliding windows of a given size. Each window shares size-1 elements with the previous one. This is equivalent to `Sliding(collection, size, 1)`.

```go
lo.Window([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 3)
// [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}}

lo.Window([]float64{20, 22, 21, 23, 24}, 3)
// [][]float64{{20, 22, 21}, {22, 21, 23}, {21, 23, 24}}
```

### Sliding

Creates a slice of sliding windows of a given size with a given step. If step is equal to size, windows have no common elements (similar to Chunk). If step is less than size, windows share common elements.

```go
// Windows with shared elements (step &lt; size)
lo.Sliding([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 3, 1)
// [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}, {4, 5, 6}}

// Windows with no shared elements (step == size, like Chunk)
lo.Sliding([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 3, 3)
// [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}

// Step &gt; size (skipping elements)
lo.Sliding([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, 2, 3)
// [][]int{{1, 2}, {4, 5}, {7, 8}}
```

### PartitionBy

Returns a slice of elements split into groups. The order of grouped values is determined by the order they occur in collection. The grouping is generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

partitions := lo.PartitionBy([]int{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(x int) string {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        return &quot;negative&quot;
    } else if x%2 == 0 {
        return &quot;even&quot;
    }
    return &quot;odd&quot;
})
// [][]int{{-2, -1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 5}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/NfQ_nGjkgXW)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.PartitionBy()`, but callback is called in goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

partitions := lop.PartitionBy([]int{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(x int) string {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        return &quot;negative&quot;
    } else if x%2 == 0 {
        return &quot;even&quot;
    }
    return &quot;odd&quot;
})
// [][]int{{-2, -1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 5}}
```

### Flatten

Returns a slice a single level deep.

```go
flat := lo.Flatten([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 5}})
// []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/rbp9ORaMpjw)]

### Concat

Returns a new slice containing all the elements in collections. Concat conserves the order of the elements.

```go
slice :

## Elevator Pitch

Rant time: You&#039;ve heard it before, git is _powerful_, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? _Are you kidding me?_ To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can&#039;t be split down any further but contains code you don&#039;t want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file _by hand_? _Are you KIDDING me?!_ Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren&#039;t even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? _YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!_

If you&#039;re a mere mortal like me and you&#039;re tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it&#039;s a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.

## Features

### Stage individual lines

Press space on the selected line to stage it, or press `v` to start selecting a range of lines. You can also press `a` to select the entirety of the current hunk.

![stage_lines](../assets/demo/stage_lines-compressed.gif)

### Interactive Rebase

Press `i` to start an interactive rebase. Then squash (`s`), fixup (`f`), drop (`d`), edit (`e`), move up (`ctrl+k`) or move down (`ctrl+j`) any of TODO commits, before continuing the rebase by bringing up the rebase options menu with `m` and then selecting `continue`.

You can also perform any these actions as a once-off (e.g. pressing `s` on a commit to squash it) without explicitly starting a rebase.

This demo also uses shift+down to select a range of commits to move and fixup.

![interactive_rebase](../assets/demo/interactive_rebase-compressed.gif)

### Cherry-pick

Press `shift+c` on a commit to copy it and press `shift+v` to paste (cherry-pick) it.

![cherry_pick](../assets/demo/cherry_pick-compressed.gif)

### Bisect

Press `b` in the commits view to mark a commit as good/bad in order to begin a git bisect.

![bisect](../assets/demo/bisect-compressed.gif)

### Nuke the working tree

For when you really want to just get rid of anything that shows up when you run `git status` (and yes that includes dirty submodules) [kidpix style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4E2B_k2Bss), press `shift+d` to bring up the reset options menu and then select the &#039;nuke&#039; option.

![Nuke working tree](../assets/demo/nuke_working_tree-compressed.gif)

### Amend an old commit

Pressing `shift+a` on any commit will amend that commit with the currently staged changes (running an interactive rebase in the background).

Kueue is a set of APIs and controller for [job](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/workload)
[queueing](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts#queueing). It is a job-level manager that decides when
a job should be [admitted](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts#admission) to start (as in pods can be
created) and when it should stop (as in active pods should be deleted).

Read the [overview](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/overview/) and watch the Kueue-related [talks &amp; presentations](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/talks_and_presentations/) to learn more.

## Features overview

- **Job management:** Support job queueing based on [priorities](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/workload/#priority) with different [strategies](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#queueing-strategy): `StrictFIFO` and `BestEffortFIFO`.
- **Advanced Resource management:** Comprising: [resource flavor fungibility](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#flavorfungibility), [Fair Sharing](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/preemption/#fair-sharing), [cohorts](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#cohort) and [preemption](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#preemption) with a variety of policies between different tenants.
- **Integrations:** Built-in support for popular jobs, e.g. [BatchJob](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/jobs/), [Kubeflow training jobs](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/kubeflow/), [RayJob](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/rayjobs/), [RayCluster](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/rayclusters/), [JobSet](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/jobsets/),  [plain Pod and Pod Groups](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/plain_pods/).
- **System insight:** Build-in [prometheus metrics](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/metrics/) to help monitor the state of the system, and on-demand visibility endpoint for [monitoring of pending workloads](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/manage/monitor_pending_workloads/pending_workloads_on_demand/).
- **AdmissionChecks:** A mechanism for internal or external components to influence whether a workload can be [admitted](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/admission_check/).
- **Advanced autoscaling support:** Integration with cluster-autoscaler&#039;s [provisioningRequest](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/admission_check/provisioning_request/#job-using-a-provisioningrequest) via admissionChecks.
- **All-or-nothing with ready Pods:** A timeout-based implementation of [All-or-nothing scheduling](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/manage/setup_wait_for_pods_ready/).
- **Partial admission and dynamic reclaim:** mechanisms to run a job with [reduced parallelism](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/jobs/#partial-admission), based on available quota, and to [release](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/workload/#dynamic-reclaim) the quota the pods complete..
- **Mixing training and inference**: Simultaneous management of batch workloads along with serving workloads (such as [Deployments](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/deployment/) or [StatefulSets](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/statefulset/))
- **Multi-cluster job dispatching:** called [MultiKueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/multikueue/), allows to search for capacity and off-load the main cluster.
- **Topology-Aware Scheduling**: Allows to optimize the Pod-to-Pod communication throughput by [scheduling aware of the data-center topology](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/topology_aware_scheduling/).

**kagent** is a Kubernetes native framework for building AI agents. Kubernetes is the most popular orchestration platform for running workloads, and **kagent** makes it easy to build, deploy and manage AI agents in Kubernetes. The **kagent** framework is designed to be easy to understand and use, and to provide a flexible and powerful way to build and manage AI agents.

## Getting Started

- [Quick Start](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/getting-started/quickstart)
- [Installation guide](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/introduction/installation)

## Technical Details

### Core Concepts

- **Agents**: Agents are the main building block of kagent. They are a system prompt, a set of tools and agents, and an LLM configuration represented with a Kubernetes custom resource called &quot;Agent&quot;. 
- **LLM Providers**: Kagent supports multiple LLM providers, including [OpenAI](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/openai), [Azure OpenAI](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/azure-openai), [Anthropic](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/anthropic), [Google Vertex AI](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/google-vertexai), [Ollama](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/ollama) and any other [custom providers and models](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/custom-models) accessible via AI gateways. Providers are represented by the ModelConfig resource.
- **MCP Tools**: Agents can connect to any MCP server that provides tools. Kagent comes with an MCP server with tools for Kubernetes, Istio, Helm, Argo, Prometheus, Grafana, Cilium, and others. All tools are Kubernetes custom resources (ToolServers) and can be used by multiple agents.
- **Observability**: Kagent supports [OpenTelemetry tracing](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/getting-started/tracing), which allows you to monitor what&#039;s happening with your agents and tools.

### Core Principles

- **Kubernetes Native**: Kagent is designed to be easy to understand and use, and to provide a flexible and powerful way to build and manage AI agents.
- **Extensible**: Kagent is designed to be extensible, so you can add your own agents and tools.
- **Flexible**: Kagent is designed to be flexible, to suit any AI agent use case.
- **Observable**: Kagent is designed to be observable, so you can monitor the agents and tools using all common monitoring frameworks.
- **Declarative**: Kagent is designed to be declarative, so you can define the agents and tools in a YAML file.
- **Testable**: Kagent is designed to be tested and debugged easily. This is especially important for AI agent applications.

### Architecture

The kagent framework is designed to be easy to understand and use, and to provide a flexible and powerful way to build and manage AI agents.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/arch.png&quot; alt=&quot;kagent&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Kagent has 4 core components:

- **Controller**: The controller is a Kubernetes controller that watches the kagent custom resources and creates the necessary resources to run the agents.
- **UI**: The UI is a web UI that allows you to manage the agents and tools.
- **Engine**: The engine runs your agents using [ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/).
- **CLI**: The CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage the agents and tools.

### Multiple Kubernetes Clusters and Multiple Clouds

&lt;img src =&quot;https://meshery.io/assets/images/screens/multi-cluster-management.gif&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Meshery provides a single pane of glass to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure, including various cloud providers. Meshery enables consistent configuration, operation, and observability across your entire Kubernetes landscape.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dry-run your deployments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
Meshery leverages Kubernetes&#039; built-in dry-run capabilities to allow you to simulate deployments without actually applying the changes to your cluster. This enables you to:

- Validate configurations: Ensure your deployment specifications (e.g., YAML manifests, Helm charts, Meshery Designs) are syntactically correct and will be accepted by the Kubernetes API server.   
- Identify potential issues: Detect errors in your configurations, such as invalid resource definitions, missing fields, or API version mismatches, before they impact your live environment.
- Preview changes: Understand the objects that Kubernetes would create or modify during a real deployment.
- Integrate with CI/CD: Incorporate dry-run as a step in your continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to automate pre-deployment checks and prevent faulty deployments.

By providing this dry-run functionality, Meshery helps you increase the reliability and stability of your Kubernetes deployments by catching potential problems early in the development and deployment process.
&lt;!-- 
Assess your cloud native infrastructure configuration against deployment and operational best practices with Meshery&#039;s configuration validator. Manage your workloads with confidence. Check your Kubernetes configuration for anti-patterns and avoid common pitfalls. --&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

### Visually and collaboratively manage your infrastructure

Using a GitOps-centric approach, visually and collaboratively design and manage your infrastructure and microservices. Meshery intelligently infers the manner in which each resource [interrelates](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/relationships) with each other. Meshery supports a broad variety of built-in relationships between components, which you can use to create your own custom relationships.

&lt;img alt=&quot;Meshery and Open Policy Agent Integration&quot; src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-policies-2.png&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;text-align:center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage built-in relationships to enforce configuration best practices consistently from code to Kubernetes. Customize Configure your infrastructure with confidence without needing to know or write Open Policy Agent&#039;s Rego query language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

## Workspaces: Your team&#039;s Google Drive for cloud native projects

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/workspace.gif&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;

Workspaces let you organize your work and serve as the central point of collaboration for you and your teams and point of access control to Environments and their resources.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Manage your connections with Environments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/environments.gif&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/environments&quot;&gt;Environments&lt;/a&gt;  make it easier for you to manage, share, and work with a collection of resources as a group, instead of dealing with all your Connections and Credentials on an individual basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;See changes to your infra before you merge&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-snapshot.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;

Get snapshots of your infrastructure directly in your PRs. Preview your deployment, view changes pull request-to-pull request and get infrastructure snapshots within your PRs by connecting Kanvas to your GitHub repositories.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;h3&gt;Operate with configuration best practices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assess your configurations against deployment and operational best practices with Meshery&#039;s configuration validator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Control all of your infrastructure with mesheryctl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether managing multiple Meshery deployments, importing designs, discoverying Kubernetes clusters, do so with ease using Meshery CLI in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --&gt;

## Platform Engineering with Meshery&#039;s Extension Points

Extend Meshery as your self-service engineering platform by taking advantage of its [vast set of extensibility features](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), including gRPC adapters, hot-loadable Reactjs packages and Golang plugins, subscriptions on NATS topics, consumable _and_ extendable API interfaces via REST and GraphQL.The great number of extension points in Meshery make it ideal as the foundation of your internal developer platform.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Access the Cloud Native Patterns for Kubernetes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design and manage all of your cloud native infrastructure using the design configurator in Meshery or start from a template using the patterns from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/catalog&quot;&gt;catalog&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/details&gt;

Meshery offers robust capabilities for managing multiple tenants within a shared Kubernetes infrastructure. Meshery provides the tools and integrations necessary to create a secure, isolated, and manageable multi-tenant environments, allowing multiple teams or organizations with granular control over their role-based access controls.

Meshery&#039;s &quot;multi-player&quot; functionality refers to its collaborative features that enable multiple users to interact with and manage cloud native infrastructure simultaneously. This is primarily facilitated through Kanvas, a Meshery extension visual designer and management interface.

## Performance Management

Meshery offers load generation and performance characterization to help you assess and optimize the performance of your applications and infrastructure.

&lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/images/readme/performance-metrics.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-cluster Kubernetes Manager&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create and reuse performance profiles for consistent characterization of the configuration of your infrastructure in context of how it performs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt; Manage the performance of your infrastructure and its workloads&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;img src = &quot;.github/assets/images/readme/meshery-performance.gif&quot;&gt;

Baseline and track your cloud native performance from release to release.

- Use performance profiles to track the historical performance of your workloads.
- Track your application performance from version to version.
- Understand behavioral differences between cloud native network functions.
- Compare performance across infrastructure deployments.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Load Generation and Microservice Performance Characteristization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;picture align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layer5io/layer5/master/src/assets/images/service-mesh-performance/stacked/smp-light-text.svg&quot;  width=&quot;18%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:10px;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

- **Multiple Load Generators:** Meshery supports various load generators, including Fortio, Wrk2, and Nighthawk, allowing users to choose the tool that best suits your needs.
- **Configurable Performance Profiles:** Meshery provides a highly configurable set of load profiles with tunable facets, enabling users to generate TCP, gRPC, and HTTP load. You can customize parameters such as duration, concurrent threads, concurrent generators, and load generator type. 
- **Statistical Analysis:** Meshery performs statistical analysis on the results of performance tests, presenting data in the form of histograms with latency buckets. Understand the distribution of response times and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Comparison of Test Results:** Meshery enables you to compare the difference in request performance (latency and throughput) between independent performance tests. Save your load test configurations as Performance Profiles, making it easy to rerun tests with the same settings and track performance variations over time.
- **Kubernetes Cluster and Workload Metrics:** - Meshery connects to one or more Prometheus servers to gather both cluster and application metrics. Meshery also integrates with Grafana, allowing you to import your existing dashboards and visualize performance data.

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to produce infrastructure agnostic tooling, Meshery uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Performance&lt;/a&gt; specification as a common format to capture and measure your infrastructure&#039;s performance against a universal cloud native performance index. Meshery participates in advancing cloud native infrastructure adoption through the standardization of APIs. Meshery enables you to measure the value provided by Docker, Kubernetes, or other cloud native infrastructure in the context of the overhead incurred.&lt;/p&gt;

## Introduction

Temporal is a durable execution platform that enables developers to build scalable applications without sacrificing productivity or reliability.
The Temporal server executes units of application logic called Workflows in a resilient manner that automatically handles intermittent failures, and retries failed operations.

Temporal is a mature technology that originated as a fork of Uber&#039;s Cadence.
It is developed by [Temporal Technologies](https://temporal.io/), a startup by the creators of Cadence.

## Retiring

[What You Need to Know about Ingress NGINX Retirement](https://www.kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11/ingress-nginx-retirement/):

* Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026.
* Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered.
* Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will not be broken.
  * Existing project artifacts such as Helm charts and container images will remain available.

## Overview

ingress-nginx was an Ingress controller for Kubernetes using [NGINX](https://www.nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy and load
balancer.

[Learn more about Ingress on the Kubernetes documentation site](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## Usage warnings

If you are not already using ingress-nginx, you should not be deploying it as it is [not being developed](#retiring). Instead you should identify a [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/) implementation and use it.

Do not use in multi-tenant Kubernetes production installations. This project assumes that users that can create Ingress objects are administrators of the cluster. See the [FAQ](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/faq/#faq) for more.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, review the [troubleshooting docs](docs/troubleshooting.md),
[search for an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues), or talk to us on the
[#ingress-nginx-users channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/ingress-nginx-users) on the Kubernetes Slack server.

## Changelog

See [the list of releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases) for all changes.
For detailed changes for each release, please check the [changelog-$version.md](./changelog) file for the release version.
For detailed changes on the `ingress-nginx` helm chart, please check the changelog folder for a specific version.
[CHANGELOG-$current-version.md](./charts/ingress-nginx/changelog) file.

### Supported Versions table

Supported versions for the ingress-nginx project mean that we have completed E2E tests, and they are passing for
the versions listed. Ingress-Nginx versions **may** work on older versions, but the project does not make that guarantee.

## About

The gRPC-Gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler
[protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).
It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which
translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the
[`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotations in your service definitions.

This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Docs

You can read our docs at:

- https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/

## Testimonials

&gt; We use the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of API requests per day,
&gt; and have been since 2018 and through all of that,
&gt; we have never had any issues with it.
&gt;
&gt; _- William Mill, [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/)_

## Background

gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming
languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is
combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional
RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining
backward-compatibility, supporting languages or clients that are not well supported by
gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful
JSON architecture.

This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.
A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all
that&#039;s needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.

## Installation

### Compile from source

The following instructions assume you are using
[Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) for dependency
management. Use a
[tool dependency](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
to track the versions of the following executable packages:

```go
// +build tools

package tools

import (
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot;
)
```

Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running

```sh
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### **Using the `tool` Directive in Go 1.24**

Starting from Go 1.24, the `tool` directive in `go.mod` provides a structured way to track and manage executable dependencies. This replaces the previous workaround of using a separate `tools.go` file with blank imports.

#### **Tracking Tools in `go.mod`**

Instead of manually importing tool dependencies in a Go source file, you can now use the `tool` directive in `go.mod` to declare the tools your project depends on. For example:

```go
module tools

go 1.24

tool (
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway

)
```

#### **Managing Tool Dependencies**

To add tools to your module, use the `-tool` flag with `go get`:

```sh
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
go get -tool google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
go get -tool google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This automatically updates `go.mod`, adding the tools under the `tool` directive along with `require` statements to ensure version tracking.

### Install Tools

Once the tool dependencies are properly recorded in the `go.mod` file, simply execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
go install tool
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### Download the binaries

You may alternatively download the binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
We generate [SLSA3 signatures](slsa.dev) using the OpenSSF&#039;s [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) during the release process. To verify a release binary:

1. Install the verification tool from [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation).
2. Download the provenance file `attestation.intoto.jsonl` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
3. Run the verifier:

```shell
slsa-verifier -artifact-path &lt;the-binary&gt; -provenance attestation.intoto.jsonl -source github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway -tag &lt;the-tag&gt;
```

Alternatively, see the section on remotely managed plugin versions below.

## Usage

### 1.Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers

`your_service.proto`:

```protobuf
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;

 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
   rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
 }
```

### 2. Generate gRPC stubs

This step generates the gRPC stubs that you can use to implement the service and consume from clients:

Here&#039;s an example `buf.gen.yaml` you can use to generate the stubs with [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf):

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

With this file in place, you can generate your files using `buf generate`.

&gt; For a complete example of using `buf generate` to generate protobuf stubs, see
&gt; [the boilerplate repo](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).
&gt; For more information on generating the stubs with buf, see
&gt; [the official documentation](https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage).

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, here&#039;s an example of what a command
might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . \
    --go_out ./gen/go/ --go_opt paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out ./gen/go/ --go-grpc_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 3. Implement your service in gRPC as usual.

### 4. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

At this point, you have 3 options:

- no further modifications, use the default mapping to HTTP semantics (method, path, etc.)
  - this will work on any `.proto` file, but will not allow setting HTTP paths, request parameters or similar
- additional `.proto` modifications to use a custom mapping
  - relies on parameters in the `.proto` file to set custom HTTP mappings
- no `.proto` modifications, but use an external configuration file
  - relies on an external configuration file to set custom HTTP mappings
  - mostly useful when the source proto file isn&#039;t under your control

#### 1. Using the default mapping

This requires no additional modification to the `.proto` file but does require enabling a specific option when executing the plugin.
The `generate_unbound_methods` should be enabled.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt generate_unbound_methods=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 2. With custom annotations

Add a [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotation to your .proto file

`your_service.proto`:

```diff
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;
+
+import &quot;google/api/annotations.proto&quot;;
+
 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
-  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
+  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
+    option (google.api.http) = {
+      post: &quot;/v1/example/echo&quot;
+      body: &quot;*&quot;
+    };
+  }
 }
```

&gt; You will need to provide the required third party protobuf files to the protobuf compiler.
&gt; If you are using [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf), this dependency can
&gt; be added to the `deps` array in your `buf.yaml` under the name
&gt; `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis`:
&gt;
&gt; ```yaml
&gt; version: v2
&gt; name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
&gt; deps:
&gt;   - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; Always run `buf dep update` after adding a dependency to your `buf.yaml`.

See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
and generated OpenAPI output.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you need to ensure the required
dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found
by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from the
[googleapis repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), and providing
them to `protoc` when running. The files you will need are:

```
google/api/annotations.proto
google/api/field_behavior.proto
google/api/http.proto
google/api/httpbody.proto
```

Here&#039;s what a `protoc` execution might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 3. External configuration

If you do not want to (or cannot) modify the proto file for use with gRPC-Gateway you can
alternatively use an external
[gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
[Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/)
for more information. This is best combined with the `standalone=true` option
to generate a file that can live in its own package, separate from the files
generated by the source protobuf file.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml \
    --grpc-gateway_opt standalone=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 5. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;flag&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog&quot;

  gw &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/proto/gen/go/your/service/v1/your_service&quot;  // Update
)

var (
  // command-line options:
  // gRPC server endpoint
  grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String(&quot;grpc-server-endpoint&quot;,  &quot;localhost:9090&quot;, &quot;gRPC server endpoint&quot;)
)

func run() error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()

  // Register gRPC server endpoint
  // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
  mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
  opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
  err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
  return http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8081&quot;, mux)
}

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  if err := run(); err != nil {
    grpclog.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

### 6. (Optional) Generate OpenAPI definitions using `protoc-gen-openapiv2`

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
  - local: protoc-gen-openapiv2
    out: gen/go
```

To use the custom protobuf annotations supported by `protoc-gen-openapiv2`, we need
another dependency added to our protobuf generation step. If you are using
`buf`, you can add the `buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway` dependency
to your `deps` array:

```yaml
version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
  - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
```

With `protoc` (just the swagger file):

```sh
protoc -I . --openapiv2_out ./gen/openapiv2 \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you will need to copy the protobuf
files from the `protoc-gen-openapiv2/options` directory of this repository,
and providing them to `protoc` when running.

Note that this plugin also supports generating OpenAPI definitions for unannotated methods;
use the `generate_unbound_methods` option to enable this.

It is possible with the HTTP mapping for a gRPC service method to create duplicate mappings
with the only difference being constraints on the path parameter.

`/v1/{name=projects/*}` and `/v1/{name=organizations/*}` both become `/v1/{name}`. When
this occurs the plugin will rename the path parameter with a &quot;\_1&quot; (or &quot;\_2&quot; etc) suffix
to differentiate the different operations. So in the above example, the 2nd path would become
`/v1/{name_1=organizations/*}`. This can also cause OpenAPI clients to URL encode the &quot;/&quot; that is
part of the path parameter as that is what OpenAPI defines in the specification. To allow gRPC gateway to
accept the URL encoded slash and still route the request, use the UnescapingModeAllCharacters or
UnescapingModeLegacy (which is the default currently though may change in future versions). See
[Customizing Your Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/)
for more information.

## Usage with remote plugins

As an alternative to all of the above, you can use `buf` with
[remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage)
to manage plugin versions and generation. An example `buf.gen.yaml` using remote
plugin generation looks like this:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.31.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.3.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/openapiv2:v2.16.2
    out: gen/openapiv2
```

This requires no local installation of any plugins. Be careful to use the same
version of the generator as the runtime library, i.e. if using `v2.16.2`, run

```shell
$ go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2@v2.16.2
```

To get the same version of the runtime in your `go.mod`.

Note that usage of remote plugins is incompatible with usage of external configuration files like [grpc_api_configuration](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/#using-an-external-configuration-file).

## Video intro

This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro to using the gRPC-Gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base: https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Parameters and flags

When using `buf` to generate stubs, flags and parameters are passed through
the `opt` field in your `buf.gen.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

During code generation with `protoc`, flags to gRPC-Gateway tools must be passed
through `protoc` using one of 2 patterns:

- as part of the `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out` `protoc` parameter: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out=&lt;flags&gt;:&lt;path&gt;`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
--openapiv2_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
```

- using additional `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt` parameters: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt=&lt;flag&gt;[,&lt;flag&gt;]*`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
--openapiv2_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
```

## Quick Start with Single Binary ##
* Download the latest binary from https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/releases and unzip a single binary file `weed` or `weed.exe`. Or run `go install github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed@latest`.
* `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin ; export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=key` as the admin credentials to access the object store.
* Run `weed server -dir=/some/data/dir -s3` to start one master, one volume server, one filer, and one S3 gateway. The difference with `weed mini` is that `weed mini` can auto configure based on the single host environment, while `weed server` requires manual configuration and are designed for production use.

Also, to increase capacity, just add more volume servers by running `weed volume -dir=&quot;/some/data/dir2&quot; -master=&quot;&lt;master_host&gt;:9333&quot; -port=8081` locally, or on a different machine, or on thousands of machines. That is it!

# Introduction #

SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

1. to store billions of files!
2. to serve the files fast!

SeaweedFS started as a blob store to handle small files efficiently. 
Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, 
the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, 
and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. 
This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, 
allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation).

There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file&#039;s metadata. 
It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases.

SeaweedFS started by implementing [Facebook&#039;s Haystack design paper](http://www.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf). 
Also, SeaweedFS implements erasure coding with ideas from 
[f4: Facebook’s Warm BLOB Storage System](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-muralidhar.pdf), and has a lot of similarities with [Facebook’s Tectonic Filesystem](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast21-pan.pdf) and [Google&#039;s Colossus File System](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system)

On top of the blob store, optional [Filer] can support directories and POSIX attributes. 
Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, 
e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc.

SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud. 
With hot data on local cluster, and warm data on the cloud with O(1) access time, 
SeaweedFS can achieve both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity.
What&#039;s more, the cloud storage access API cost is minimized. 
Faster and cheaper than direct cloud storage!

## Example: Using Seaweed Blob Store ##

By default, the master node runs on port 9333, and the volume nodes run on port 8080.
Let&#039;s start one master node, and two volume nodes on port 8080 and 8081. Ideally, they should be started from different machines. We&#039;ll use localhost as an example.

SeaweedFS uses HTTP REST operations to read, write, and delete. The responses are in JSON or JSONP format.

### Start Master Server ###

```
&gt; ./weed master
```

### Start Volume Servers ###

```
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data1&quot; -max=5  -master=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8080 &amp;
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data2&quot; -max=10 -master=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8081 &amp;
```

### Write A Blob ###

A blob, also referred as a needle, a chunk, or mistakenly as a file, is just a byte array. It can have attributes, such as name, mime type, create or update time, etc. But basically it is just a byte array of a relatively small size, such as 2 MB ~ 64 MB. The size is not fixed.

To upload a blob: first, send a HTTP POST, PUT, or GET request to `/dir/assign` to get an `fid` and a volume server URL:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign
{&quot;count&quot;:1,&quot;fid&quot;:&quot;3,01637037d6&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;,&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}
```

Second, to store the blob content, send a HTTP multi-part POST request to `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` from the response:

```
&gt; curl -F file=@/home/chris/myphoto.jpg http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;myphoto.jpg&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:43234,&quot;eTag&quot;:&quot;1cc0118e&quot;}
```

To update, send another POST request with updated blob content.

For deletion, send an HTTP DELETE request to the same `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` URL:

```
&gt; curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
```

### Save Blob Id ###

Now, you can save the `fid`, 3,01637037d6 in this case, to a database field.

The number 3 at the start represents a volume id. After the comma, it&#039;s one file key, 01, and a file cookie, 637037d6.

The volume id is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The file key is an unsigned 64-bit integer. The file cookie is an unsigned 32-bit integer, used to prevent URL guessing.

The file key and file cookie are both coded in hex. You can store the &lt;volume id, file key, file cookie&gt; tuple in your own format, or simply store the `fid` as a string.

If stored as a string, in theory, you would need 8+1+16+8=33 bytes. A char(33) would be enough, if not more than enough, since most uses will not need 2^32 volumes.

If space is really a concern, you can store the file id in the binary format. You would need one 4-byte integer for volume id, 8-byte long number for file key, and a 4-byte integer for the file cookie. So 16 bytes are more than enough.

### Read a Blob ###

Here is an example of how to render the URL.

First look up the volume server&#039;s URLs by the file&#039;s volumeId:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/lookup?volumeId=3
{&quot;volumeId&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}]}
```

Since (usually) there are not too many volume servers, and volumes don&#039;t move often, you can cache the results most of the time. Depending on the replication type, one volume can have multiple replica locations. Just randomly pick one location to read.

Now you can take the public URL, render the URL or directly read from the volume server via URL:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
```

Notice we add a file extension &quot;.jpg&quot; here. It&#039;s optional and just one way for the client to specify the file content type.

If you want a nicer URL, you can use one of these alternative URL formats:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6/my_preferred_name.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6
```

If you want to get a scaled version of an image, you can add some params:

```
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fit
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fill
```

### Rack-Aware and Data Center-Aware Replication ###

SeaweedFS applies the replication strategy at a volume level. So, when you are getting a blob id, you can specify the replication strategy. For example:

```
curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?replication=001
```

The replication parameter options are:

```
000: no replication
001: replicate once on the same rack
010: replicate once on a different rack, but same data center
100: replicate once on a different data center
200: replicate twice on two different data center
110: replicate once on a different rack, and once on a different data center
```

More details about replication can be found [on the wiki][Replication].

[Replication]: https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Replication

You can also set the default replication strategy when starting the master server.

### Allocate Blob Key on Specific Data Center ###

Volume servers can be started with a specific data center name:

```
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/1 -port=8080 -dataCenter=dc1
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/2 -port=8081 -dataCenter=dc2
```

When requesting a blob key, an optional &quot;dataCenter&quot; parameter can limit the assigned volume to the specific data center. For example, this specifies that the assigned volume should be limited to &#039;dc1&#039;:

```
 http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?dataCenter=dc1
```

## Blob Store Architecture ##

Usually distributed file systems split each file into chunks. A central server keeps a mapping of filenames to chunks, and also which chunks each chunk server has.

The main drawback is that the central server can&#039;t handle many small files efficiently, and since all read requests need to go through the central master, so it might not scale well for many concurrent users.

Instead of managing chunks, SeaweedFS manages data volumes in the master server. Each data volume is 32GB in size, and can hold a lot of blobs. And each storage node can have many data volumes. So the master node only needs to store the metadata about the volumes, which is a fairly small amount of data and is generally stable.

The actual blob metadata, which are the blob volume, offset, and size, is stored in each volume on volume servers. Since each volume server only manages metadata of blobs on its own disk, with only 16 bytes for each blob, all access can read the metadata just from memory and only needs one disk operation to actually read file data.

For comparison, consider that an xfs inode structure in Linux is 536 bytes.

Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by \*NIX kernels, written
in Go with pluggable metric collectors.

The [Windows exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter) is recommended for Windows users.
To expose NVIDIA GPU metrics, [prometheus-dcgm
](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter)
can be used.

## Installation and Usage

If you are new to Prometheus and `node_exporter` there is a [simple step-by-step guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/).

The `node_exporter` listens on HTTP port 9100 by default. See the `--help` output for more options.

### Ansible

For automated installs with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), there is the [Prometheus Community role](https://github.com/prometheus-community/ansible).

### Docker

The `node_exporter` is designed to monitor the host system. Deploying in containers requires
extra care in order to avoid monitoring the container itself.

For situations where containerized deployment is needed, some extra flags must be used to allow
the `node_exporter` access to the host namespaces.

Be aware that any non-root mount points you want to monitor will need to be bind-mounted
into the container.

If you start container for host monitoring, specify `path.rootfs` argument.
This argument must match path in bind-mount of host root. The node\_exporter will use
`path.rootfs` as prefix to access host filesystem.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --net=&quot;host&quot; \
  --pid=&quot;host&quot; \
  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot; \
  quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest \
  --path.rootfs=/host
```

For Docker compose, similar flag changes are needed.

```yaml
---
version: &#039;3.8&#039;

services:
  node_exporter:
    image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest
    container_name: node_exporter
    command:
      - &#039;--path.rootfs=/host&#039;
    network_mode: host
    pid: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - &#039;/:/host:ro,rslave&#039;
```

On some systems, the `timex` collector requires an additional Docker flag,
`--cap-add=SYS_TIME`, in order to access the required syscalls.

## Collectors

There is varying support for collectors on each operating system. The tables
below list all existing collectors and the supported systems.

Collectors are enabled by providing a `--collector.&lt;name&gt;` flag.
Collectors that are enabled by default can be disabled by providing a `--no-collector.&lt;name&gt;` flag.
To enable only some specific collector(s), use `--collector.disable-defaults --collector.&lt;name&gt; ...`.

### Include &amp; Exclude flags

A few collectors can be configured to include or exclude certain patterns using dedicated flags. The exclude flags are used to indicate &quot;all except&quot;, while the include flags are used to say &quot;none except&quot;. Note that these flags are mutually exclusive on collectors that support both.

Example:

```txt
--collector.filesystem.mount-points-exclude=^/(dev|proc|sys|var/lib/docker/.+|var/lib/kubelet/.+)($|/)
```

### Disabled by default

`node_exporter` also implements a number of collectors that are disabled by default.  Reasons for this vary by
collector, and may include:
* High cardinality
* Prolonged runtime that exceeds the Prometheus `scrape_interval` or `scrape_timeout`
* Significant resource demands on the host

You can enable additional collectors as desired by adding them to your
init system&#039;s or service supervisor&#039;s startup configuration for
`node_exporter` but caution is advised.  Enable at most one at a time,
testing first on a non-production system, then by hand on a single
production node.  When enabling additional collectors, you should
carefully monitor the change by observing the `
scrape_duration_seconds` metric to ensure that collection completes
and does not time out.  In addition, monitor the
`scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` metric to see the changes in
cardinality.

### Perf Collector

The `perf` collector may not work out of the box on some Linux systems due to kernel
configuration and security settings. To allow access, set the following `sysctl`
parameter:

```
sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=X
```

- 2 allow only user-space measurements (default since Linux 4.6).
- 1 allow both kernel and user measurements (default before Linux 4.6).
- 0 allow access to CPU-specific data but not raw tracepoint samples.
- -1 no restrictions.

Depending on the configured value different metrics will be available, for most
cases `0` will provide the most complete set. For more information see [`man 2
perf_event_open`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html).

By default, the `perf` collector will only collect metrics of the CPUs that
`node_exporter` is running on (ie
[`runtime.NumCPU`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#NumCPU). If this is
insufficient (e.g. if you run `node_exporter` with its CPU affinity set to
specific CPUs), you can specify a list of alternate CPUs by using the
`--collector.perf.cpus` flag. For example, to collect metrics on CPUs 2-6, you
would specify: `--collector.perf --collector.perf.cpus=2-6`. The CPU
configuration is zero indexed and can also take a stride value; e.g.
`--collector.perf --collector.perf.cpus=1-10:5` would collect on CPUs
1, 5, and 10.

The `perf` collector is also able to collect
[tracepoint](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/tracepoint.html)
counts when using the `--collector.perf.tracepoint` flag. Tracepoints can be
found using [`perf list`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/perf.1.html) or
from debugfs. And example usage of this would be
`--collector.perf.tracepoint=&quot;sched:sched_process_exec&quot;`.

### Sysctl Collector

The `sysctl` collector can be enabled with `--collector.sysctl`. It supports exposing numeric sysctl values
as metrics using the `--collector.sysctl.include` flag and string values as info metrics by using the
`--collector.sysctl.include-info` flag. The flags can be repeated. For sysctl with multiple numeric values,
an optional mapping can be given to expose each value as its own metric. Otherwise an `index` label is used
to identify the different fields.

#### Examples
##### Numeric values
###### Single values
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=vm.user_reserve_kbytes`:
`vm.user_reserve_kbytes = 131072` -&gt; `node_sysctl_vm_user_reserve_kbytes 131072`

###### Multiple values
A sysctl can contain multiple values, for example:
```
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096	131072	6291456
```
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=net.ipv4.tcp_rmem` the collector will expose:
```
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;0&quot;} 4096
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;1&quot;} 131072
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=&quot;2&quot;} 6291456
```
If the indexes have defined meaning like in this case, the values can be mapped to multiple metrics by appending the mapping to the --collector.sysctl.include flag:
Using `--collector.sysctl.include=net.ipv4.tcp_rmem:min,default,max` the collector will expose:
```
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_min 4096
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_default 131072
node_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_max 6291456
```

##### String values
String values need to be exposed as info metric. The user selects them by using the `--collector.sysctl.include-info` flag.

###### Single values
`kernel.core_pattern = core` -&gt; `node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.core_pattern_info&quot;, value=&quot;core&quot;} 1`

###### Multiple values
Given the following sysctl:
```
kernel.seccomp.actions_avail = kill_process kill_thread trap errno trace log allow
```
Setting `--collector.sysctl.include-info=kernel.seccomp.actions_avail` will yield:
```
node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.seccomp.actions_avail&quot;, index=&quot;0&quot;, value=&quot;kill_process&quot;} 1
node_sysctl_info{key=&quot;kernel.seccomp.actions_avail&quot;, index=&quot;1&quot;, value=&quot;kill_thread&quot;} 1
...
```

### Textfile Collector

The `textfile` collector is similar to the [Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway),
in that it allows exporting of statistics from batch jobs. It can also be used
to export static metrics, such as what role a machine has. The Pushgateway
should be used for service-level metrics. The `textfile` module is for metrics
that are tied to a machine.

To use it, set the `--collector.textfile.directory` flag on the `node_exporter` commandline. The
collector will parse all files in that directory matching the glob `*.prom`
using the [text
format](http://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). **Note:** Timestamps are not supported.

To atomically push completion time for a cron job:
```
echo my_batch_job_completion_time $(date +%s) &gt; /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom.$$
mv /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom.$$ /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom
```

To statically set roles for a machine using labels:
```
echo &#039;role{role=&quot;application_server&quot;} 1&#039; &gt; /path/to/directory/role.prom.$$
mv /path/to/directory/role.prom.$$ /path/to/directory/role.prom
```

### Filtering enabled collectors

The `node_exporter` will expose all metrics from enabled collectors by default.  This is the recommended way to collect metrics to avoid errors when comparing metrics of different families.

For advanced use the `node_exporter` can be passed an optional list of collectors to filter metrics. The parameters `collect[]` and `exclude[]` can be used multiple times (but cannot be combined).  In Prometheus configuration you can use this syntax under the [scrape config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#&lt;scrape_config&gt;).

Collect only `cpu` and `meminfo` collector metrics:
```
  params:
    collect[]:
      - cpu
      - meminfo
```

Collect all enabled collector metrics but exclude `netdev`:
```
  params:
    exclude[]:
      - netdev
```

This can be useful for having different Prometheus servers collect specific metrics from nodes.

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to
receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need
to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support
open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to
multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

Objectives:

- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.
- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.
- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.
- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.
- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.

## Community

The OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)
channel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via
video calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:

- meet the humans behind the project
- get an opinion about specific proposals
- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack
- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously

We rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to
allow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:

Tuesday:

- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)

Wednesday:

- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)
- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)

Contributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.
Post a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong
reasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to
identify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.

Remember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the
relevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull
request where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous
calls and don&#039;t want them to feel excluded.

## Supported OTLP version

This code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,
considered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability
definition
here.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)

## Stability levels

See [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.

## Compatibility

When used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.

Support for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:

1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.
2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.

Official OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.

## Verifying the images signatures

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.

We are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:

```console
$ cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt; \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  &lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;
```

where:

- `&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt;`: is the release that you want to validate
- `&lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;`: is the image that you want to check

Example:

```console
$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0

Verification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates

[{&quot;critical&quot;:{&quot;identity&quot;:{&quot;docker-reference&quot;:&quot;ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;docker-manifest-digest&quot;:&quot;sha256:5cea85bcbc734a3c0a641368e5a4ea9d31b472997e9f2feca57eeb4a147fcf1a&quot;},&quot;type&quot;:&quot;cosign

## What is Tailscale

Tailscale is [a modern VPN](https://tailscale.com/) built on top of
[Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/).
It [works like an overlay network](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/)
between the computers of your networks - using
[NAT traversal](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/).

Everything in Tailscale is Open Source, except the GUI clients for proprietary OS
(Windows and macOS/iOS), and the control server.

The control server works as an exchange point of Wireguard public keys for the
nodes in the Tailscale network. It assigns the IP addresses of the clients,
creates the boundaries between each user, enables sharing machines between users,
and exposes the advertised routes of your nodes.

A [Tailscale network (tailnet)](https://tailscale.com/kb/1136/tailnet/) is private
network which Tailscale assigns to a user in terms of private users or an
organisation.

## Design goal

Headscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) control server. Headscale&#039;s goal is to
provide self-hosters and hobbyists with an open-source server they can use for
their projects and labs. It implements a narrow scope, a _single_ Tailscale
network (tailnet), suitable for a personal use, or a small open-source
organisation.

## Supporting Headscale

If you like `headscale` and find it useful, there is a sponsorship and donation
buttons available in the repo.

## Features

Please see [&quot;Features&quot; in the documentation](https://headscale.net/stable/about/features/).

## Client OS support

Please see [&quot;Client and operating system support&quot; in the documentation](https://headscale.net/stable/about/clients/).

## Running headscale

**Please note that we do not support nor encourage the use of reverse proxies
and container to run Headscale.**

Please have a look at the [`documentation`](https://headscale.net/stable/).

## Disclaimer

This project is not associated with Tailscale Inc.

However, one of the active maintainers for Headscale [is employed by Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/blog/opensource) and he is allowed to spend work hours contributing to the project. Contributions from this maintainer are reviewed by other maintainers.

The maintainers work together on setting the direction for the project. The underlying principle is to serve the community of self-hosters, enthusiasts and hobbyists - while having a sustainable project.

## Contributing

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### Requirements

To contribute to headscale you would need the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org)
and [Buf](https://buf.build) (Protobuf generator).

We recommend using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to setup a development environment. This can
be done with `nix develop`, which will install the tools and give you a shell.
This guarantees that you will have the same dev env as `headscale` maintainers.

### Code style

To ensure we have some consistency with a growing number of contributions,
this project has adopted linting and style/formatting rules:

The **Go** code is linted with [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run) and
formatted with [`golines`](https://github.com/segmentio/golines) (width 88) and
[`gofumpt`](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt).
Please configure your editor to run the tools while developing and make sure to
run `make lint` and `make fmt` before committing any code.

The **Proto** code is linted with [`buf`](https://docs.buf.build/lint/overview) and
formatted with [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).

The **rest** (Markdown, YAML, etc) is formatted with [`prettier`](https://prettier.io).

Check out the `.golangci.yaml` and `Makefile` to see the specific configuration.

### Install development tools

- Go
- Buf
- Protobuf tools

Install and activate:

```shell
nix develop
```

### Testing and building

Some parts of the project require the generation of Go code from Protobuf
(if changes are made in `proto/`) and it must be (re-)generated with:

```shell
make generate
```

**Note**: Please check in changes from `gen/` in a separate commit to make it easier to review.

To run the tests:

```shell
make test
```

To build the program:

```shell
make build
```

### Development workflow

We recommend using Nix for dependency management to ensure you have all required tools. If you prefer to manage dependencies yourself, you can use Make directly:

**With Nix (recommended):**

```shell
nix develop
make test
make build
```

**With your own dependencies:**

```shell
make test
make build
```

The Makefile will warn you if any required tools are missing and suggest running `nix develop`. Run `make help` to see all available targets.
