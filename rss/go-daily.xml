            <h2>README</h2><pre># TypeScript 7

[Not sure what this is? Read the announcement post!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)

## Preview

A preview build is available on npm as `@typescript/native-preview`.

```sh
npm install @typescript/native-preview
npx tsgo # Use this as you would tsc.
```

A preview VS Code extension is [available on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.native-preview).

To use this, set this in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    &quot;typescript.experimental.useTsgo&quot;: true
}
```

## How to Build and Run

This repo uses [Go 1.24 or higher](https://go.dev/dl/), [Rust 1.85 or higher](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/), and [`hereby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hereby).

For tests and code generation, this repo contains a git submodule to the main TypeScript repo pointing to the commit being ported.
When cloning, you&#039;ll want to clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go.git
```

If you have already cloned the repo, you can initialize the submodule with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

With the submodule in place and `npm ci`, you can run tasks via `hereby`, similar to the TypeScript repo:

```sh
hereby build          # Verify that the project builds
hereby test           # Run all tests
hereby install-tools  # Install additional tools such as linters
hereby lint           # Run all linters
hereby format         # Format all code
hereby generate       # Generate all Go code (e.g. diagnostics, committed to repo)
```

Additional tasks are a work in progress.

`hereby` is not required to work on the repo; the regular `go` tooling (e.g., `go build`, `go test ./...`) will work as expected.
`hereby` tasks are provided as a convenience for those familiar with the TypeScript repo.

### Running `tsgo`

After running `hereby build`, you can run `built/local/tsgo`, which behaves mostly the same as `tsc`.

### Running LSP Prototype

To debug and run the VS Code extension without installing it globally:

* Run VS Code in the repo workspace (`code .`)
* Copy `.vscode/launch.template.json` to `.vscode/launch.json`
* &lt;kbd&gt;F5&lt;/kbd&gt; (or `Debug: Start Debugging` from the command palette)

This will launch a new VS Code instance which uses the Corsa LS as the backend. If correctly set up, you should see &quot;tsgo&quot; in the status bar when a TypeScript or JavaScript file is open:

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Entry point slightly different for now |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS5.8 |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently (in progress) |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JS Doc | not ready | - |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | not ready | Coming soon |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking |
| Build mode / project references | not ready | - |
| Incremental build | not ready | - |
| Language service (LSP) | prototype | Minimal functionality (errors, hover, go to def). More features coming soon |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TinyGo - Go compiler for small places

[![Linux](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/linux.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/linux.yml) [![macOS](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/build-macos.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/build-macos.yml) [![Windows](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/windows.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/windows.yml) [![Docker](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/docker.yml) [![Nix](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/nix.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/actions/workflows/nix.yml) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/tinygo-org/tinygo/tree/dev.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/tinygo-org/tinygo/tree/dev)

TinyGo is a Go compiler intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (wasm/wasi), and command-line tools.

It reuses libraries used by the [Go language tools](https://golang.org/pkg/go/) alongside [LLVM](http://llvm.org) to provide an alternative way to compile programs written in the Go programming language.

## Embedded

Here is an example program that blinks the built-in LED when run directly on any supported board with onboard LED:

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;machine&quot;
    &quot;time&quot;
)

func main() {
    led := machine.LED
    led.Configure(machine.PinConfig{Mode: machine.PinOutput})
    for {
        led.Low()
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)

        led.High()
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)
    }
}
```

The above program can be compiled and run without modification on an Arduino Uno, an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or any of the supported boards that have a built-in LED, just by setting the correct TinyGo compiler target. For example, this compiles and flashes an Arduino Uno:

```shell
tinygo flash -target arduino examples/blinky1
```

## WebAssembly

TinyGo is very useful for compiling programs both for use in browsers (WASM) as well as for use on servers and other edge devices (WASI).

TinyGo programs can run in [Fastly Compute](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/guides/compute/go/), [Fermyon Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/go-components), [wazero](https://wazero.io/languages/tinygo/) and many other WebAssembly runtimes.

Here is a small TinyGo program for use by a WASI host application:

```go
package main

//go:wasmexport add
func add(x, y uint32) uint32 {
	return x + y
}
```

This compiles the above TinyGo program for use on any WASI Preview 1 runtime:

```shell
tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared -o add.wasm -target=wasip1 add.go
```

You can also use the same syntax as Go 1.24+:

```shell
GOARCH=wasip1 GOOS=wasm tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared -o add.wasm add.go
```

## Installation

See the [getting started instructions](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/) for information on how to install TinyGo, as well as how to run the TinyGo compiler using our Docker container.

## Supported targets

## Project Scope

Goals:

* Have very small binary sizes. Don&#039;t pay for what you don&#039;t use.
* Support for most common microcontroller boards.
* Be usable on the web using WebAssembly.
* Good CGo support, with no more overhead than a regular function call.
* Support most standard library packages and compile most Go code without modification.

Non-goals:

* Be efficient while using zillions of goroutines. However, good goroutine support is certainly a goal.
* Be as fast as `gc`. However, LLVM will probably be better at optimizing certain things so TinyGo might actually turn out to be faster for number crunching.
* Be able to compile every Go program out there.

## Why this project exists

&gt; We never expected Go to be an embedded language and so its got serious problems...

-- Rob Pike, [GopherCon 2014 Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoS7DsT1rdM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2799)

TinyGo is a project to bring Go to microcontrollers and small systems with a single processor core. It is similar to [emgo](https://github.com/ziutek/emgo) but a major difference is that we want to keep the Go memory model (which implies garbage collection of some sort). Another difference is that TinyGo uses LLVM internally instead of emitting C, which hopefully leads to smaller and more efficient code and certainly leads to more flexibility.

The original reasoning was: if [Python](https://micropython.org/) can run on microcontrollers, then certainly [Go](https://golang.org/) should be able to run on even lower level micros.

## 👋 INTRODUCTION

SafeLine is a self-hosted **`WAF(Web Application Firewall)`** to protect your web apps from attacks and exploits.

A web application firewall helps protect web apps by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It typically protects web apps from attacks such as `SQL injection`, `XSS`, `code injection`, `os command injection`, `CRLF injection`, `ldap injection`, `xpath injection`, `RCE`, `XXE`, `SSRF`, `path traversal`, `backdoor`, `bruteforce`, `http-flood`, `bot abused`, among others.

#### 💡 How It Works

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/how-it-works.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;

By deploying a WAF in front of a web application, a shield is placed between the web application and the Internet. While a proxy server protects a client machine’s identity by using an intermediary, a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy, protecting the server from exposure by having clients pass through the WAF before reaching the server.

A WAF protects your web apps by filtering, monitoring, and blocking any malicious HTTP/S traffic traveling to the web application, and prevents any unauthorized data from leaving the app. It does this by adhering to a set of policies that help determine what traffic is malicious and what traffic is safe. Just as a proxy server acts as an intermediary to protect the identity of a client, a WAF operates in similar fashion but acting as a reverse proxy intermediary that protects the web app server from a potentially malicious client.

its core capabilities include:

- Defenses for web attacks
- Proactive bot abused defense 
- HTML &amp; JS code encryption
- IP-based rate limiting
- Web Access Control List

## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

## Documentation

Please see the Syncthing [documentation site][6] [[source]][17].

Chaos Mesh is an open source cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform. It offers various types of fault simulation and has an enormous capability to orchestrate fault scenarios.

Using Chaos Mesh, you can conveniently simulate various abnormalities that might occur in reality during the development, testing, and production environments and find potential problems in the system. To lower the threshold for a Chaos Engineering project, Chaos Mesh provides you with a visualization operation. You can easily design your Chaos scenarios on the Web UI and monitor the status of Chaos experiments.

Chaos Mesh is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) incubating project. If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who&#039;s involved and how Chaos Mesh plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/09/02/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-tikv-graduation/).

---

At the current stage, Chaos Mesh has the following components:

- **Chaos Operator**: the core component for chaos orchestration. Fully open sourced.
- **Chaos Dashboard**: a Web UI for managing, designing, monitoring Chaos Experiments.

See the following demo video for a quick view of Chaos Mesh:

[![Watch the video](./static/demo.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifZEwdJO868)

## Chaos Operator

Chaos Operator injects chaos into the applications and Kubernetes infrastructure in a manageable way, which provides easy, custom definitions for chaos experiments and automatic orchestration. There are two components at play:

**Chaos Controller Manager**: is primarily responsible for the scheduling and management of Chaos experiments. This component contains several CRD Controllers, such as Workflow Controller, Scheduler Controller, and Controllers of various fault types.

**Chaos Daemon**: runs as DaemonSet and has Privileged permission by default (which can be disabled). This component mainly interferes with specific network devices, file systems, kernels by hacking into the target Pod Namespace.

![Chaos Operator](./static/chaos-mesh.png)

Chaos Operator uses [CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) to define chaos objects.

The current implementation supports a few types of CRD objects for fault injection, namely `PodChaos`, `NetworkChaos`, `IOChaos`, `TimeChaos`, `StressChaos`, and so on.
You can get the full list of CRD objects and their specifications in the [Chaos Mesh Docs](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/).

This daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a webserver). Cloudflare attracts client requests and sends them to you
via this daemon, without requiring you to poke holes on your firewall --- your origin can remain as closed as possible.
Extensive documentation can be found in the [Cloudflare Tunnel section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps) of the Cloudflare Docs.
All usages related with proxying to your origins are available under `cloudflared tunnel help`.

You can also use `cloudflared` to access Tunnel origins (that are protected with `cloudflared tunnel`) for TCP traffic
at Layer 4 (i.e., not HTTP/websocket), which is relevant for use cases such as SSH, RDP, etc.
Such usages are available under `cloudflared access help`.

You can instead use [WARP client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/private-networks)
to access private origins behind Tunnels for Layer 4 traffic without requiring `cloudflared access` commands on the client side.


## Before you get started

Before you use Cloudflare Tunnel, you&#039;ll need to complete a few steps in the Cloudflare dashboard: you need to add a
website to your Cloudflare account. Note that today it is possible to use Tunnel without a website (e.g. for private
routing), but for legacy reasons this requirement is still necessary:
1. [Add a website to Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Creating-a-Cloudflare-account-and-adding-a-website)
2. [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205195708)


## Installing `cloudflared`

Downloads are available as standalone binaries, a Docker image, and Debian, RPM, and Homebrew packages. You can also find releases [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) on the `cloudflared` GitHub repository.

* You can [install on macOS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation#macos) via Homebrew or by downloading the [latest Darwin amd64 release](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases)
* Binaries, Debian, and RPM packages for Linux [can be found here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation#linux)
* A Docker image of `cloudflared` is [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared)
* You can install on Windows machines with the [steps here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation#windows)
* To build from source, first you need to download the go toolchain by running `./.teamcity/install-cloudflare-go.sh` and follow the output. Then you can run `make cloudflared`

User documentation for Cloudflare Tunnel can be found at https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps


## Creating Tunnels and routing traffic

Once installed, you can authenticate `cloudflared` into your Cloudflare account and begin creating Tunnels to serve traffic to your origins.

* Create a Tunnel with [these instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/)
* Route traffic to that Tunnel:
  * Via public [DNS records in Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/dns)
  * Or via a public hostname guided by a [Cloudflare Load Balancer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb)
  * Or from [WARP client private traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/)


## TryCloudflare

Want to test Cloudflare Tunnel before adding a website to Cloudflare? You can do so with TryCloudflare using the documentation [available here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/).

## Deprecated versions

Cloudflare currently supports versions of cloudflared that are **within one year** of the most recent release. Breaking changes unrelated to feature availability may be introduced that will impact versions released more than one year ago. You can read more about upgrading cloudflared in our [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/#updating-cloudflared).

For example, as of January 2023 Cloudflare will support cloudflared version 2023.1.1 to cloudflared 2022.1.1.

## Development

### Requirements
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [capnp](https://capnproto.org/install.html)
- [cloudflare go toolchain](https://github.com/cloudflare/go)
- Optional tools:
  - [capnpc-go](https://pkg.go.dev/zombiezen.com/go/capnproto2/capnpc-go)
  - [goimports](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
  - [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
  - [gomocks](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/mock)

### Build
To build cloudflared locally run `make cloudflared`

### Test
To locally run the tests run `make test`

### Linting
To format the code and keep a good code quality use `make fmt` and `make lint`

### Mocks
After changes on interfaces you might need to regenerate the mocks, so run `make mock`

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

- Find and use [popular software packaged as Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) to run in Kubernetes
- Share your own applications as Helm Charts
- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
- Manage releases of Helm packages

## Helm in a Handbasket

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Helm Development and Stable Versions

Helm v4 is currently under development on the `main` branch. This is unstable and the APIs within the Go SDK and at the command line are changing.
Helm v3 (current stable) is maintained on the `dev-v3` branch. APIs there follow semantic versioning.

## Install

Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest).

Unpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!

If you want to use a package manager:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install helm`.
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) users can use `choco install kubernetes-helm`.
- [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) users can use `winget install Helm.Helm`.
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) users can use `scoop install helm`.
- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) users can use `snap install helm --classic`.
- [Flox](https://flox.dev) users can use `flox install kubernetes-helm`.

To rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the [Quick Start Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/).

See the [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more options,
including installing pre-releases.

## Docs

Get started with the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://helm.sh/docs)

## Roadmap

The [Helm roadmap uses GitHub milestones](https://github.com/helm/helm/milestones) to track the progress of the project.

The development of Helm v4 is currently happening on the `main` branch while the development of Helm v3, the stable branch, is happening on the `dev-v3` branch. Changes should be made to the `main` branch prior to being added to the `dev-v3` branch so that all changes are carried along to Helm v4.

Read more about [incoming sources](#incoming-sources)

#### Two way audio

Supported for sources:

- [RTSP cameras](#source-rtsp) with [ONVIF Profile T](https://www.onvif.org/specs/stream/ONVIF-Streaming-Spec.pdf) (back channel connection)
- [DVRIP](#source-dvrip) cameras
- [TP-Link Tapo](#source-tapo) cameras
- [Hikvision ISAPI](#source-isapi) cameras
- [Roborock vacuums](#source-roborock) models with cameras
- [Exec](#source-exec) audio on server
- [Any Browser](#incoming-browser) as IP-camera

Two way audio can be used in browser with [WebRTC](#module-webrtc) technology. The browser will give access to the microphone only for HTTPS sites ([read more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52759992/how-to-access-camera-and-microphone-in-chrome-without-https)).

go2rtc also support [play audio](#stream-to-camera) files and live streams on this cameras.

#### Source: RTSP

```yaml
streams:
  sonoff_camera: rtsp://rtsp:12345678@192.168.1.123/av_stream/ch0
  dahua_camera:
    - rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=0&amp;unicast=true&amp;proto=Onvif
    - rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=1#backchannel=0
  amcrest_doorbell:
    - rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.123:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=0#backchannel=0
  unifi_camera: rtspx://192.168.1.123:7441/fD6ouM72bWoFijxK
  glichy_camera: ffmpeg:rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.123/live/ch00_1 
```

**Recommendations**

- **Amcrest Doorbell** users may want to disable two way audio, because with an active stream you won&#039;t have a call button working. You need to add `#backchannel=0` to the end of your RTSP link in YAML config file
- **Dahua Doorbell** users may want to change [audio codec](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/issues/49#issuecomment-2127107379) for proper 2-way audio. Make sure not to request backchannel multiple times by adding `#backchannel=0` to other stream sources of the same doorbell. The `unicast=true&amp;proto=Onvif` is preferred for 2-way audio as this makes the doorbell accept multiple codecs for the incoming audio
- **Reolink** users may want NOT to use RTSP protocol at all, some camera models have a very awful unusable stream implementation
- **Ubiquiti UniFi** users may want to disable HTTPS verification. Use `rtspx://` prefix instead of `rtsps://`. And don&#039;t use `?enableSrtp` [suffix](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/issues/81)
- **TP-Link Tapo** users may skip login and password, because go2rtc support login [without them](https://drmnsamoliu.github.io/video.html)
- If your camera has two RTSP links - you can add both of them as sources. This is useful when streams has different codecs, as example AAC audio with main stream and PCMU/PCMA audio with second stream
- If the stream from your camera is glitchy, try using [ffmpeg source](#source-ffmpeg). It will not add CPU load if you won&#039;t use transcoding
- If the stream from your camera is very glitchy, try to use transcoding with [ffmpeg source](#source-ffmpeg)

**Other options**

Format: `rtsp...#{param1}#{param2}#{param3}`

- Add custom timeout `#timeout=30` (in seconds)
- Ignore audio - `#media=video` or ignore video - `#media=audio` 
- Ignore two way audio API `#backchannel=0` - important for some glitchy cameras
- Use WebSocket transport `#transport=ws...`

**RTSP over WebSocket**

```yaml
streams:
  # WebSocket with authorization, RTSP - without
  axis-rtsp-ws:  rtsp://192.168.1.123:4567/axis-media/media.amp?overview=0&amp;camera=1&amp;resolution=1280x720&amp;videoframeskipmode=empty&amp;Axis-Orig-Sw=true#transport=ws://user:pass@192.168.1.123:4567/rtsp-over-websocket
  # WebSocket without authorization, RTSP - with
  dahua-rtsp-ws: rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.123/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;subtype=1&amp;proto=Private3#transport=ws://192.168.1.123/rtspoverwebsocket
```

#### Source: RTMP

You can get stream from RTMP server, for example [Nginx with nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).

```yaml
streams:
  rtmp_stream: rtmp://192.168.1.123/live/camera1
```

#### Source: HTTP

Support Content-Type:

- **HTTP-FLV** (`video/x-flv`) - same as RTMP, but over HTTP
- **HTTP-JPEG** (`image/jpeg`) - camera snapshot link, can be converted by go2rtc to MJPEG stream
- **HTTP-MJPEG** (`multipart/x`) - simple MJPEG stream over HTTP
- **MPEG-TS** (`video/mpeg`) - legacy [streaming format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_transport_stream)

Source also support HTTP and TCP streams with autodetection for different formats: **MJPEG**, **H.264/H.265 bitstream**, **MPEG-TS**.

```yaml
streams:
  # [HTTP-FLV] stream in video/x-flv format
  http_flv: http://192.168.1.123:20880/api/camera/stream/780900131155/657617
  
  # [JPEG] snapshots from Dahua camera, will be converted to MJPEG stream
  dahua_snap: http://admin:password@192.168.1.123/cgi-bin/snapshot.cgi?channel=1

  # [MJPEG] stream will be proxied without modification
  http_mjpeg: https://mjpeg.sanford.io/count.mjpeg

  # [MJPEG or H.264/H.265 bitstream or MPEG-TS]
  tcp_magic: tcp://192.168.1.123:12345

  # Add custom header
  custom_header: &quot;https://mjpeg.sanford.io/count.mjpeg#header=Authorization: Bearer XXX&quot;
```

**PS.** Dahua camera has bug: if you select MJPEG codec for RTSP second stream - snapshot won&#039;t work.

#### Source: ONVIF

*[New in v1.5.0](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/releases/tag/v1.5.0)*

The source is not very useful if you already know RTSP and snapshot links for your camera. But it can be useful if you don&#039;t.

**WebUI &gt; Add** webpage support ONVIF autodiscovery. Your server must be on the same subnet as the camera. If you use docker, you must use &quot;network host&quot;.

```yaml
streams:
  dahua1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123
  reolink1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123:8000
  tapo1: onvif://admin:password@192.168.1.123:2020
```

#### Source: FFmpeg

You can get any stream or file or device via FFmpeg and push it to go2rtc. The app will automatically start FFmpeg with the proper arguments when someone starts watching the stream.

- FFmpeg preistalled for **Docker** and **Hass Add-on** users
- **Hass Add-on** users can target files from [/media](https://www.home-assistant.io/more-info/local-media/setup-media/) folder

Format: `ffmpeg:{input}#{param1}#{param2}#{param3}`. Examples:

```yaml
streams:
  # [FILE] all tracks will be copied without transcoding codecs
  file1: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4

  # [FILE] video will be transcoded to H264, audio will be skipped
  file2: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4#video=h264

  # [FILE] video will be copied, audio will be transcoded to pcmu
  file3: ffmpeg:/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4#video=copy#audio=pcmu

  # [HLS] video will be copied, audio will be skipped
  hls: ffmpeg:https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_16x9/gear5/prog_index.m3u8#video=copy

  # [MJPEG] video will be transcoded to H264
  mjpeg: ffmpeg:http://185.97.122.128/cgi-bin/faststream.jpg#video=h264

  # [RTSP] video with rotation, should be transcoded, so select H264
  rotate: ffmpeg:rtsp://12345678@192.168.1.123/av_stream/ch0#video=h264#rotate=90
```

All trascoding formats has [built-in templates](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/blob/master/internal/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.go): `h264`, `h265`, `opus`, `pcmu`, `pcmu/16000`, `pcmu/48000`, `pcma`, `pcma/16000`, `pcma/48000`, `aac`, `aac/16000`.

But you can override them via YAML config. You can also add your own formats to config and use them with source params.

```yaml
ffmpeg:
  bin: ffmpeg  # path to ffmpeg binary
  h264: &quot;-codec:v libx264 -g:v 30 -preset:v superfast -tune:v zerolatency -profile:v main -level:v 4.1&quot;
  mycodec: &quot;-any args that supported by ffmpeg...&quot;
  myinput: &quot;-fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -timeout 5000000 -i {input}&quot;
  myraw: &quot;-ss 00:00:20&quot;
```

- You can use go2rtc stream name as ffmpeg input (ex. `ffmpeg:camera1#video=h264`)
- You can use `video` and `audio` params multiple times (ex. `#video=copy#audio=copy#audio=pcmu`)
- You can use `rotate` param with `90`, `180`, `270` or `-90` values, important with transcoding (ex. `#video=h264#rotate=90`)
- You can use `width` and/or `height` params, important with transcoding (ex. `#video=h264#width=1280`)
- You can use `drawtext` to add a timestamp (ex. `drawtext=x=2:y=2:fontsize=12:fontcolor=white:box=1:boxcolor=black`)
  - This will greatly increase the CPU of the server, even with hardware acceleration
- You can use `raw` param for any additional FFmpeg arguments (ex. `#raw=-vf transpose=1`)
- You can use `input` param to override default input template (ex. `#input=rtsp/udp` will change RTSP transport from TCP to UDP+TCP)
  - You can use raw input value (ex. `#input=-timeout 5000000 -i {input}`)
  - You can add your own input templates

Read more about [hardware acceleration](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/wiki/Hardware-acceleration).

**PS.** It is recommended to check the available hardware in the WebUI add page.

#### Source: FFmpeg Device

You can get video from any USB-camera or Webcam as RTSP or WebRTC stream. This is part of FFmpeg integration.

- check available devices in Web interface
- `video_size` and `framerate` must be supported by your camera!
- for Linux supported only video for now
- for macOS you can stream Facetime camera or whole Desktop!
- for macOS important to set right framerate

Format: `ffmpeg:device?{input-params}#{param1}#{param2}#{param3}`

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Trust Wallet Assets Info

![Check](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## Overview

Trust Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://trustwallet.com/assets/images/media/assets/horizontal_blue.png&#039; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

## How to add token

Please note that __brand new tokens are not accepted__,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and __non-minimal circulation__
(for limit details see &lt;https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/requirements&gt;).

### Assets App

The [Assets web app](https://assets.trustwallet.com) can be used for most new token additions (Github account is needed).

### Quick starter

Details of the repository structure and contribution guidelines are listed on the
[Developers site](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/new-asset).
Here is a quick starter summary for the most common use case.


## Documentation

For details, see the [Developers site](https://developer.trustwallet.com):

- [Contribution guidelines](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/repository_details)

- [FAQ](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-new-assets/faq)

## Scripts

There are several scripts available for maintainers:

- `make check` -- Execute validation checks; also used in continuous integration.
- `make fix` -- Perform automatic fixes where possible
- `make update-auto` -- Run automatic updates from external sources, executed regularly (GitHub action)
- `make add-token asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Create `info.json` file as asset template.
- `make add-tokenlist asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Adds a token to tokenlist.json.
- `make add-tokenlist-extended asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Adds a token to tokenlist-extended.json.

## On Checks

This repo contains a set of scripts for verification of all the information. Implemented as Golang scripts, available through `make check`, and executed in CI build; checks the whole repo.
There are similar check logic implemented:

- in assets-management app; for checking changed token files in PRs, or when creating a PR.  Checks diffs, can be run from browser environment.
- in merge-fee-bot, which runs as a GitHub app shows result in PR comment. Executes in a non-browser environment.

## Trading pair maintenance

Info on supported trading pairs are stored in `tokenlist.json` files.
Trading pairs can be updated --
from Uniswap/Ethereum and PancakeSwap/Smartchain -- using update script (and checking in changes).
Minimal limit values for trading pair inclusion are set in the [config file](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/blob/master/.github/assets.config.yaml).
There are also options for force-include and force-exclude in the config.

## Disclaimer

Trust Wallet team allows anyone to submit new assets to this repository. However, this does not mean that we are in direct partnership with all of the projects.

Trust Wallet team will reject projects that are deemed as scam or fraudulent after careful review.
Trust Wallet team reserves the right to change the terms of asset submissions at any time due to changing market conditions, risk of fraud, or any other factors we deem relevant.

Additionally, spam-like behavior, including but not limited to mass distribution of tokens to random addresses will result in the asset being flagged as spam and possible removal from the repository.

### What is DiceDB?

DiceDB is an open-source, fast, reactive, in-memory database optimized for modern hardware. Commonly used as a cache, it offers a familiar interface while enabling real-time data updates through query subscriptions. It delivers higher throughput and lower median latencies, making it ideal for modern workloads.

## Get started

### Setting up DiceDB with Docker

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```bash
$ docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb:latest
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and SDKs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you are looking to setup DiceDB for development or want to setup from source, refer
&gt; our [CONTRIBUTING/README.md](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING/README.md) guide.

## Setting up CLI

### Using cURL

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and you can install it by running the following command

```bash
$ sudo su
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you are working on unsupported OS (as per above script), you can always follow the installation instructions mentioned in the [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) repository.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you are looking to setup DiceDB for development or want to setup from source, refer
&gt; our [CONTRIBUTING/README.md](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING/README.md) guide.

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it&#039;ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don&#039;t need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It&#039;s based on software we use for our public [AdGuard DNS] servers, and both share a lot of code.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison&quot; id=&quot;comparison&quot; name=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparing AdGuard Home to other solutions&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adguard-dns&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adguard-dns&quot;&gt;How is this different from public AdGuard DNS servers?&lt;/a&gt;

Running your own AdGuard Home server allows you to do much more than using a public DNS server. It&#039;s a completely different level. See for yourself:

- Choose what exactly the server blocks and permits.

- Monitor your network activity.

- Add your own custom filtering rules.

- **Most importantly, it&#039;s your own server, and you are the only one who&#039;s in control.**

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-pi-hole&quot; id=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot; name=&quot;comparison-pi-hole&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;

At this point, AdGuard Home has a lot in common with Pi-Hole. Both block ads and trackers using the so-called “DNS sinkholing” method and both allow customizing what&#039;s blocked.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We&#039;re not going to stop here. DNS sinkholing is not a bad starting point, but this is just the beginning.

AdGuard Home provides a lot of features out-of-the-box with no need to install and configure additional software. We want it to be simple to the point when even casual users can set it up with minimal effort.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Some of the listed features can be added to Pi-Hole by installing additional software or by manually using SSH terminal and reconfiguring one of the utilities Pi-Hole consists of. However, in our opinion, this cannot be legitimately counted as a Pi-Hole&#039;s feature.

| Feature                                                                 | AdGuard&amp;nbsp;Home | Pi-Hole                                                   |

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-adblock&quot; id=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot; name=&quot;comparison-adblock&quot;&gt;How does AdGuard Home compare to traditional ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;

It depends.

DNS sinkholing is capable of blocking a big percentage of ads, but it lacks the flexibility and the power of traditional ad blockers. You can get a good impression about the difference between these methods by reading [this article][blog-adaway], which compares AdGuard for Android (a traditional ad blocker) to hosts-level ad blockers (which are almost identical to DNS-based blockers in their capabilities). This level of protection is enough for some users.

Additionally, using a DNS-based blocker can help to block ads, tracking and analytics requests on other types of devices, such as SmartTVs, smart speakers or other kinds of IoT devices (on which you can&#039;t install traditional ad blockers).

### &lt;a href=&quot;#comparison-limitations&quot; id=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot; name=&quot;comparison-limitations&quot;&gt;Known limitations&lt;/a&gt;

Here are some examples of what cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker:

- YouTube, Twitch ads;

- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram sponsored posts.

Essentially, any advertising that shares a domain with content cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker.

Is there a chance to handle this in the future?  DNS will never be enough to do this. Our only option is to use a content blocking proxy like what we do in the standalone AdGuard applications. We&#039;re [going to bring][issue-1228] this feature support to AdGuard Home in the future. Unfortunately, even in this case, there still will be cases when this won&#039;t be enough or would require quite a complicated configuration.

## &lt;a href=&quot;#how-to-build&quot; id=&quot;how-to-build&quot; name=&quot;how-to-build&quot;&gt;How to build from source&lt;/a&gt;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#prerequisites&quot; id=&quot;prerequisites&quot; name=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make init` to prepare the development environment.

You will need this to build AdGuard Home:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.24 or later;
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v20.19 or later;
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v10.8 or later;

### &lt;a href=&quot;#building&quot; id=&quot;building&quot; name=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt;

Open your terminal and execute these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome
cd AdGuardHome
make
```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The non-standard `-j` flag is currently not supported, so building with `make -j 4` or setting your `MAKEFLAGS` to include, for example, `-j 4` is likely to break the build. If you do have your `MAKEFLAGS` set to that, and you don&#039;t want to change it, you can override it by running `make -j 1`.

Check the [`Makefile`][src-makefile] to learn about other commands.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#building-cross&quot; id=&quot;building-cross&quot; name=&quot;building-cross&quot;&gt;Building for a different platform&lt;/a&gt;

You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports. In order to do this, specify `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables as macros when running `make`.

For example:

```sh
env GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039; make
```

or:

```sh
make GOOS=&#039;linux&#039; GOARCH=&#039;arm64&#039;
```

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#preparing-releases&quot; id=&quot;preparing-releases&quot; name=&quot;preparing-releases&quot;&gt;Preparing releases&lt;/a&gt;

You&#039;ll need [`snapcraft`] to prepare a release build. Once installed, run the following command:

```sh
make build-release CHANNEL=&#039;...&#039; VERSION=&#039;...&#039;
```

See the [`build-release` target documentation][targ-release].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#docker-image&quot; id=&quot;docker-image&quot; name=&quot;docker-image&quot;&gt;Docker image&lt;/a&gt;

Run `make build-docker` to build the Docker image locally (the one that we publish to DockerHub). Please note, that we&#039;re using [Docker Buildx][buildx] to build our official image.

You may need to prepare before using these builds:

- (Linux-only) Install Qemu:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes --credential yes
  ```

- Prepare the builder:

  ```sh
  docker buildx create --name buildx-builder --driver docker-container --use
  ```

See the [`build-docker` target documentation][targ-docker].

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#debugging-the-frontend&quot; id=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot; name=&quot;debugging-the-frontend&quot;&gt;Debugging the frontend&lt;/a&gt;

When you need to debug the frontend without recompiling the production version every time, for example to check how your labels would look on a form, you can run the frontend build a development environment.

1. In a separate terminal, run:

   ```sh
   ( cd ./client/ &amp;&amp; env NODE_ENV=&#039;development&#039; npm run watch )
   ```

2. Run your `AdGuardHome` binary with the `--local-frontend` flag, which instructs AdGuard Home to ignore the built-in frontend files and use those from the `./build/` directory.

3. Now any changes you make in the `./client/` directory should be recompiled and become available on the web UI. Make sure that you disable the browser cache to make sure that you actually get the recompiled version.

#### &lt;a href=&quot;#e2e-frontend-tests&quot; id=&quot;e2e-frontend-tests&quot; name=&quot;e2e-frontend-tests&quot;&gt;End-to-End (E2E) Frontend Tests&lt;/a&gt;

AdGuard Home uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for E2E testing. Tests are located in `tests/e2e`.

**Running Tests:**
- `npm run test:e2e` – run all tests (headless).
- `npm run test:e2e:interactive` – run tests interactively.
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` – run tests in debug mode.
- `npm run test:e2e:codegen` – generate new test code.

**Setup:**
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npx playwright install` to set up required browsers.

&gt; **Warning:** Playwright will download and install its own browser binaries for testing, which may differ from the browsers installed on your system.

### &lt;a href=&quot;#test-unstable-versions&quot; id=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot; name=&quot;test-unstable-versions&quot;&gt;Test unstable versions&lt;/a&gt;

There are two update channels that you can use:

- `beta`: beta versions of AdGuard Home. More or less stable versions, usually released every two weeks or more often.

- `edge`: the newest version of AdGuard Home from the development branch. New updates are pushed to this channel daily.

There are three options how you can install an unstable version:

1. [Snap Store]: look for the `beta` and `edge` channels.

2. [Docker Hub]: look for the `beta` and `edge` tags.

3. Standalone builds. Use the automated installation script or look for the available builds [on the Wiki][wiki-platf].

   Script to install a beta version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c beta
   ```

   Script to install an edge version:

   ```sh
   curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c edge
   ```

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

&lt;/p&gt;

See a complete [architecture overview](https://docs.netbird.io/about-netbird/how-netbird-works#architecture) for details.

### Community projects
-  [NetBird installer script](https://github.com/physk/netbird-installer)
-  [NetBird ansible collection by Dominion Solutions](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/dominion_solutions/netbird/)

**Note**: The `main` branch may be in an *unstable or even broken state* during development.
For stable versions, see [releases](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases).

### Support acknowledgement

In November 2022, NetBird joined the [StartUpSecure program](https://www.forschung-it-sicherheit-kommunikationssysteme.de/foerderung/bekanntmachungen/startup-secure) sponsored by The Federal Ministry of Education and Research of The Federal Republic of Germany. Together with [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) NetBird brings the security best practices and simplicity to private networking.

### Testimonials
We use open-source technologies like [WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/), [Pion ICE (WebRTC)](https://github.com/pion/ice), [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn), and [Rosenpass](https://rosenpass.eu). We very much appreciate the work these guys are doing and we&#039;d greatly appreciate if you could support them in any way (e.g., by giving a star or a contribution).

[Coder](https://coder.com) enables organizations to set up development environments in their public or private cloud infrastructure. Cloud development environments are defined with Terraform, connected through a secure high-speed Wireguard® tunnel, and automatically shut down when not used to save on costs. Coder gives engineering teams the flexibility to use the cloud for workloads most beneficial to them.

- Define cloud development environments in Terraform
  - EC2 VMs, Kubernetes Pods, Docker Containers, etc.
- Automatically shutdown idle resources to save on costs
- Onboard developers in seconds instead of days

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/hero-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Coder Hero Image&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Quickstart

The most convenient way to try Coder is to install it on your local machine and experiment with provisioning cloud development environments using Docker (works on Linux, macOS, and Windows).

```shell
# First, install Coder
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh

# Start the Coder server (caches data in ~/.cache/coder)
coder server

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to create your initial user,
# create a Docker template and provision a workspace
```

## Install

The easiest way to install Coder is to use our
[install script](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/install.sh) for Linux
and macOS. For Windows, use the latest `..._installer.exe` file from GitHub
Releases.

```shell
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can run the install script with `--dry-run` to see the commands that will be used to install without executing them. Run the install script with `--help` for additional flags.

&gt; See [install](https://coder.com/docs/install) for additional methods.

Once installed, you can start a production deployment with a single command:

```shell
# Automatically sets up an external access URL on *.try.coder.app
coder server

# Requires a PostgreSQL instance (version 13 or higher) and external access URL
coder server --postgres-url &lt;url&gt; --access-url &lt;url&gt;
```

Use `coder --help` to get a list of flags and environment variables. Use our [install guides](https://coder.com/docs/install) for a complete walkthrough.
