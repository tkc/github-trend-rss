# n.eko

Welcome to Neko, a self-hosted virtual browser that runs in Docker and uses WebRTC technology. Neko is a powerful tool that allows you to **run a fully-functional browser in a virtual environment**, giving you the ability to **access the internet securely and privately from anywhere**. With Neko, you can browse the web, **run applications**, and perform other tasks just as you would on a regular browser, all within a **secure and isolated environment**. Whether you are a developer looking to test web applications, a **privacy-conscious user seeking a secure browsing experience**, or simply someone who wants to take advantage of the **convenience and flexibility of a virtual browser**, Neko is the perfect solution.

In addition to its security and privacy features, Neko offers the **ability for multiple users to access it simultaneously**. This makes it an ideal solution for teams or organizations that need to share access to a browser, as well as for individuals who want to use **multiple devices to access the same virtual environment**. With Neko, you can **easily and securely share access to a browser with others**, without having to worry about maintaining separate configurations or settings. Whether you need to **collaborate on a project**, access shared resources, or simply want to **share access to a browser with friends or family**, Neko makes it easy to do so.

Neko is also a great tool for **hosting watch parties** and interactive presentations. With its virtual browser capabilities, Neko allows you to host watch parties and presentations that are **accessible from anywhere**, without the need for in-person gatherings. This makes it easy to **stay connected with friends and colleagues**, even when you are unable to meet in person. With Neko, you can easily host a watch party or give an **interactive presentation**, whether it&#039;s for leisure or work. Simply invite your guests to join the virtual environment, and you can share the screen and **interact with them in real-time**.

## About

This app uses WebRTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and he was able to figure out the rest.

Then I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore and it got eventually archived.

## Use-cases and comparison

Neko started as a virtual browser that is streamed using WebRTC to multiple users.
- It is **not only limited to a browser**; it can run anything that runs on linux (e.g. VLC). Browser only happens to be the most popular and widely used use-case.
- In fact, it is not limited to a single program either; you can install a full desktop environment (e.g. XFCE, KDE).
- Speaking of limits, it does not need to run in a container; you could install neko on your host, connect to your X server and control your whole VM.
- Theoretically it is not limited to only X server, anything that can be controlled and scraped periodically for images could be used instead.
  - Like implementing RDP or VNC protocol, where neko would only act as WebRTC relay server. This is currently only future.

Primary use case is connecting with multiple people, leveraging real time synchronization and interactivity:
- **Watch party** - watching video content together with multiple people and reacting to it (chat, emotes) - open source alternative to [giggl.app](https://giggl.app/) or [hyperbeam](https://watch.hyperbeam.com).
- **Interactive presentation** - not only screen sharing, but others can control the screen.
- **Collaborative tool** - brainstorming ideas, cobrowsing, code debugging together.
- **Support/Teaching** - interactively guiding people in controlled environment.
- **Embed anything** - embed virtual browser in your web app - open source alternative to [hyperbeam API](https://hyperbeam.com/).
  - open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants.
  - request rooms using API with [neko-rooms](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-rooms).

Other use cases that benefit from single-user:
- **Personal workspace** - streaming containerized apps and desktops to end-users - similar to [kasm](https://www.kasmweb.com/).
- **Persistent browser** - own browser with persistent cookies available anywhere - similar to [mightyapp](https://www.mightyapp.com/).
  - no state is left on the host browser after terminating the connection.
  - sensitive data like cookies are not transferred - only video is shared.
- **Throwaway browser** - a better solution for planning secret parties and buying birthday gifts off the internet.
  - use Tor Browser and [VPN](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-vpn) for additional anonymity.
  - mitigates risk of OS fingerprinting and browser vulnerabilities by running in container.
- **Session broadcasting** - broadcast room content using RTMP (to e.g. twitch or youtube...).
- **Session recording** - broadcast RTMP can be saved to a file using e.g. [nginx-rtmp](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/modules/rtmp-media-streaming/)
  - have clean environment when recording tutorials.
  - no need to hide bookmarks or use incognito mode.
- **Jump host** - access your internal applications securely without the need for VPN.
- **Automated browser** - you can install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and automate tasks while being able to actively intercept them.

Compared to clientless remote desktop gateway (e.g. [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) or [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) with [noVNC](https://novnc.com/)), installed with remote desktop server along with desired program (e.g. [linuxserver/firefox](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-firefox)) provides neko additionally:
- **Smooth video** because it uses WebRTC and not images sent over WebSockets.
- **Built in audio** support, what is not part of Apache Guacamole or noVNC.
- **Multi-participant control**, what is not natively supported by Apache Guacamole or noVNC.

### Why neko?

I like cats 🐱 (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I&#039;m a weeb/nerd.

***But why the cat butt?*** Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyways.

Uncloud is a lightweight clustering and container orchestration tool that lets you deploy and manage web apps across
cloud VMs and bare metal with minimised cluster management overhead. It creates a secure WireGuard mesh network between
your Docker hosts and provides automatic service discovery, load balancing, ingress with HTTPS, and simple CLI commands
to manage your apps.

Unlike traditional orchestrators, there&#039;s no central control plane and quorum to maintain. Each machine maintains a
synchronised copy of the cluster state through peer-to-peer communication, keeping cluster operations functional even if
some machines go offline.

Uncloud is the solution for developers who want the flexibility of self-hosted infrastructure without the operational
complexity of Kubernetes.

## ✨ Features

* **Deploy anywhere**: Combine cloud VMs, dedicated servers, and bare metal into a unified computing environment,
  regardless of location or provider.
* **Docker Compose**: Familiar [Docker Compose](https://compose-spec.io/) format for defining services and volumes. No
  need to learn a new bespoke DSL.
* **Zero-downtime deployments**: Rolling updates without service interruption. Automatic rollback on failure is coming
  soon.
* **[Unregistry](https://github.com/psviderski/unregistry) integration**: Build and push your Docker images directly to
  your machines without an external registry. It will transfer only the missing layers, making it fast and efficient.
* **Service discovery**: Built-in DNS server resolves service names to container IPs.
* **Persistent storage**: Run stateful services with Docker volumes managed across machines.
* **Zero-config private network**: Automatic WireGuard mesh with peer discovery and NAT traversal. Containers get unique
  IPs for direct cross-machine communication.
* **No control plane**: Fully decentralised design eliminates single points of failure and reduces operational overhead.
* **Imperative over declarative**: Favoring imperative operations over state reconciliation simplifies both the mental
  model and troubleshooting.
* **Managed DNS**: Automatic DNS records `*.&lt;id&gt;.cluster.uncloud.run` for services with public access via managed
  [Uncloud DNS](https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud-dns) service.
* **Automatic HTTPS**: Built-in Caddy reverse proxy handles TLS certificate provisioning and renewal using Let&#039;s
  Encrypt.
* **Docker-like CLI**: Familiar commands for managing both infrastructure and applications.
* **Remote management**: Control your entire infrastructure through SSH access to any single machine in the cluster.

## 🎬 Quick demo

The screenshot below demonstrates how I use Uncloud to deploy https://uncloud.run website to 2 remote machines from
the [`compose.yaml`](website/compose.yaml) file on my local machine.

It exposes the container port `8000/tcp` as HTTPS on the domain `uncloud.run`, served by the Caddy reverse proxy on the
remote machines. All managed by Uncloud.

![Uncloud compose deployment demo](.github/images/compose-deploy.jpg)

Here is a more advanced use case. Deploy a highly available web app with automatic HTTPS across multiple regions and
on-premises in just a couple minutes.

## 💫 Why Uncloud?

Modern cloud platforms like Heroku and Render offer amazing developer experiences but at a premium price. Traditional
container orchestrators like Kubernetes provide power and flexibility but require significant operational expertise. I
believe there&#039;s a sweet spot in between — a pragmatic solution for the majority of us who aren&#039;t running at Google
scale. You should be able to:

* **Own your infrastructure and data**: Whether driven by costs, compliance, or flexibility, run applications on any
  combination of cloud VMs and personal hardware while controlling your data and maintaining the cloud-like experience
  you love.
* **Stay simple as you grow**: Start with a single machine and add more whenever you need without changing your
  workflow. No worrying about highly-available control planes or complex YAML configurations.
* **Build with proven primitives**: Get production-grade networking, deployment primitives, service discovery, load
  balancing, and ingress with HTTPS out of the box without becoming a distributed systems expert.
* **Support sustainable computing** 🌿: Minimise system overhead to maximise resources available for your applications.

Uncloud&#039;s goal is to make deployment and management of containerised applications feel as seamless as using a cloud
platform, whether you&#039;re running on a $5 VPS, a spare Mac mini, or a rack of bare metal servers.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Install Uncloud CLI:

   ```bash
   brew install psviderski/tap/uncloud

   # or using curl (macOS/Linux)
   curl -fsS https://get.uncloud.run/install.sh | sh
   ```

   See [Installation](https://uncloud.run/docs/getting-started/install-cli) for more options.

2. Initialise your first machine:

   ```bash
   uc machine init root@your-server-ip
   ```

3. Deploy your app from a Docker image and publish its container port 8000 as HTTPS using `app.example.com` domain:

   ```bash
   uc run -p app.example.com:8000/https image/my-app
   ```

4. Create a DNS A record in your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.) that points `app.example.com` to your
   server&#039;s IP address. Allow a few minutes for DNS propagation.

   That&#039;s it! Your app is now running and accessible at https://app.example.com ✨

5. Clean up when you&#039;re done:

   ```bash
   uc ls
   # Copy the service name from the output and run the rm command:
   uc rm my-app-name
   ```

   If you want to fully uninstall Uncloud on a machine, run:

   ```bash
   uncloud-uninstall
   ```

1. The CLI SSHs into the machine and installs Docker, the `uncloudd` machine daemon and
   [corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion) service, managed by systemd.
2. Generates a unique WireGuard key pair, allocates a dedicated subnet `10.210.0.0/24` for the machine and its
   containers, and configures `uncloudd` accordingly. All subsequent communication happens with `uncloudd`
   through its gRPC API over SSH.
3. Configures and starts `corrosion`, a CRDT-based distributed SQLite database to share cluster state between machines.
4. Creates a Docker bridge network connected to the WireGuard interface.
5. This machine becomes an entry point for the newly created cluster which is stored in the cluster config under
   `~/.config/uncloud` on your local machine.

1. The second machine gets provisioned just like the first. A non-root SSH user will need `sudo` access.
2. Allocates a new subnet `10.210.1.0/24` for the second machine and its containers.
3. Registers the second machine in the cluster state and exchanges WireGuard keys with the first machine.
4. Both machines establish a WireGuard tunnel between each other, allowing Docker containers connected to the bridge
   network to communicate directly across machines.
5. Configures and starts `corrosion` on the second machine to sync the cluster state.
6. The second machine is added as an alternative entry point in the cluster config.
7. If one of the machines goes offline, the other machine can still serve cluster operations.

If one more machine is added, the process repeats with a new subnet. The new machine needs to establish a WireGuard
connection with only one of the existing machines. Other machines will learn about it through the shared cluster state
and automatically establish a WireGuard tunnel with it.

**When you run a service:**

```bash
$ uc run -p app.example.com:8000/https image/my-app

[+] Running service my-app-1b3b (replicated mode) 1/1
 ✔ Container my-app-1b3b-tcex on oracle-vm  Started

my-app-1b3b endpoints:
 • https://app.example.com → :8000
 • https://my-app-1b3b.xuw3xd.cluster.uncloud.run → :8000
```

1. CLI picks a machine to run your container.
2. `uncloudd` that the CLI communicates with uses [`grpc-proxy`](https://github.com/siderolabs/grpc-proxy) to forward
   the request to the target machine to launch a container there.
3. `uncloudd` on the target machine starts the Docker container in the bridge network and stores its info in the
   cluster&#039;s distributed state.
4. The container gets a cluster-unique IP address from the bridge network (in the `10.210.X.2-254` range) and becomes
   accessible from other machines in the cluster.
5. Caddy reverse proxy which runs in [`global`](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/deploy.md#mode)
   mode on each machine watches the cluster state for new services and updates its configuration to route traffic to the
   new container.

Look ma, no control plane or master nodes to maintain! Just a simple overlay network and eventually consistent state
sync that lets machines work together. Want to check on things or make changes? Connect to any machine either implicitly
using the CLI or directly over SSH. They all have the complete cluster state and can control everything. It&#039;s like each
machine is a full backup of your control plane.
&lt;/details&gt;

## 🙏 Inspiration &amp; Acknowledgements

I&#039;m grateful to the following projects that inspired Uncloud&#039;s design and implementation:

* [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) — for proving that even in the declarative era of Kubernetes there is a place for
  simple deployment tools that use imperative commands without complex orchestration. Kamal powers the multi-billion
  dollar company [37signals](https://37signals.com/) where it was created, and that&#039;s truly inspiring!
* [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) — for inspiring my vision for what self-hosted infrastructure should feel like, proving that
  developer experience and powerful infrastructure can coexist beautifully.
* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) — for pioneering the vision of decentralised flat mesh networking with an amazing
  user experience that feels like magic.
* [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos)
  and [KubeSpan](https://www.talos.dev/v1.10/talos-guides/network/kubespan/) — for the machine API design using
  [grpc-proxy](https://github.com/siderolabs/grpc-proxy) and for its elegant approach to secure WireGuard-based overlay
  networking with zero configuration.
* [Docker Swarm Classic](https://github.com/docker-archive/classicswarm) and
  [Rancher 1.x](http://rancher-com-website-main-elb-elb-1798790864.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/)
  — for showing the power of simplicity and pragmatism in container orchestration and that not every problem needs the
  complexity of Kubernetes.

Special thanks to the [Corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion) project by Fly.io for providing the distributed
SQLite database used to share Uncloud&#039;s cluster state.

            <p>Staging repo for development of native port of TypeScript</p>
            <p>Language: Go</p>
            <p>Stars: 23,136</p>
            <p>Forks: 753</p>
            <p>Stars today: 24 stars today</p>
            <h2>README</h2><pre># TypeScript 7

[Not sure what this is? Read the announcement post!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)

## Preview

A preview build is available on npm as [`@typescript/native-preview`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/native-preview).

```sh
npm install @typescript/native-preview
npx tsgo # Use this as you would tsc.
```

A preview VS Code extension is [available on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.native-preview).

To use this, set this in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    &quot;typescript.experimental.useTsgo&quot;: true
}
```

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 5.9. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 5.9 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | done | Done, though `tsconfig` errors may not be as helpful. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 5.9. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 5.9. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | in progress | Mostly complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit not complete. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled. |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps. |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Most functionality. More features coming soon. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.9, see CHANGES.md.

**LocalAI** is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that&#039;s compatible with OpenAI (Elevenlabs, Anthropic... ) API specifications for local AI inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families. Does not require GPU. It is created and maintained by [Ettore Di Giacinto](https://github.com/mudler).

## 💻 Quickstart

Run the installer script:

```bash
# Basic installation
curl https://localai.io/install.sh | sh
```

For more installation options, see [Installer Options](https://localai.io/installation/).

### macOS Download:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/releases/latest/download/LocalAI.dmg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-macOS-blue?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=apple&amp;logoColor=white&quot; alt=&quot;Download LocalAI for macOS&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&gt; Note: the DMGs are not signed by Apple as quarantined. See https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/issues/6268 for a workaround, fix is tracked here: https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/issues/6244

Or run with docker:

&gt; **💡 Docker Run vs Docker Start**
&gt; 
&gt; - `docker run` creates and starts a new container. If a container with the same name already exists, this command will fail.
&gt; - `docker start` starts an existing container that was previously created with `docker run`.
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#039;ve already run LocalAI before and want to start it again, use: `docker start -i local-ai`

### CPU only image:

```bash
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 localai/localai:latest
```

local-ai run llama-3.2-1b-instruct:q4_k_m
# Start LocalAI with the phi-2 model directly from huggingface
local-ai run huggingface://TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF/phi-2.Q8_0.gguf
# Install and run a model from the Ollama OCI registry
local-ai run ollama://gemma:2b
# Run a model from a configuration file
local-ai run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/.../phi-2.yaml
# Install and run a model from a standard OCI registry (e.g., Docker Hub)

1. 克隆仓库

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fish2018/pansou.git
cd pansou
```

2. 配置环境变量（可选）

#### 基础配置

| 环境变量 | 描述 | 默认值 | 说明 |
|----------|------|--------|------|
| **PORT** | 服务端口 | `8888` | 修改服务监听端口 |
| **PROXY** | SOCKS5代理 | 无 | 如：`PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080` |
| **HTTPS_PROXY/HTTP_PROXY** | HTTPS/HTTP代理 | 无 | 如：`HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1080`,`HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1080` |
| **CHANNELS** | 默认搜索的TG频道 | `tgsearchers3` | 多个频道用逗号分隔 |
| **ENABLED_PLUGINS** | 指定启用插件，多个插件用逗号分隔 | 无 | 必须显式指定 |

#### 认证配置（可选）

PanSou支持可选的安全认证功能，默认关闭。开启后，所有API接口（除登录接口外）都需要提供有效的JWT Token。详见[认证系统设计文档](docs/认证系统设计.md)。

| 环境变量 | 描述 | 默认值 | 说明 |
|----------|------|--------|------|
| **AUTH_ENABLED** | 是否启用认证 | `false` | 设置为`true`启用认证功能 |
| **AUTH_USERS** | 用户账号配置 | 无 | 格式：`user1:pass1,user2:pass2` |
| **AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRY** | Token有效期（小时） | `24` | JWT Token的有效时长 |

## API文档

### 认证说明

当启用认证功能（`AUTH_ENABLED=true`）时，除登录和健康检测接口外的所有API接口都需要提供有效的JWT Token。

**请求头格式**：
```
Authorization: Bearer &lt;your-jwt-token&gt;
```

**获取Token**：

1. 调用登录接口获取Token（详见下方[认证API](#认证API)）
2. 在后续所有API请求的Header中添加`Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;`
3. Token过期后需要重新登录获取新Token

**示例**：
```bash
# 未启用认证时
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/search \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#039;{&quot;kw&quot;:&quot;速度与激情&quot;}&#039;

# 启用认证时
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/search \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc...&quot; \

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](https://docs.ollama.com/import) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Generate embeddings from the CLI

```shell
ollama run embeddinggemma &quot;Your text to embed&quot;
```

You can also pipe text for scripted workflows:

```shell
echo &quot;Your text to embed&quot; | ollama run embeddinggemma
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

[![Farcaster Base](https://img.shields.io/badge/Farcaster_Base-3d8fcc)](https://farcaster.xyz/base)

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have an Ethereum L1 full node RPC available
2. Choose your network:
   - For mainnet: Use `.env.mainnet`
   - For testnet: Use `.env.sepolia`
3. Configure your L1 endpoints in the appropriate `.env` file:
   ```bash
   OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC=&lt;your-preferred-l1-rpc&gt;
   OP_NODE_L1_BEACON=&lt;your-preferred-l1-beacon&gt;
   OP_NODE_L1_BEACON_ARCHIVER=&lt;your-preferred-l1-beacon-archiver&gt;
   ```
4. Start the node:

   ```bash
   # For mainnet (default):
   docker compose up --build

   # For testnet:
   NETWORK_ENV=.env.sepolia docker compose up --build

   # To use a specific client (optional):
   CLIENT=reth docker compose up --build

   # For testnet with a specific client:
   NETWORK_ENV=.env.sepolia CLIENT=reth docker compose up --build
   ```

### Supported Clients

- `reth` (default)
- `geth`
- `nethermind`

## Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- Modern Multicore CPU
- 32GB RAM (64GB Recommended)

## Goals

Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full [Goals document][13].

Syncthing should be:

1. **Safe From Data Loss**

   Protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable
   precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#039;s files.

2. **Secure Against Attackers**

   Again, protecting the user&#039;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other
   goals, we must never allow the user&#039;s data to be susceptible to
   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

3. **Easy to Use**

   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.

4. **Automatic**

   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.

5. **Universally Available**

   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
   latest technology is not always available to every individual.

6. **For Individuals**

   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
   secure, and easy to use file synchronization.

7. **Everything Else**

   There are many things we care about that don&#039;t make it on to the list. It
   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
   with the stated goals above.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Docker

To run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8].
If you&#039;ve found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability,
please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the
Forum or issue tracker.

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run `go run build.go` and the
binaries are created in `./bin`. There&#039;s [a guide][5] with more details on the
build process.

## Signed Releases

Release binaries are GPG signed with the key available from
https://syncthing.net/security/. There is also a built-in automatic
upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a
compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS and Windows binaries are also
code-signed.

It combines vector similarity search with keyword filtering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reranking in a single query interface. Common use cases include RAG systems, semantic and image search, recommendation engines, chatbots, and content classification.

Weaviate supports two approaches to store vectors: automatic vectorization at import using [integrated models](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and others) or direct import of [pre-computed vector embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors). Production deployments benefit from built-in multi-tenancy, replication, RBAC authorization, and [many other features](#weaviate-features).

To get started quickly, have a look at one of these tutorials:

- [Quickstart - Weaviate Cloud](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart)
- [Quickstart - local Docker instance](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart/local)

## Installation

Weaviate offers multiple installation and deployment options:

- [Docker](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/docker-installation)
- [Kubernetes](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/k8s-installation)
- [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud)

See the [installation docs](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy) for more deployment options, such as [AWS](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/aws-marketplace) and [GCP](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/gcp-marketplace).

## Getting started

You can easily start Weaviate and a local vector embedding model with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
services:
  weaviate:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:1.32.2
    ports:
      - &quot;8080:8080&quot;
      - &quot;50051:50051&quot;
    environment:
      ENABLE_MODULES: text2vec-model2vec
      MODEL2VEC_INFERENCE_API: http://text2vec-model2vec:8080

  # A lightweight embedding model that will generate vectors from objects during import
  text2vec-model2vec:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/model2vec-inference:minishlab-potion-base-32M
```

Start Weaviate and the embedding service with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Install the Python client (or use another [client library](#client-libraries-and-apis)):

```bash
pip install -U weaviate-client
```

The following Python example shows how easy it is to populate a Weaviate database with data, create vector embeddings and perform semantic search:

```python
import weaviate
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, DataType, Property

# Connect to Weaviate
client = weaviate.connect_to_local()

# Create a collection
client.collections.create(
    name=&quot;Article&quot;,
    properties=[Property(name=&quot;content&quot;, data_type=DataType.TEXT)],
    vector_config=Configure.Vectors.text2vec_model2vec(),  # Use a vectorizer to generate embeddings during import
    # vector_config=Configure.Vectors.self_provided()  # If you want to import your own pre-generated embeddings
)

# Insert objects and generate embeddings
articles = client.collections.get(&quot;Article&quot;)
articles.data.insert_many(
    [
        {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Vector databases enable semantic search&quot;},
        {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Machine learning models generate embeddings&quot;},
        {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Weaviate supports hybrid search capabilities&quot;},
    ]
)

# Perform semantic search
results = articles.query.near_text(query=&quot;Search objects by meaning&quot;, limit=1)
print(results.objects[0])

client.close()
```

This example uses the `Model2Vec` vectorizer, but you can choose any other [embedding model provider](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) or [bring your own pre-generated vectors](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors).

Weaviate exposes [REST API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/rest), [gRPC API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/grpc), and [GraphQL API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/graphql) to communicate with the database server.

## Weaviate features

These features enable you to build AI-powered applications:

- **⚡ Fast Search Performance**: Perform complex semantic [searches](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/similarity) over billions of vectors in milliseconds. Weaviate&#039;s architecture is built in Go for speed and reliability, ensuring your AI applications are highly responsive even under heavy load. See our [ANN benchmarks](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/benchmarks/ann) for more info.

- **🔌 Flexible Vectorization**: Seamlessly vectorize data at import time with [integrated vectorizers](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) from OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, Google, and more. Or you can import [your own vector embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors).

- **🔍 Advanced Hybrid &amp; Image Search**: Combine the power of semantic search with traditional [keyword (BM25) search](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/bm25), [image search](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/image) and [advanced filtering](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/filters) to get the best results with a single API call.

- **🤖 Integrated RAG &amp; Reranking**: Go beyond simple retrieval with built-in [generative search (RAG)](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/generative) and [reranking](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/rerank) capabilities. Power sophisticated Q&amp;A systems, chatbots, and summarizers directly from your database without additional tooling.

- **📈 Production-Ready &amp; Scalable**: Weaviate is built for mission-critical applications. Go from rapid prototyping to production at scale with native support for [horizontal scaling](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/horizontal-scaling), [multi-tenancy](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/manage-collections/multi-tenancy), [replication](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/replication), and fine-grained [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/rbac).

- **💰 Cost-Efficient Operations**: Radically lower resource consumption and operational costs with built-in [vector compression](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/compression). Vector quantization and multi-vector encoding reduce memory usage with minimal impact on search performance.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## What is Nebula?
Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool with a focus on performance, simplicity and security.
It lets you seamlessly connect computers anywhere in the world. Nebula is portable, and runs on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, and Android.
It can be used to connect a small number of computers, but is also able to connect tens of thousands of computers.

Nebula incorporates a number of existing concepts like encryption, security groups, certificates,
and tunneling.
What makes Nebula different to existing offerings is that it brings all of these ideas together,
resulting in a sum that is greater than its individual parts.

Further documentation can be found [here](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/).

You can read more about Nebula [here](https://medium.com/p/884110a5579).

## Technical Overview

Nebula is a mutually authenticated peer-to-peer software-defined network based on the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/).
Nebula uses certificates to assert a node&#039;s IP address, name, and membership within user-defined groups.
Nebula&#039;s user-defined groups allow for provider agnostic traffic filtering between nodes.
Discovery nodes (aka lighthouses) allow individual peers to find each other and optionally use UDP hole punching to establish connections from behind most firewalls or NATs.
Users can move data between nodes in any number of cloud service providers, datacenters, and endpoints, without needing to maintain a particular addressing scheme.

Nebula uses Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (`ECDH`) key exchange and `AES-256-GCM` in its default configuration.

Nebula was created to provide a mechanism for groups of hosts to communicate securely, even across the internet, while enabling expressive firewall definitions similar in style to cloud security groups.

## Getting started (quickly)

To set up a Nebula network, you&#039;ll need:

#### 1. The [Nebula binaries](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/releases) or [Distribution Packages](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula#distribution-packages) for your specific platform. Specifically you&#039;ll need `nebula-cert` and the specific nebula binary for each platform you use.

#### 2. (Optional, but you really should..) At least one discovery node with a routable IP address, which we call a lighthouse.

Nebula lighthouses allow nodes to find each other, anywhere in the world. A lighthouse is the only node in a Nebula network whose IP should not change. Running a lighthouse requires very few compute resources, and you can easily use the least expensive option from a cloud hosting provider. If you&#039;re not sure which provider to use, a number of us have used $6/mo [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplets as lighthouses.

Once you have launched an instance, ensure that Nebula udp traffic (default port udp/4242) can reach it over the internet.

#### 3. A Nebula certificate authority, which will be the root of trust for a particular Nebula network.

```sh
./nebula-cert ca -name &quot;Myorganization, Inc&quot;
```

This will create files named `ca.key` and `ca.cert` in the current directory. The `ca.key` file is the most sensitive file you&#039;ll create, because it is the key used to sign the certificates for individual nebula nodes/hosts. Please store this file somewhere safe, preferably with strong encryption.

**Be aware!** By default, certificate authorities have a 1-year lifetime before expiration. See [this guide](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/guides/rotating-certificate-authority/) for details on rotating a CA.

#### 4. Nebula host keys and certificates generated from that certificate authority

This assumes you have four nodes, named lighthouse1, laptop, server1, host3. You can name the nodes any way you&#039;d like, including FQDN. You&#039;ll also need to choose IP addresses and the associated subnet. In this example, we are creating a nebula network that will use 192.168.100.x/24 as its network range. This example also demonstrates nebula groups, which can later be used to define traffic rules in a nebula network.
```sh
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;lighthouse1&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.1/24&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;laptop&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.2/24&quot; -groups &quot;laptop,home,ssh&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;server1&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.9/24&quot; -groups &quot;servers&quot;
./nebula-cert sign -name &quot;host3&quot; -ip &quot;192.168.100.10/24&quot;
```

By default, host certificates will expire 1 second before the CA expires. Use the `-duration` flag to specify a shorter lifetime.

#### 5. Configuration files for each host

Download a copy of the nebula [example configuration](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/blob/master/examples/config.yml).

* On the lighthouse node, you&#039;ll need to ensure `am_lighthouse: true` is set.

* On the individual hosts, ensure the lighthouse is defined properly in the `static_host_map` section, and is added to the lighthouse `hosts` section.


#### 6. Copy nebula credentials, configuration, and binaries to each host

For each host, copy the nebula binary to the host, along with `config.yml` from step 5, and the files `ca.crt`, `{host}.crt`, and `{host}.key` from step 4.

**DO NOT COPY `ca.key` TO INDIVIDUAL NODES.**

#### 7. Run nebula on each host

```sh
./nebula -config /path/to/config.yml
```

For more detailed instructions, [find the full documentation here](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/).

## Building Nebula from source

Make sure you have [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed and clone this repo. Change to the nebula directory.

To build nebula for all platforms:
`make all`

To build nebula for a specific platform (ex, Windows):
`make bin-windows`

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for more details on build targets

## Curve P256 and BoringCrypto

The default curve used for cryptographic handshakes and signatures is Curve25519. This is the recommended setting for most users. If your deployment has certain compliance requirements, you have the option of creating your CA using `nebula-cert ca -curve P256` to use NIST Curve P256. The CA will then sign certificates using ECDSA P256, and any hosts using these certificates will use P256 for ECDH handshakes.

In addition, Nebula can be built using the [BoringCrypto GOEXPERIMENT](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.20/src/crypto/internal/boring/README.md) by running either of the following make targets:

```sh
make bin-boringcrypto
make release-boringcrypto
```

This is not the recommended default deployment, but may be useful based on your compliance requirements.

## Credits

Nebula was created at Slack Technologies, Inc by Nate Brown and Ryan Huber, with contributions from Oliver Fross, Alan Lam, Wade Simmons, and Lining Wang.

fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-preview.png&quot; width=640&gt;

It&#039;s an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command
history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. It implements
a &quot;fuzzy&quot; matching algorithm, so you can quickly type in patterns with omitted
characters and still get the results you want.

Highlights
----------

- **Portable** — Distributed as a single binary for easy installation
- **Fast** — Optimized to process millions of items instantly
- **Versatile** — Fully customizable through an event-action binding mechanism
- **All-inclusive** — Comes with integrations for Bash, Zsh, Fish, Vim, and Neovim

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/fzf.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/fzf/versions)

### Windows packages

On Windows, fzf is available via [Chocolatey][choco], [Scoop][scoop],
[Winget][winget], and [MSYS2][msys2]:

| Package manager | Command                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Chocolatey      | `choco install fzf`                   |
| Scoop           | `scoop install fzf`                   |
| Winget          | `winget install fzf`                  |
| MSYS2 (pacman)  | `pacman -S $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-fzf` |

[choco]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/fzf
[scoop]: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/master/bucket/fzf.json
[winget]: https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/j/junegunn/fzf
[msys2]: https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-fzf

### Using git

Alternatively, you can &quot;git clone&quot; this repository to any directory and run
[install](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/install) script.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
```

The install script will add lines to your shell configuration file to modify
`$PATH` and set up shell integration.

### Binary releases

You can download the official fzf binaries from the releases page.

* https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases

### Setting up shell integration

Add the following line to your shell configuration file.

* bash
  ```sh
  # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
  eval &quot;$(fzf --bash)&quot;
  ```
* zsh
  ```sh
  # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
  source &lt;(fzf --zsh)
  ```
* fish
  ```fish
  # Set up fzf key bindings
  fzf --fish | source
  ```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; `--bash`, `--zsh`, and `--fish` options are only available in fzf 0.48.0 or
&gt; later. If you have an older version of fzf, or want finer control, you can
&gt; source individual script files in the [/shell](/shell) directory. The
&gt; location of the files may vary depending on the package manager you use.
&gt; Please refer to the package documentation for more information.
&gt; (e.g. `apt show fzf`)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can disable CTRL-T, CTRL-R, or ALT-C bindings by setting the
&gt; corresponding `*_COMMAND` variable to an empty string when sourcing the
&gt; script. For example, to disable CTRL-R and ALT-C:
&gt;
&gt; * bash: `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval &quot;$(fzf --bash)&quot;`
&gt; * zsh: `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source &lt;(fzf --zsh)`
&gt; * fish: `fzf --fish | FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source`
&gt;
&gt; Setting the variables after sourcing the script will have no effect.

### Vim/Neovim plugin

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this to
your Vim configuration file:

```vim
Plug &#039;junegunn/fzf&#039;, { &#039;do&#039;: { -&gt; fzf#install() } }
Plug &#039;junegunn/fzf.vim&#039;
```

* `junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions
    * `fzf#install()` makes sure that you have the latest binary
* `junegunn/fzf.vim` is [a separate project](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
  that provides a variety of useful commands

To learn more about the Vim integration, see [README-VIM.md](README-VIM.md).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out
&gt; [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua).

Upgrading fzf
-------------

fzf is being actively developed, and you might want to upgrade it once in a
while. Please follow the instruction below depending on the installation
method used.

- git: `cd ~/.fzf &amp;&amp; git pull &amp;&amp; ./install`
- brew: `brew update; brew upgrade fzf`
- macports: `sudo port upgrade fzf`
- chocolatey: `choco upgrade fzf`
- vim-plug: `:PlugUpdate fzf`

Building fzf
------------

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

Usage
-----

fzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the
selected item to STDOUT.

```sh
find * -type f | fzf &gt; selected
```

Without STDIN pipe, fzf will traverse the file system under the current
directory to get the list of files.

```sh
vim $(fzf)
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You can override the default behavior
&gt; * Either by setting `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to a command that generates the desired list
&gt; * Or by setting `--walker`, `--walker-root`, and `--walker-skip` options in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we&#039;ve presented
&gt; the above as it&#039;s easier to grasp
&gt; ```sh
&gt; fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim
&gt; ```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process.
&gt;
&gt; ```sh
&gt; fzf --bind &#039;enter:become(vim {})&#039;
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; *See [Turning into a different process](#turning-into-a-different-process)
&gt; for more information.*

### Using the finder

- `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down
- `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit
- On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items
- Emacs style key bindings
- Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on
  multi-select mode

### Display modes

fzf by default runs in fullscreen mode, but there are other display modes.

#### `--height` mode

With `--height HEIGHT[%]`, fzf will start below the cursor with the given height.

```sh
fzf --height 40%
```

`reverse` layout and `--border` goes well with this option.

```sh
fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border
```

By prepending `~` to the height, you&#039;re setting the maximum height.

```sh
# Will take as few lines as possible to display the list
seq 3 | fzf --height ~100%
seq 3000 | fzf --height ~100%
```

Height value can be a negative number.

```sh
# Screen height - 3
fzf --height -3
```

#### `--tmux` mode

With `--tmux` option, fzf will start in a tmux popup.

```sh
# --tmux [center|top|bottom|left|right][,SIZE[%]][,SIZE[%][,border-native]]

fzf --tmux center         # Center, 50% width and height
fzf --tmux 80%            # Center, 80% width and height
fzf --tmux 100%,50%       # Center, 100% width and 50% height
fzf --tmux left,40%       # Left, 40% width
fzf --tmux left,40%,90%   # Left, 40% width, 90% height
fzf --tmux top,40%        # Top, 40% height
fzf --tmux bottom,80%,40% # Bottom, 80% width, 40% height
```

`--tmux` is silently ignored when you&#039;re not on tmux.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re stuck with an old version of tmux that doesn&#039;t support popup,
&gt; or if you want to open fzf in a regular tmux pane, check out
&gt; [fzf-tmux](bin/fzf-tmux) script.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can add these options to `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` so that they&#039;re applied by
&gt; default. For example,
&gt;
&gt; ```sh
&gt; # Open in tmux popup if on tmux, otherwise use --height mode
&gt; export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&#039;--height 40% --tmux bottom,40% --layout reverse --border top&#039;
&gt; ```

### Search syntax

Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in &quot;extended-search mode&quot; where you can
type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. `^music .mp3$ sbtrkt
!fire`

| Token     | Match type                              | Description                                  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------  | ------------------------------------------   |
| `sbtrkt`  | fuzzy-match                             | Items that match `sbtrkt`                    |
| `&#039;wild`   | exact-match (quoted)                    | Items that include `wild`                    |
| `&#039;wild&#039;`  | exact-boundary-match (quoted both ends) | Items that include `wild` at word boundaries |
| `^music`  | prefix-exact-match                      | Items that start with `music`                |
| `.mp3$`   | suffix-exact-match                      | Items that end with `.mp3`                   |
| `!fire`   | inverse-exact-match                     | Items that do not include `fire`             |
| `!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match              | Items that do not start with `music`         |
| `!.mp3$`  | inverse-suffix-exact-match              | Items that do not end with `.mp3`            |

If you don&#039;t prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to &quot;quote&quot; every word,
start fzf with `-e` or `--exact` option. Note that when  `--exact` is set,
`&#039;`-prefix &quot;unquotes&quot; the term.

A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following
query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either `go`, `rb`,
or `py`.

```
^core go$ | rb$ | py$
```

### Environment variables

- `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`
    - Default command to use when input is tty
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=&#039;fd --type f&#039;`
- `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`
    - Default options
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&quot;--layout=reverse --inline-info&quot;`
- `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE`
    - If you prefer to manage default options in a file, set this variable to
      point to the location of the file
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE=~/.fzfrc`

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is not used by shell integration due to the
&gt; slight difference in requirements.
&gt;
&gt; * `CTRL-T` runs `$FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to get a list of files and directories
&gt; * `ALT-C` runs `$FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to get a list of directories
&gt; * `vim ~/**&lt;tab&gt;` runs `fzf_compgen_path()` with the prefix (`~/`) as the first argument
&gt; * `cd foo**&lt;tab&gt;` runs `fzf_compgen_dir()` with the prefix (`foo`) as the first argument
&gt;
&gt; The available options are described later in this document.

### Customizing the look

The user interface of fzf is fully customizable with a large number of
configuration options. For a quick setup, you can start with one of the style
presets — `default`, `full`, or `minimal` — using the `--style` option.

```sh
fzf --style full \
    --preview &#039;fzf-preview.sh {}&#039; --bind &#039;focus:transform-header:file --brief {}&#039;
```

| Preset    | Screenshot                                                                             |
| :---      | :---                                                                                   |
| `default` | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-default.png&quot;/&gt; |
| `full`    | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-full.png&quot;/&gt;    |
| `minimal` | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-minimal.png&quot;/&gt; |

Here&#039;s an example based on the `full` preset:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-4-borders.png&quot;/&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

```sh
git ls-files | fzf --style full \
    --border --padding 1,2 \
    --border-label &#039; Demo &#039; --input-label &#039; Input &#039; --header-label &#039; File Type &#039; \
    --preview &#039;fzf-preview.sh {}&#039; \
    --bind &#039;result:transform-list-label:
        if [[ -z $FZF_QUERY ]]; then
          echo &quot; $FZF_MATCH_COUNT items &quot;
        else
          echo &quot; $FZF_MATCH_COUNT matches for [$FZF_QUERY] &quot;
        fi
        &#039; \
    --bind &#039;focus:transform-preview-label:[[ -n {} ]] &amp;&amp; printf &quot; Previewing [%s] &quot; {}&#039; \
    --bind &#039;focus:+transform-header:file --brief {} || echo &quot;No file selected&quot;&#039; \
    --bind &#039;ctrl-r:change-list-label( Reloading the list )+reload(sleep 2; git ls-files)&#039; \
    --color &#039;border:#aaaaaa,label:#cccccc&#039; \
    --color &#039;preview-border:#9999cc,preview-label:#ccccff&#039; \
    --color &#039;list-border:#669966,list-label:#99cc99&#039; \
    --color &#039;input-border:#996666,input-label:#ffcccc&#039; \
    --color &#039;header-border:#6699cc,header-label:#99ccff&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

Key bindings for command-line
-----------------------------

By [setting up shell integration](#setting-up-shell-integration), you can use
the following key bindings in bash, zsh, and fish.

- `CTRL-T` - Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line
    - The list is generated using `--walker file,dir,follow,hidden` option
        - You can override the behavior by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to a custom command that generates the desired list
        - Or you can set `--walker*` options in `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS`
    - Set `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf
      ```sh
      # Preview file content using bat (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
      export FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS=&quot;
        --walker-skip .git,node_modules,target
        --preview &#039;bat -n --color=always {}&#039;
        --bind &#039;ctrl-/:change-preview-window(down|hidden|)&#039;&quot;
      ```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cloudflare Tunnel client

Contains the command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel, a tunneling daemon that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins.
This daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a webserver). Cloudflare attracts client requests and sends them to you
via this daemon, without requiring you to poke holes on your firewall --- your origin can remain as closed as possible.
Extensive documentation can be found in the [Cloudflare Tunnel section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel) of the Cloudflare Docs.
All usages related with proxying to your origins are available under `cloudflared tunnel help`.

You can also use `cloudflared` to access Tunnel origins (that are protected with `cloudflared tunnel`) for TCP traffic
at Layer 4 (i.e., not HTTP/websocket), which is relevant for use cases such as SSH, RDP, etc.
Such usages are available under `cloudflared access help`.

You can instead use [WARP client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/)
to access private origins behind Tunnels for Layer 4 traffic without requiring `cloudflared access` commands on the client side.


## Before you get started

Before you use Cloudflare Tunnel, you&#039;ll need to complete a few steps in the Cloudflare dashboard: you need to add a
website to your Cloudflare account. Note that today it is possible to use Tunnel without a website (e.g. for private
routing), but for legacy reasons this requirement is still necessary:
1. [Add a website to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/)
2. [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/)


## Installing `cloudflared`

Downloads are available as standalone binaries, a Docker image, and Debian, RPM, and Homebrew packages. You can also find releases [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) on the `cloudflared` GitHub repository.

* You can [install on macOS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/#macos) via Homebrew or by downloading the [latest Darwin amd64 release](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases)
* Binaries, Debian, and RPM packages for Linux [can be found here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/#linux)
* A Docker image of `cloudflared` is [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared)
* You can install on Windows machines with the [steps here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/#windows)
* To build from source, install the required version of go, mentioned in the [Development](#development) section below. Then you can run `make cloudflared`.

User documentation for Cloudflare Tunnel can be found at https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/


## Creating Tunnels and routing traffic

Once installed, you can authenticate `cloudflared` into your Cloudflare account and begin creating Tunnels to serve traffic to your origins.

* Create a Tunnel with [these instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/)
* Route traffic to that Tunnel:
  * Via public [DNS records in Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/dns/)
  * Or via a public hostname guided by a [Cloudflare Load Balancer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/public-load-balancers/)
  * Or from [WARP client private traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/)


## TryCloudflare

Want to test Cloudflare Tunnel before adding a website to Cloudflare? You can do so with TryCloudflare using the documentation [available here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/).

## Deprecated versions

Cloudflare currently supports versions of cloudflared that are **within one year** of the most recent release. Breaking changes unrelated to feature availability may be introduced that will impact versions released more than one year ago. You can read more about upgrading cloudflared in our [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/update-cloudflared/).

For example, as of January 2023 Cloudflare will support cloudflared version 2023.1.1 to cloudflared 2022.1.1.
