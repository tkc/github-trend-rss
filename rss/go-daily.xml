Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.

**Important defaults**: Erigon 3 is a Full Node by default. (Erigon 2 was an [Archive Node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/archive-nodes/#what-is-an-archive-node) by default.)
Set `--prune.mode` to &quot;archive&quot; if you need an archive node or to &quot;minimal&quot; if you run a validator on a small disk (not allowed to change after first start).

System Requirements
===================

RAM: &gt;=32GB, [Golang &gt;= 1.23](https://golang.org/doc/install); GCC 10+ or Clang; On Linux: kernel &gt; v4. 64-bit
architecture.

- ArchiveNode Ethereum Mainnet: 2TB (May 2025). FullNode: 1.1TB (May 2025)
- ArchiveNode Gnosis: 640GB (May 2025). FullNode: 300GB (June 2024)
- ArchiveNode Polygon Mainnet: 4.1TB (April 2024). FullNode: 2Tb (April 2024)

SSD or NVMe. Do not recommend HDD - on HDD Erigon will always stay N blocks behind chain tip, but not fall behind.
Bear in mind that SSD performance deteriorates when close to capacity. CloudDrives (like
gp3): Blocks Execution is slow

Sync Times
==========

These are the  approximate sync times syncing from scratch to the tip of the chain (results may vary depending on hardware and bandwidth).


| Chain      | Archive         | Full           | Minimal        |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Ethereum   | 7 Hours, 55 Minutes | 4 Hours, 23 Minutes | 1 Hour, 41 Minutes |
| Gnosis     | 2 Hours, 10 Minutes | 1 Hour, 5 Minutes  | 33 Minutes      |
| Polygon    | 1 Day, 21 Hours    | 21 Hours, 41 Minutes | 11 Hours, 54 Minutes |

Usage
=====

### Getting Started

[Release Notes and Binaries](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/releases)

Build latest release (this will be suitable for most users just wanting to run a node):

```sh
git clone --branch release/&lt;x.xx&gt; --single-branch https://github.com/erigontech/erigon.git
cd erigon
make erigon
./build/bin/erigon
```

Increase download speed by `--torrent.download.rate=20mb`. &lt;code&gt;🔬
See [Downloader docs](./cmd/downloader/readme.md)&lt;/code&gt;

Use `--datadir` to choose where to store data.

Use `--chain=gnosis` for [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosis.io/), `--chain=bor-mainnet` for Polygon Mainnet,
and `--chain=amoy` for Polygon Amoy.
For Gnosis Chain you need a [Consensus Layer](#beacon-chain-consensus-layer) client alongside
Erigon (https://docs.gnosischain.com/category/step--3---run-consensus-client).

Running `make help` will list and describe the convenience commands available in the [Makefile](./Makefile).

### Datadir structure

```sh
datadir        
    chaindata     # &quot;Recently-updated Latest State&quot;, &quot;Recent History&quot;, &quot;Recent Blocks&quot;
    snapshots     # contains `.seg` files - it&#039;s old blocks
        domain    # Latest State
        history   # Historical values 
        idx       # InvertedIndices: can search/filtering/union/intersect them - to find historical data. like eth_getLogs or trace_transaction
        accessor # Additional (generated) indices of history - have &quot;random-touch&quot; read-pattern. They can serve only `Get` requests (no search/filters).
    txpool        # pending transactions. safe to remove.
    nodes         # p2p peers. safe to remove.
    temp          # used to sort data bigger than RAM. can grow to ~100gb. cleaned at startup.
   
# There is 4 domains: account, storage, code, commitment 
```

### History on cheap disk

If you can afford store datadir on 1 nvme-raid - great. If can&#039;t - it&#039;s possible to store history on cheap drive.

```sh
# place (or ln -s) `datadir` on slow disk. link some sub-folders to fast (low-latency) disk.
# Example: what need link to fast disk to speedup execution
datadir        
    chaindata   # link to fast disk
    snapshots   
        domain    # link to fast disk
        history   
        idx       
        accessor 
    temp # buffers to sort data &gt;&gt; RAM. sequential-buffered IO - is slow-disk-friendly   

# Example: how to speedup history access: 
#   - go step-by-step - first try store `accessor` on fast disk
#   - if speed is not good enough: `idx`
#   - if still not enough: `history` 
```

### Erigon3 datadir size

```sh
# eth-mainnet - archive - Nov 2024

du -hsc /erigon/chaindata
15G 	/erigon/chaindata

du -hsc /erigon/snapshots/* 
120G 	/erigon/snapshots/accessor
300G	/erigon/snapshots/domain
280G	/erigon/snapshots/history
430G	/erigon/snapshots/idx
2.3T	/erigon/snapshots
```

```sh
# bor-mainnet - archive - Nov 2024

du -hsc /erigon/chaindata
20G 	/erigon/chaindata

du -hsc /erigon/snapshots/* 
360G	/erigon-data/snapshots/accessor
1.1T	/erigon-data/snapshots/domain
750G	/erigon-data/snapshots/history
1.5T	/erigon-data/snapshots/idx
4.9T	/erigon/snapshots
```

### Erigon3 changes from Erigon2

- **Initial sync doesn&#039;t re-exec from 0:** downloading 99% LatestState and History
- **Per-Transaction granularity of history** (Erigon2 had per-block). Means:
    - Can execute 1 historical transaction - without executing it&#039;s block
    - If account X change V1-&gt;V2-&gt;V1 within 1 block (different transactions): `debug_getModifiedAccountsByNumber` return
      it
    - Erigon3 doesn&#039;t store Logs (aka Receipts) - it always re-executing historical txn (but it&#039;s cheaper)
- **Validator mode**: added. `--internalcl` is enabled by default. to disable use `--externalcl`.
- **Store most of data in immutable files (segments/snapshots):**
    - can symlink/mount latest state to fast drive and history to cheap drive
    - `chaindata` is less than `15gb`. It&#039;s ok to `rm -rf chaindata`. (to prevent grow: recommend `--batchSize &lt;= 1G`)
- **`--prune` flags changed**: see `--prune.mode` (default: `full`, archive: `archive`, EIP-4444: `minimal`)
- **Other changes:**
    - ExecutionStage included many E2 stages: stage_hash_state, stage_trie, log_index, history_index, trace_index
    - Restart doesn&#039;t loose much partial progress: `--sync.loop.block.limit=5_000` enabled by default

### Logging

_Flags:_

- `verbosity`
- `log.console.verbosity` (overriding alias for `verbosity`)
- `log.json`
- `log.console.json` (alias for `log.json`)
- `log.dir.path`
- `log.dir.prefix`
- `log.dir.verbosity`
- `log.dir.json`

In order to log only to the stdout/stderr the `--verbosity` (or `log.console.verbosity`) flag can be used to supply an
int value specifying the highest output log level:

```
  LvlCrit = 0
  LvlError = 1
  LvlWarn = 2
  LvlInfo = 3
  LvlDebug = 4
  LvlTrace = 5
```

To set an output dir for logs to be collected on disk, please set `--log.dir.path` If you want to change the filename
produced from `erigon` you should also set the `--log.dir.prefix` flag to an alternate name. The
flag `--log.dir.verbosity` is
also available to control the verbosity of this logging, with the same int value as above, or the string value e.g. &#039;
debug&#039; or &#039;info&#039;. Default verbosity is &#039;debug&#039; (4), for disk logging.

Log format can be set to json by the use of the boolean flags `log.json` or `log.console.json`, or for the disk
output `--log.dir.json`.

### Modularity

Erigon by default is &quot;all in one binary&quot; solution, but it&#039;s possible start TxPool as separated processes.
Same true about: JSON RPC layer (RPCDaemon), p2p layer (Sentry), history download layer (Downloader), consensus.
Don&#039;t start services as separated processes unless you have clear reason for it: resource limiting, scale, replace by
your own implementation, security.
How to start Erigon&#039;s services as separated processes, see in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml).
Each service has own `./cmd/*/README.md` file.
[Erigon Blog](https://erigon.tech/blog/).

### Embedded Consensus Layer

Built-in consensus for Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia, Holesky, Hoodi, Gnosis, Chiado.
To use external Consensus Layer: `--externalcl`.

### Testnets

If you would like to give Erigon a try: a good option is to start syncing one of the public testnets, Holesky (or Amoy).
It syncs much quicker, and does not take so much disk space:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/erigontech/erigon.git
cd erigon
make erigon
./build/bin/erigon --datadir=&lt;your_datadir&gt; --chain=holesky --prune.mode=full
```

Please note the `--datadir` option that allows you to store Erigon files in a non-default location. Name of the
directory `--datadir` does not have to match the name of the chain in `--chain`.

### Block Production (PoS Validator)

Block production is fully supported for Ethereum &amp; Gnosis Chain. It is still experimental for Polygon.

### Config Files TOML

You can set Erigon flags through a TOML configuration file with the flag `--config`. The flags set in the
configuration file can be overwritten by writing the flags directly on Erigon command line

`./build/bin/erigon --config ./config.toml --chain=sepolia`

Assuming we have `chain : &quot;mainnet&quot;` in our configuration file, by adding `--chain=sepolia` allows the overwrite of the
flag inside of the toml configuration file and sets the chain to sepolia

```toml
datadir = &#039;your datadir&#039;
port = 1111
chain = &quot;mainnet&quot;
http = true
&quot;private.api.addr&quot;=&quot;localhost:9090&quot;

&quot;http.api&quot; = [&quot;eth&quot;,&quot;debug&quot;,&quot;net&quot;]
```

### Beacon Chain (Consensus Layer)

Erigon can be used as an Execution Layer (EL) for Consensus Layer clients (CL). Default configuration is OK.

If your CL client is on a different device, add `--authrpc.addr 0.0.0.0` ([Engine API] listens on localhost by default)
as well as `--authrpc.vhosts &lt;CL host&gt;` where `&lt;CL host&gt;` is your source host or `any`.

[Engine API]: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine

In order to establish a secure connection between the Consensus Layer and the Execution Layer, a JWT secret key is
automatically generated.

The JWT secret key will be present in the datadir by default under the name of `jwt.hex` and its path can be specified
with the flag `--authrpc.jwtsecret`.

This piece of info needs to be specified in the Consensus Layer as well in order to establish connection successfully.
More information can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/authentication.md).

Once Erigon is running, you need to point your CL client to `&lt;erigon address&gt;:8551`,
where `&lt;erigon address&gt;` is either `localhost` or the IP address of the device running Erigon, and also point to the JWT
secret path created by Erigon.

### Caplin

Caplin is a full-fledged validating Consensus Client like Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku, Nimbus and Lodestar. Its goal is:

* provide better stability
* Validation of the chain
* Stay in sync
* keep the execution of blocks on chain tip
* serve the Beacon API using a fast and compact data model alongside low CPU and memory usage.

The main reason why developed a new Consensus Layer is to experiment with the possible benefits that could come with it.
For example, The Engine API does not work well with Erigon. The Engine API sends data one block at a time, which does
not suit how Erigon works. Erigon is designed to handle many blocks simultaneously and needs to sort and process data
efficiently. Therefore, it would be better for Erigon to handle the blocks independently instead of relying on the
Engine API.

#### Caplin&#039;s Usage

Caplin is be enabled by default. to disable it and enable the Engine API, use the `--externalcl` flag. from that point
on, an external Consensus Layer will not be need
anymore.

Caplin also has an archival mode for historical states and blocks. it can be enabled through the `--caplin.archive`
flag.
In order to enable the caplin&#039;s Beacon API, the flag `--beacon.api=&lt;namespaces&gt;` must be added.
e.g: `--beacon.api=beacon,builder,config,debug,node,validator,lighthouse` will enable all endpoints. 
Note: enabling the Beacon API will lead to a 6 GB higher RAM usage

### Multiple Instances / One Machine

Define 6 flags to avoid conflicts: `--datadir --port --http.port --authrpc.port --torrent.port --private.api.addr`.
Example of multiple chains on the same machine:

```
# mainnet
./build/bin/erigon --datadir=&quot;&lt;your_mainnet_data_path&gt;&quot; --chain=mainnet --port=30303 --http.port=8545 --authrpc.port=8551 --torrent.port=42069 --private.api.addr=127.0.0.1:9090 --http --ws --http.api=eth,debug,net,trace,web3,erigon


# sepolia
./build/bin/erigon --datadir=&quot;&lt;your_sepolia_data_path&gt;&quot; --chain=sepolia --port=30304 --http.port=8546 --authrpc.port=8552 --torrent.port=42068 --private.api.addr=127.0.0.1:9091 --http --ws --http.api=eth,debug,net,trace,web3,erigon
```

Quote your path if it has spaces.

### Dev Chain

&lt;code&gt; 🔬 Detailed explanation is [DEV_CHAIN](/docs/DEV_CHAIN.md).&lt;/code&gt;

Key features
============

### Faster Initial Sync

On good network bandwidth EthereumMainnet FullNode syncs in 3
hours: [OtterSync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-3-alpha-2-introducing-blazingly) can sync

### More Efficient State Storage

**Flat KV storage.** Erigon uses a key-value database and storing accounts and storage in a simple way.

&lt;code&gt; 🔬 See our detailed DB walkthrough [here](./docs/programmers_guide/db_walkthrough.MD).&lt;/code&gt;

**Preprocessing**. For some operations, Erigon uses temporary files to preprocess data before inserting it into the main
DB. That reduces write amplification and DB inserts are orders of magnitude quicker.

**Single accounts/state trie**. Erigon uses a single Merkle trie for both accounts and the storage.

&lt;code&gt; 🔬 [Staged Sync Readme](/eth/stagedsync/README.md)&lt;/code&gt;

### JSON-RPC daemon

Most of Erigon&#039;s components (txpool, rpcdaemon, snapshots downloader, sentry, ...) can work inside Erigon and as
independent process on same Server (or another Server). Example:

```sh
make erigon rpcdaemon
./build/bin/erigon --datadir=/my --http=false
# To run RPCDaemon as separated process: use same `--datadir` as Erigon
./build/bin/rpcdaemon --datadir=/my --http.api=eth,erigon,web3,net,debug,trace,txpool --ws
```

- Supported JSON-RPC
  calls: [eth](./rpc/jsonrpc/eth_api.go), [debug](./rpc/jsonrpc/debug_api.go), [net](./rpc/jsonrpc/net_api.go), [web3](./rpc/jsonrpc/web3_api.go)
- increase throughput by: `--rpc.batch.concurrency`, `--rpc.batch.limit`, `--db.read.concurrency`
- increase throughput by disabling: `--http.compression`, `--ws.compression`

&lt;code&gt;🔬 See [RPC-Daemon docs](./cmd/rpcdaemon/README.md)&lt;/code&gt;

### Default Ports and Firewalls

#### `erigon` ports

| Component | Port  | Protocol  | Purpose                     | Should Expose |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| engine    | 9090  | TCP       | gRPC Server                 | Private       |
| engine    | 42069 | TCP &amp; UDP | Snap sync (Bittorrent)      | Public        |
| engine    | 8551  | TCP       | Engine API (JWT auth)       | Private       |
| sentry    | 30303 | TCP &amp; UDP | eth/68 peering              | Public        |
| sentry    | 30304 | TCP &amp; UDP | eth/67 peering              | Public        |
| sentry    | 9091  | TCP       | incoming gRPC Connections   | Private       |
| rpcdaemon | 8545  | TCP       | HTTP &amp; WebSockets &amp; GraphQL | Private       |

Typically, 30303 and 30304 are exposed to the internet to allow incoming peering connections. 9090 is exposed only
internally for rpcdaemon or other connections, (e.g. rpcdaemon -&gt; erigon).
Port 8551 (JWT authenticated) is exposed only internally for [Engine API] JSON-RPC queries from the Consensus Layer
node.

#### `caplin` ports

| Component | Port | Protocol | Purpose | Should Expose |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|---------------|
| sentinel  | 4000 | UDP

###### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/caarlos0/env/v11
```

###### Getting started

```go
type config struct {
  Home string `env:&quot;HOME&quot;`
}

// parse
var cfg config
err := env.Parse(&amp;cfg)

// parse with generics
cfg, err := env.ParseAs[config]()
```

You can see the full documentation and list of examples at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/caarlos0/env/v11).

  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Encore – the platform for building Go-based cloud backends.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Usage

### Caveats

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt;
&gt; _Unexported fields_ will be **ignored** by `env`.
&gt; This is by design and will not change.

### Functions

- `Parse`: parse the current environment into a type
- `ParseAs`: parse the current environment into a type using generics
- `ParseWithOptions`: parse the current environment into a type with custom options
- `ParseAsWithOptions`: parse the current environment into a type with custom options and using generics
- `Must`: can be used to wrap `Parse.*` calls to panic on error
- `GetFieldParams`: get the `env` parsed options for a type
- `GetFieldParamsWithOptions`: get the `env` parsed options for a type with custom options

### Supported types

Out of the box all built-in types are supported, plus a few others that are commonly used.

Complete list:

- `bool`
- `float32`
- `float64`
- `int16`
- `int32`
- `int64`
- `int8`
- `int`
- `string`
- `uint16`
- `uint32`
- `uint64`
- `uint8`
- `uint`
- `time.Duration`
- `time.Location`
- `encoding.TextUnmarshaler`
- `url.URL`

Pointers, slices and slices of pointers, and maps of those types are also supported.

You may also add custom parsers for your types.

### Tags

The following tags are provided:

- `env`: sets the environment variable name and optionally takes the tag options described below
- `envDefault`: sets the default value for the field
- `envPrefix`: can be used in a field that is a complex type to set a prefix to all environment variables used in it
- `envSeparator`: sets the character to be used to separate items in slices and maps (default: `,`)
- `envKeyValSeparator`: sets the character to be used to separate keys and their values in maps (default: `:`)

### `env` tag options

Here are all the options available for the `env` tag:

- `,expand`: expands environment variables, e.g. `FOO_${BAR}`
- `,file`: instructs that the content of the variable is a path to a file that should be read
- `,init`: initialize nil pointers
- `,notEmpty`: make the field errors if the environment variable is empty
- `,required`: make the field errors if the environment variable is not set
- `,unset`: unset the environment variable after use

### Parse Options

There are a few options available in the functions that end with `WithOptions`:

- `Environment`: keys and values to be used instead of `os.Environ()`
- `TagName`: specifies another tag name to use rather than the default `env`
- `PrefixTagName`: specifies another prefix tag name to use rather than the default `envPrefix`
- `DefaultValueTagName`: specifies another default tag name to use rather than the default `envDefault`
- `RequiredIfNoDef`: set all `env` fields as required if they do not declare `envDefault`
- `OnSet`: allows to hook into the `env` parsing and do something when a value is set
- `Prefix`: prefix to be used in all environment variables
- `UseFieldNameByDefault`: defines whether or not `env` should use the field name by default if the `env` key is missing
- `FuncMap`: custom parse functions for custom types

### Documentation and examples

Examples are live in [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/caarlos0/env/v11),
and also in the [example test file](./example_test.go).

## Current state

`env` is considered feature-complete.

I do not intent to add any new features unless they really make sense, and are
requested by many people.

Eventual bug fixes will keep being merged.

### 修改配置

首选建议通过修改环境变量方式进行修改。 例如增加deploy.yaml中的env参数


## 开发调试
如果你想在本地开发调试，请先执行一次本地前端构建，自动生成dist目录。因为本项目采用了二进制嵌入，没有dist前端会报错。
#### 第一步编译前端
```bash 
cd ui
pnpm run build
```

#### 编译调试后端
```bash
air
#或者
go run main.go 
# 监听localhost:3618端口
```

#### 前端热加载
```bash
cd ui
pnpm run dev
#Vite服务会监听在localhost:3000端口
#Vite转发后端访问到3618端口
```
访问http://localhost:3000

Gitleaks is a tool for **detecting** secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens in git repos, files, and whatever else you wanna throw at it via `stdin`. If you wanna learn more about how the detection engine works check out this blog: [Regex is (almost) all you need](https://lookingatcomputer.substack.com/p/regex-is-almost-all-you-need).

## Getting Started

Gitleaks can be installed using Homebrew, Docker, or Go. Gitleaks is also available in binary form for many popular platforms and OS types on the [releases page](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases). In addition, Gitleaks can be implemented as a pre-commit hook directly in your repo or as a GitHub action using [Gitleaks-Action](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action).

### Installing

```bash
# MacOS
brew install gitleaks

# Docker (DockerHub)
docker pull zricethezav/gitleaks:latest
docker run -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [SOURCE_PATH]

# Docker (ghcr.io)
docker pull ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:latest
docker run -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:latest [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [SOURCE_PATH]

# From Source (make sure `go` is installed)
git clone https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks.git
cd gitleaks
make build
```

### GitHub Action

Check out the official [Gitleaks GitHub Action](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action)

```
name: gitleaks
on: [pull_request, push, workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  scan:
    name: gitleaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITLEAKS_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.GITLEAKS_LICENSE}} # Only required for Organizations, not personal accounts.
```

### Pre-Commit

1. Install pre-commit from https://pre-commit.com/#install
2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of your repository with the following content:

   ```
   repos:
     - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
       rev: v8.24.2
       hooks:
         - id: gitleaks
   ```

   for a [native execution of gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases) or use the [`gitleaks-docker` pre-commit ID](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml) for executing gitleaks using the [official Docker images](#docker)

3. Auto-update the config to the latest repos&#039; versions by executing `pre-commit autoupdate`
4. Install with `pre-commit install`
5. Now you&#039;re all set!

```
➜ git commit -m &quot;this commit contains a secret&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets.................................................Failed
```

Note: to disable the gitleaks pre-commit hook you can prepend `SKIP=gitleaks` to the commit command
and it will skip running gitleaks

```
➜ SKIP=gitleaks git commit -m &quot;skip gitleaks check&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets................................................Skipped
```

### Commands

⚠️ v8.19.0 introduced a change that deprecated `detect` and `protect`. Those commands are still available but
are hidden in the `--help` menu. Take a look at this [gist](https://gist.github.com/zricethezav/b325bb93ebf41b9c0b0507acf12810d2) for easy command translations.
If you find v8.19.0 broke an existing command (`detect`/`protect`), please open an issue.

There are three scanning modes: `git`, `dir`, and `stdin`.

#### Git

The `git` command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, gitleaks uses the `git log -p` command to scan patches.
You can configure the behavior of `git log -p` with the `log-opts` option.
For example, if you wanted to run gitleaks on a range of commits you could use the following
command: `gitleaks git -v --log-opts=&quot;--all commitA..commitB&quot; path_to_repo`. See the [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) documentation for more information.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.

#### Dir

The `dir` (aliases include `files`, `directory`) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: `gitleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file`.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will scan the current working directory.

#### Stdin

You can also stream data to gitleaks with the `stdin` command. Example: `cat some_file | gitleaks -v stdin`

### Creating a baseline

When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline,
gitleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any gitleaks report. To create a gitleaks report, run gitleaks with the `--report-path` parameter.

```
gitleaks git --report-path gitleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called gitleaks-report.json
```

Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:

```
gitleaks git --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json
```

After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.

## Pre-Commit hook

You can run Gitleaks as a pre-commit hook by copying the example `pre-commit.py` script into
your `.git/hooks/` directory.

## Load Configuration

The order of precedence is:

1. `--config/-c` option:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git --config /home/dev/customgitleaks.toml .
      ```
2. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` with the file path:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG=&quot;/home/dev/customgitleaks.toml&quot;
      gitleaks git .
      ```
3. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` with the file content:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML=`cat customgitleaks.toml`
      gitleaks git .
      ```
4. A `.gitleaks.toml` file within the target path:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git .
      ```

If none of the four options are used, then gitleaks will use the default config.

## Configuration

Gitleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:

```toml
# Title for the gitleaks configuration file.
title = &quot;Custom Gitleaks configuration&quot;

# You have basically two options for your custom configuration:
#
# 1. define your own configuration, default rules do not apply
#
#    use e.g., the default configuration as starting point:
#    https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
#
# 2. extend a configuration, the rules are overwritten or extended
#
#    When you extend a configuration the extended rules take precedence over the
#    default rules. I.e., if there are duplicate rules in both the extended
#    configuration and the default configuration the extended rules or
#    attributes of them will override the default rules.
#    Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain
#    together multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are
#    appended and can contain duplicates.

# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the default gitleaks config built in to the binary
# the latest version is located at:
# https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can provide a path to a configuration to extend from.
# The path is relative to where gitleaks was invoked,
# not the location of the base config.

Refer to the default [gitleaks config](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml) for examples or follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to the default configuration. Additionally, you can check out [this gitleaks blog post](https://blog.gitleaks.io/stop-leaking-secrets-configuration-2-3-aeed293b1fbf) which covers advanced configuration setups.

### Additional Configuration

#### gitleaks:allow

If you are knowingly committing a test secret that gitleaks will catch you can add a `gitleaks:allow` comment to that line which will instruct gitleaks
to ignore that secret. Ex:

```
class CustomClass:
    discord_client_secret = &#039;8dyfuiRyq=vVc3RRr_edRk-fK__JItpZ&#039;  #gitleaks:allow

```

#### .gitleaksignore

You can ignore specific findings by creating a `.gitleaksignore` file at the root of your repo. In release v8.10.0 Gitleaks added a `Fingerprint` value to the Gitleaks report. Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret. Add this fingerprint to the `.gitleaksignore` file to ignore that specific secret. See Gitleaks&#039; [.gitleaksignore](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/.gitleaksignore) for an example. Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.

#### Decoding

Sometimes secrets are encoded in a way that can make them difficult to find
with just regex. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically find and decode
encoded text. The flag `--max-decode-depth` enables this feature (the default
value &quot;0&quot; means the feature is disabled by default).

Recursive decoding is supported since decoded text can also contain encoded
text.  The flag `--max-decode-depth` sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops
when there are no new segments of encoded text to decode, so setting a really
high max depth doesn&#039;t mean it will make that many passes. It will only make as
many as it needs to decode the text. Overall, decoding only minimally increases
scan times.

The findings for encoded text differ from normal findings in the following
ways:

- The location points the bounds of the encoded text
  - If the rule matches outside the encoded text, the bounds are adjusted to
    include that as well
- The match and secret contain the decoded value
- Two tags are added `decoded:&lt;encoding&gt;` and `decode-depth:&lt;depth&gt;`

Currently supported encodings:

- **percent** - Any printable ASCII percent encoded values
- **hex** - Any printable ASCII hex encoded values &gt;= 32 characters
- **base64** - Any printable ASCII base64 encoded values &gt;= 16 characters

#### Archive Scanning

Sometimes secrets are packaged within archive files like zip files or tarballs,
making them difficult to discover. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically
extract and scan the contents of archives. The flag `--max-archive-depth`
enables this feature for both `dir` and `git` scan types. The default value of
&quot;0&quot; means this feature is disabled by default.

Recursive scanning is supported since archives can also contain other archives.
The `--max-archive-depth` flag sets the

Gin is a web framework written in [Go](https://go.dev/). It features a martini-like API with performance that is up to 40 times faster thanks to [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).
If you need performance and good productivity, you will love Gin.

**Gin&#039;s key features are:**

- Zero allocation router
- Speed
- Middleware support
- Crash-free
- JSON validation
- Route grouping
- Error management
- Built-in rendering
- Extensible

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Gin requires [Go](https://go.dev/) version [1.23](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.23.0) or above.

### Getting Gin

With [Go&#039;s module support](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules), `go [build|run|test]` automatically fetches the necessary dependencies when you add the import in your code:

```sh
import &quot;github.com/gin-gonic/gin&quot;
```

Alternatively, use `go get`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

### Running Gin

A basic example:

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/gin-gonic/gin&quot;
)

func main() {
  r := gin.Default()
  r.GET(&quot;/ping&quot;, func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;pong&quot;,
    })
  })
  r.Run() // listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080 (for windows &quot;localhost:8080&quot;)
}
```

To run the code, use the `go run` command, like:

```sh
go run example.go
```

Then visit [`0.0.0.0:8080/ping`](http://0.0.0.0:8080/ping) in your browser to see the response!

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Diagram-as-code
This command line interface (CLI) tool enables drawing infrastructure diagrams for Amazon Web Services through YAML code. It facilitates diagram-as-code without relying on image libraries.

The CLI tool promotes code reuse, testing, integration, and automating the diagramming process. It allows managing diagrams with Git by writing human-readable YAML.

Example templates are [here](examples).
Check out the [Introduction Guide](doc/introduction.md) as well for additional information.

```

### for macOS user
```
$ brew install awsdac
```

## Usage

```
Usage:
  awsdac &lt;input filename&gt; [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --cfn-template               [beta] Create diagram from CloudFormation template
  -d, --dac-file                   [beta] Generate YAML file in dac (diagram-as-code) format from CloudFormation template
  -h, --help                       help for awsdac
  -o, --output string              Output file name (default &quot;output.png&quot;)

  -v, --verbose                    Enable verbose logging
      --version                    version for awsdac
```

### Example

```
$ awsdac examples/alb-ec2.yaml
```

```
$ awsdac privatelink.yaml -o custom-output.png
```

### [Beta] Create a diagram from CloudFormation template

`--cfn-template` option allows you to generate diagrams from CloudFormation templates, providing a visual representation of the resources.
The tool can generate diagrams even if the CloudFormation template is not in a perfect format, enabling you to visualize the resources before actually creating the CloudFormation stack. This means you don&#039;t have to strictly adhere to the CloudFormation syntax constraints.

&gt; **NOTE:** The functionality of generating diagrams from CloudFormation templates is currently in beta. It sometimes works correctly, but we are aware of several known issues where the tool might not produce accurate results. We are actively working on improving the tool and fixing these issues.

```
$ awsdac examples/vpc-subnet-ec2-cfn.yaml --cfn-template
```
(generated from [the example of VPC,Subnet,EC2](examples/vpc-subnet-ec2-cfn.yaml))

&lt;img src=&quot;examples/vpc-subnet-ec2-cfn.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

There are some patterns where the tool may not work as expected. You can find a list of known issues and their status on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/awslabs/diagram-as-code/labels/cfn-template%20feature).
Your feedback and issue reports are appreciated, as they will help enhance the tool&#039;s performance and accuracy.

#### Use &quot;--dac-file&quot; option

```
$ awsdac examples/vpc-subnet-ec2-cfn.yaml --cfn-template --dac-file
```
CloudFormation templates have various dependencies, and there is no simple parent-child relationship between resources. As a result, generating the desired diagram directly from the existing CloudFormation template formats can be challenging at this stage.
We considered utilizing Metadata or comments within the CloudFormation templates to include additional information. However, this approach would make the templates excessively long, and CloudFormation templates are primarily intended for resource creation and management rather than diagram generation. Additionally, combining different lifecycle components into a single CloudFormation template could make it difficult to manage and maintain.

Therefore, instead of directly generating diagrams from CloudFormation templates, you can create a separate YAML file from CloudFormation template and customize this YAML file.
This customized YAML file can then be used as input for `awsdac` to generate the desired architecture diagrams. By decoupling the diagram generation process from the CloudFormation template structure, this approach offers greater flexibility and customization while leveraging the specialized strengths of `awsdac`.
```
CloudFormation template --[awsdac]--&gt; yaml file in awsdac format --[user custom]--&gt; your desired diagram :)
```

## Features

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MCP Toolbox for Databases is currently in beta, and may see breaking
&gt; changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

MCP Toolbox for Databases is an open source MCP server for databases. It enables
you to develop tools easier, faster, and more securely by handling the complexities
such as connection pooling, authentication, and more.

This README provides a brief overview. For comprehensive details, see the [full
documentation](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/).


&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This solution was originally named “Gen AI Toolbox for Databases” as
&gt; its initial development predated MCP, but was renamed to align with recently
&gt; added MCP compatibility.

## Getting Started

### Installing the server
For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases] and use the
following instructions for your OS and CPU architecture.

[releases]: https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox/releases

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Binary&lt;/summary&gt;

To install Toolbox as a binary:

&lt;!-- {x-release-please-start-version} --&gt;
```sh
# see releases page for other versions
export VERSION=0.7.0
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/linux/amd64/toolbox
chmod +x toolbox
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Container image&lt;/summary&gt;
You can also install Toolbox as a container:

```sh
# see releases page for other versions
export VERSION=0.7.0
docker pull us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:$VERSION
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Compile from source&lt;/summary&gt;

To install from source, ensure you have the latest version of
[Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), and then run the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox@v0.7.0
```
&lt;!-- {x-release-please-end} --&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

### Running the server

[Configure](#configuration) a `tools.yaml` to define your tools, and then
execute `toolbox` to start the server:

```sh
./toolbox --tools-file &quot;tools.yaml&quot;
```

You can use `toolbox help` for a full list of flags! To stop the server, send a
terminate signal (`ctrl+c` on most platforms).

For more detailed documentation on deploying to different environments, check
out the resources in the [How-to
section](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/how-to/)

### Integrating your application

Once your server is up and running, you can load the tools into your
application. See below the list of Client SDKs for using various frameworks:

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Core&lt;/summary&gt;

1. Install [Toolbox Core SDK][toolbox-core]:
    ```bash
    pip install toolbox-core
    ```
1. Load tools:
    ```python
    from toolbox_core import ToolboxClient

    # update the url to point to your server
    async with ToolboxClient(&quot;http://127.0.0.1:5000&quot;) as client:

        # these tools can be passed to your application!
        tools = await client.load_toolset(&quot;toolset_name&quot;)
    ```

For more detailed instructions on using the Toolbox Core SDK, see the
[project&#039;s README][toolbox-core-readme].

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;LangChain / LangGraph&lt;/summary&gt;

1. Install [Toolbox LangChain SDK][toolbox-langchain]:
    ```bash
    pip install toolbox-langchain
    ```
1. Load tools:
    ```python
    from toolbox_langchain import ToolboxClient

    # update the url to point to your server
    async with ToolboxClient(&quot;http://127.0.0.1:5000&quot;) as client:

        # these tools can be passed to your application!
        tools = client.load_toolset()
    ```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;LlamaIndex&lt;/summary&gt;

1. Install [Toolbox Llamaindex SDK][toolbox-llamaindex]:
    ```bash
    pip install toolbox-llamaindex
    ```
1. Load tools:
    ```python
    from toolbox_llamaindex import ToolboxClient

    # update the url to point to your server
    async with ToolboxClient(&quot;http://127.0.0.1:5000&quot;) as client:

        # these tools can be passed to your application!
        tools = client.load_toolset()
    ```

For more detailed instructions on using the Toolbox Llamaindex SDK, see the
[project&#039;s README][toolbox-llamaindex-readme].

[toolbox-llamaindex]: https://pypi.org/project/toolbox-llamaindex/
[toolbox-llamaindex-readme]: https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox-llamaindex-python/blob/main/README.md

&lt;/details&gt;

## Configuration

The primary way to configure Toolbox is through the `tools.yaml` file. If you
have multiple files, you can tell toolbox which to load with the `--tools-file
tools.yaml` flag.

You can find more detailed reference documentation to all resource types in the
[Resources](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/resources/).
### Sources

The `sources` section of your `tools.yaml` defines what data sources your
Toolbox should have access to. Most tools will have at least one source to
execute against.

```yaml
sources:
  my-pg-source:
    kind: postgres
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
    database: toolbox_db
    user: toolbox_user
    password: my-password
```

For more details on configuring different types of sources, see the
[Sources](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/resources/sources).

### Tools

The `tools` section of a `tools.yaml` define the actions an agent can take: what
kind of tool it is, which source(s) it affects, what parameters it uses, etc.

```yaml
tools:
  search-hotels-by-name:
    kind: postgres-sql
    source: my-pg-source
    description: Search for hotels based on name.
    parameters:
      - name: name
        type: string
        description: The name of the hotel.
    statement: SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name ILIKE &#039;%&#039; || $1 || &#039;%&#039;;
```

For more details on configuring different types of tools, see the
[Tools](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/resources/tools).


### Toolsets

The `toolsets` section of your `tools.yaml` allows you to define groups of tools
that you want to be able to load together. This can be useful for defining
different groups based on agent or application.

```yaml
toolsets:
    my_first_toolset:
        - my_first_tool
        - my_second_tool
    my_second_toolset:
        - my_second_tool
        - my_third_tool
```

You can load toolsets by name:

```python
# This will load all tools
all_tools = client.load_toolset()

# This will only load the tools listed in &#039;my_second_toolset&#039;
my_second_toolset = client.load_toolset(&quot;my_second_toolset&quot;)
```

## Versioning

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), including a
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version number that increments with:

- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when we add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when we make backward compatible bug fixes

The public API that this applies to is the CLI associated with Toolbox, the
interactions with official SDKs, and the definitions in the `tools.yaml` file.

OpenTelemetry-Go is the [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
It provides a set of APIs to directly measure performance and behavior of your software and send this data to observability platforms.

## Project Status

| Signal  | Status             |
|---------|--------------------|
| Traces  | Stable             |
| Metrics | Stable             |
| Logs    | Beta[^1]           |

Progress and status specific to this repository is tracked in our
[project boards](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/projects)
and
[milestones](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/milestones).

Project versioning information and stability guarantees can be found in the
[versioning documentation](VERSIONING.md).

[^1]: https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects/43

### Compatibility

OpenTelemetry-Go ensures compatibility with the current supported versions of
the [Go language](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy):

&gt; Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
&gt; For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release.

For versions of Go that are no longer supported upstream, opentelemetry-go will
stop ensuring compatibility with these versions in the following manner:

- A minor release of opentelemetry-go will be made to add support for the new
  supported release of Go.
- The following minor release of opentelemetry-go will remove compatibility
  testing for the oldest (now archived upstream) version of Go. This, and
  future, releases of opentelemetry-go may include features only supported by
  the currently supported versions of Go.

Currently, this project supports the following environments.

| OS       | Go Version | Architecture |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | arm64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | arm64        |
| macOS 13 | 1.24       | amd64        |
| macOS 13 | 1.23       | amd64        |
| macOS    | 1.24       | arm64        |
| macOS    | 1.23       | arm64        |
| Windows  | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Windows  | 1.23       | amd64        |
| Windows  | 1.24       | 386          |
| Windows  | 1.23       | 386          |

While this project should work for other systems, no compatibility guarantees
are made for those systems currently.

## Getting Started

You can find a getting started guide on [opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/getting-started/).

OpenTelemetry&#039;s goal is to provide a single set of APIs to capture distributed
traces and metrics from your application and send them to an observability
platform. This project allows you to do just that for applications written in
Go. There are two steps to this process: instrument your application, and
configure an exporter.

### Instrumentation

To start capturing distributed traces and metric events from your application
it first needs to be instrumented. The easiest way to do this is by using an
instrumentation library for your code. Be sure to check out [the officially
supported instrumentation
libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

If you need to extend the telemetry an instrumentation library provides or want
to build your own instrumentation for your application directly you will need
to use the
[Go otel](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel)
package. The [examples](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/examples)
are a good way to see some practical uses of this process.

### Export

Now that your application is instrumented to collect telemetry, it needs an
export pipeline to send that telemetry to an observability platform.

All officially supported exporters for the OpenTelemetry project are contained in the [exporters directory](./exporters).

| Exporter                              | Logs | Metrics | Traces |
|---------------------------------------|:----:|:-------:|:------:|
| [OTLP](./exporters/otlp/)             |  ✓   |    ✓    |   ✓    |
| [Prometheus](./exporters/prometheus/) |      |    ✓    |        |
| [stdout](./exporters/stdout/)         |  ✓   |    ✓    |   ✓    |
| [Zipkin](./exporters/zipkin/)         |      |         |   ✓    |

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

## Development Status

frp is currently under development. You can try the latest release version in the `master` branch, or use the `dev` branch to access the version currently in development.

We are currently working on version 2 and attempting to perform some code refactoring and improvements. However, please note that it will not be compatible with version 1.

We will transition from version 0 to version 1 at the appropriate time and will only accept bug fixes and improvements, rather than big feature requests.

### About V2

The complexity and difficulty of the v2 version are much higher than anticipated. I can only work on its development during fragmented time periods, and the constant interruptions disrupt productivity significantly. Given this situation, we will continue to optimize and iterate on the current version until we have more free time to proceed with the major version overhaul.

The concept behind v2 is based on my years of experience and reflection in the cloud-native domain, particularly in K8s and ServiceMesh. Its core is a modernized four-layer and seven-layer proxy, similar to envoy. This proxy itself is highly scalable, not only capable of implementing the functionality of intranet penetration but also applicable to various other domains. Building upon this highly scalable core, we aim to implement all the capabilities of frp v1 while also addressing the functionalities that were previously unachievable or difficult to implement in an elegant manner. Furthermore, we will maintain efficient development and iteration capabilities.

In addition, I envision frp itself becoming a highly extensible system and platform, similar to how we can provide a range of extension capabilities based on K8s. In K8s, we can customize development according to enterprise needs, utilizing features such as CRD, controller mode, webhook, CSI, and CNI. In frp v1, we introduced the concept of server plugins, which implemented some basic extensibility. However, it relies on a simple HTTP protocol and requires users to start independent processes and manage them on their own. This approach is far from flexible and convenient, and real-world demands vary greatly. It is unrealistic to expect a non-profit open-source project maintained by a few individuals to meet everyone&#039;s needs.

Finally, we acknowledge that the current design of modules such as configuration management, permission verification, certificate management, and API management is not modern enough. While we may carry out some optimizations in the v1 version, ensuring compatibility remains a challenging issue that requires a considerable amount of effort to address.

We sincerely appreciate your support for frp.

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

To begin, download the latest program for your operating system and architecture from the [Release](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases) page.

Next, place the `frps` binary and server configuration file on Server A, which has a public IP address.

Finally, place the `frpc` binary and client configuration file on Server B, which is located on a LAN that cannot be directly accessed from the public internet.

Some antiviruses improperly mark frpc as malware and delete it. This is due to frp being a networking tool capable of creating reverse proxies. Antiviruses sometimes flag reverse proxies due to their ability to bypass firewall port restrictions. If you are using antivirus, then you may need to whitelist/exclude frpc in your antivirus settings to avoid accidental quarantine/deletion. See [issue 3637](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/issues/3637) for more details.

### Access your computer in a LAN network via SSH

1. Modify `frps.toml` on server A by setting the `bindPort` for frp clients to connect to:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps` on server A:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` on server B and set the `serverAddr` field to the public IP address of your frps server:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

Note that the `localPort` (listened on the client) and `remotePort` (exposed on the server) are used for traffic going in and out of the frp system, while the `serverPort` is used for communication between frps and frpc.

4. Start `frpc` on server B:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. To access server B from another machine through server A via SSH (assuming the username is `test`), use the following command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Multiple SSH services sharing the same port

This example implements multiple SSH services exposed through the same port using a proxy of type tcpmux. Similarly, as long as the client supports the HTTP Connect proxy connection method, port reuse can be achieved in this way.

1. Deploy frps on a machine with a public IP and modify the frps.toml file. Here is a simplified configuration:

  ```toml
  bindPort = 7000
  tcpmuxHTTPConnectPort = 5002
  ```

2. Deploy frpc on the internal machine A with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh1&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-a.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

3. Deploy another frpc on the internal machine B with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;ssh2&quot;
  type = &quot;tcpmux&quot;
  multiplexer = &quot;httpconnect&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;machine-b.example.com&quot;]
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

4. To access internal machine A using SSH ProxyCommand, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-a.example.com`

5. To access internal machine B, the only difference is the domain name, assuming the username is &quot;test&quot;:

  `ssh -o &#039;proxycommand socat - PROXY:x.x.x.x:%h:%p,proxyport=5002&#039; test@machine-b.example.com`

### Accessing Internal Web Services with Custom Domains in LAN

Sometimes we need to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing purposes with our own domain name.

Unfortunately, we cannot resolve a domain name to a local IP. However, we can use frp to expose an HTTP(S) service.

1. Modify `frps.toml` and set the HTTP port for vhost to 8080:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  vhostHTTPPort = 8080
  ```

  If you want to configure an https proxy, you need to set up the `vhostHTTPSPort`.

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Specify the `localPort` of your web service:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;web&quot;
  type = &quot;http&quot;
  localPort = 80
  customDomains = [&quot;www.example.com&quot;]
  ```

4. Start `frpc`:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Map the A record of `www.example.com` to either the public IP of the remote frps server or a CNAME record pointing to your original domain.

6. Visit your local web service using url `http://www.example.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query requests

1. Modify `frps.toml`:

  ```toml
  # frps.toml
  bindPort = 7000
  ```

2. Start `frps`:

  `./frps -c ./frps.toml`

3. Modify `frpc.toml` and set `serverAddr` to the IP address of the remote frps server. Forward DNS query requests to the Google Public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;dns&quot;
  type = &quot;udp&quot;
  localIP = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;
  localPort = 53
  remotePort = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.toml`

5. Test DNS resolution using the `dig` command:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com`

### Forward Unix Domain Socket

Expose a Unix domain socket (e.g. the Docker daemon socket) as TCP.

Configure `frps` as above.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;
  unixPath = &quot;/var/run/docker.sock&quot;
  ```

2. Test the configuration by getting the docker version using `curl`:

  `curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version`

### Expose a simple HTTP file server

Expose a simple HTTP file server to access files stored in the LAN from the public Internet.

Configure `frps` as described above, then:

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_static_file&quot;
  type = &quot;tcp&quot;
  remotePort = 6000
  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;static_file&quot;
  localPath = &quot;/tmp/files&quot;
  stripPrefix = &quot;static&quot;
  httpUser = &quot;abc&quot;
  httpPassword = &quot;abc&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/` from your browser and specify correct username and password to view files in `/tmp/files` on the `frpc` machine.

### Enable HTTPS for a local HTTP(S) service

You may substitute `https2https` for the plugin, and point the `localAddr` to a HTTPS endpoint.

1. Start `frpc` with the following configuration:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;test_https2http&quot;
  type = &quot;https&quot;
  customDomains = [&quot;test.example.com&quot;]

  [proxies.plugin]
  type = &quot;https2http&quot;
  localAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:80&quot;
  crtPath = &quot;./server.crt&quot;
  keyPath = &quot;./server.key&quot;
  hostHeaderRewrite = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  requestHeaders.set.x-from-where = &quot;frp&quot;
  ```

2. Visit `https://test.example.com`.

### Expose your service privately

To mitigate risks associated with exposing certain services directly to the public network, STCP (Secret TCP) mode requires a preshared key to be used for access to the service from other clients.

Configure `frps` same as above.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B with the following config. This example is for exposing the SSH service (port 22), and note the `secretKey` field for the preshared key, and that the `remotePort` field is removed here:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the following config to access the SSH service with a security key (`secretKey` field):

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;secret_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;stcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;secret_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

### P2P Mode

**xtcp** is designed to transmit large amounts of data directly between clients. A frps server is still needed, as P2P here only refers to the actual data transmission.

Note that it may not work with all types of NAT devices. You might want to fallback to stcp if xtcp doesn&#039;t work.

1. Start `frpc` on machine B, and expose the SSH port. Note that the `remotePort` field is removed:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[proxies]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  localPort = 22
  ```

2. Start another `frpc` (typically on another machine C) with the configuration to connect to SSH using P2P mode:

  ```toml
  # frpc.toml
  serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
  serverPort = 7000
  # set up a new stun server if the default one is not available.
  # natHoleStunServer = &quot;xxx&quot;

  [[visitors]]
  name = &quot;p2p_ssh_visitor&quot;
  type = &quot;xtcp&quot;
  serverName = &quot;p2p_ssh&quot;
  secretKey = &quot;abcdefg&quot;
  bindAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
  bindPort = 6000
  # when automatic tunnel persistence is required, set it to true
  keepTunnelOpen = false
  ```

3. On machine C, connect to SSH on machine B, using this command:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 127.0.0.1`

## Features

### Configuration Files

Since v0.52.0, we support TOML, YAML, and JSON for configuration. Please note that INI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. New features will only be available in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Users wanting these new features should switch their configuration format accordingly.

Read the full example configuration files to find out even more features not described here.

Examples use TOML format, but you can still use YAML or JSON.

These configuration files is for reference only. Please do not use this configuration directly to run the program as it may have various issues.

[Full configuration file for frps (Server)](./conf/frps_full_example.toml)

[Full configuration file for frpc (Client)](./conf/frpc_full_example.toml)

### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be referenced in the configuration file, using Go&#039;s standard format:

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}&quot;
serverPort = 7000

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = &quot;{{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}&quot;
```

With the config above, variables can be passed into `frpc` program like this:

```
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=x.x.x.x
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=6000
./frpc -c ./frpc.toml
```

`frpc` will render configuration file template using OS environment variables. Remember to prefix your reference with `.Envs`.

### Split Configures Into Different Files

You can split multiple proxy configs into different files and include them in the main file.

```toml
# frpc.toml
serverAddr = &quot;x.x.x.x&quot;
serverPort = 7000
includes = [&quot;./confd/*.toml&quot;]
```

```toml
# ./confd/test.toml

[[proxies]]
name = &quot;ssh&quot;
type = &quot;tcp&quot;
localIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
localPort = 22
remotePort = 6000
```

### Server Dashboard

Check frp&#039;s status and proxies&#039; statistics information by Dashboard.

Configure a port for dashboard to enable this feature:

```toml
# The default value is 127.0.0.1. Change it to 0.0.0.0 when you want to access it from a public network.
webServer.addr = &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;
webServer.port = 7500
# dashboard&#039;s username and password are both optional
webServer.user = &quot;admin&quot;
webServer.password = &quot;admin&quot;
```

Then visit `http://[serverAddr]:7500` to see the dashboard, with username and password both being `admin`.

Additionally, you can use HTTPS port by using your domains wildcard or normal SSL certificate:

```toml
webServer.port = 7500
# dashboard&#039;s username and password are both optional
webSe

Alternatively you can run the docker image:
```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code ghcr.io/swaggo/swag:latest
```

Or download a pre-compiled binary from the [release page](https://github.com/swaggo/swag/releases).

3. Run `swag init` in the project&#039;s root folder which contains the `main.go` file. This will parse your comments and generate the required files (`docs` folder and `docs/docs.go`).
```sh
swag init
```

  Make sure to import the generated `docs/docs.go` so that your specific configuration gets `init`&#039;ed. If your General API annotations do not live in `main.go`, you can let swag know with `-g` flag.
  ```go
  import _ &quot;example-module-name/docs&quot;
  ```
  ```sh
  swag init -g http/api.go
  ```

4. (optional) Use `swag fmt` format the SWAG comment. (Please upgrade to the latest version)

  ```sh
  swag fmt
  ```

## How to use it with Gin

Find the example source code [here](https://github.com/swaggo/swag/tree/master/example/celler).

Finish the steps in [Getting started](#getting-started)
1. After using `swag init` to generate Swagger 2.0 docs, import the following packages:
```go
import &quot;github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger&quot; // gin-swagger middleware
import &quot;github.com/swaggo/files&quot; // swagger embed files
```

2. Add [General API](#general-api-info) annotations in `main.go` code:

```go
// @title           Swagger Example API
// @version         1.0
// @description     This is a sample server celler server.
// @termsOfService  http://swagger.io/terms/

// @contact.name   API Support
// @contact.url    http://www.swagger.io/support
// @contact.email  support@swagger.io

// @license.name  Apache 2.0
// @license.url   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html

// @host      localhost:8080
// @BasePath  /api/v1

// @securityDefinitions.basic  BasicAuth

// @externalDocs.description  OpenAPI
// @externalDocs.url          https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/
func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	c := controller.NewController()

	v1 := r.Group(&quot;/api/v1&quot;)
	{
		accounts := v1.Group(&quot;/accounts&quot;)
		{
			accounts.GET(&quot;:id&quot;, c.ShowAccount)
			accounts.GET(&quot;&quot;, c.ListAccounts)
			accounts.POST(&quot;&quot;, c.AddAccount)
			accounts.DELETE(&quot;:id&quot;, c.DeleteAccount)
			accounts.PATCH(&quot;:id&quot;, c.UpdateAccount)
			accounts.POST(&quot;:id/images&quot;, c.UploadAccountImage)
		}
    //...
	}
	r.GET(&quot;/swagger/*any&quot;, ginSwagger.WrapHandler(swaggerFiles.Handler))
	r.Run(&quot;:8080&quot;)
}
//...
```

Additionally some general API info can be set dynamically. The generated code package `docs` exports `SwaggerInfo` variable which we can use to set the title, description, version, host and base path programmatically. Example using Gin:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;github.com/gin-gonic/gin&quot;
	&quot;github.com/swaggo/files&quot;
	&quot;github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger&quot;

	&quot;./docs&quot; // docs is generated by Swag CLI, you have to import it.
)

// @contact.name   API Support
// @contact.url    http://www.swagger.io/support
// @contact.email  support@swagger.io

// @license.name  Apache 2.0
// @license.url   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
func main() {

	// programmatically set swagger info
	docs.SwaggerInfo.Title = &quot;Swagger Example API&quot;
	docs.SwaggerInfo.Description = &quot;This is a sample server Petstore server.&quot;
	docs.SwaggerInfo.Version = &quot;1.0&quot;
	docs.SwaggerInfo.Host = &quot;petstore.swagger.io&quot;
	docs.SwaggerInfo.BasePath = &quot;/v2&quot;
	docs.SwaggerInfo.Schemes = []string{&quot;http&quot;, &quot;https&quot;}

	r := gin.New()

	// use ginSwagger middleware to serve the API docs
	r.GET(&quot;/swagger/*any&quot;, ginSwagger.WrapHandler(swaggerFiles.Handler))

	r.Run()
}
```

3. Add [API Operation](#api-operation) annotations in `controller` code

``` go
package controller

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;net/http&quot;
    &quot;strconv&quot;

    &quot;github.com/gin-gonic/gin&quot;
    &quot;github.com/swaggo/swag/example/celler/httputil&quot;
    &quot;github.com/swaggo/swag/example/celler/model&quot;
)

// ShowAccount godoc
// @Summary      Show an account
// @Description  get string by ID
// @Tags         accounts
// @Accept       json
// @Produce      json
// @Param        id   path      int  true  &quot;Account ID&quot;
// @Success      200  {object}  model.Account
// @Failure      400  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
// @Failure      404  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
// @Failure      500  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
// @Router       /accounts/{id} [get]
func (c *Controller) ShowAccount(ctx *gin.Context) {
  id := ctx.Param(&quot;id&quot;)
  aid, err := strconv.Atoi(id)
  if err != nil {
    httputil.NewError(ctx, http.StatusBadRequest, err)
    return
  }
  account, err := model.AccountOne(aid)
  if err != nil {
    httputil.NewError(ctx, http.StatusNotFound, err)
    return
  }
  ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK, account)
}

// ListAccounts godoc
// @Summary      List accounts
// @Description  get accounts
// @Tags         accounts
// @Accept       json
// @Produce      json
// @Param        q    query     string  false  &quot;name search by q&quot;  Format(email)
// @Success      200  {array}   model.Account
// @Failure      400  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
// @Failure      404  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
// @Failure      500  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
// @Router       /accounts [get]
func (c *Controller) ListAccounts(ctx *gin.Context) {
  q := ctx.Request.URL.Query().Get(&quot;q&quot;)
  accounts, err := model.AccountsAll(q)
  if err != nil {
    httputil.NewError(ctx, http.StatusNotFound, err)
    return
  }
  ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK, accounts)
}
//...
```

```console
swag init
```

4. Run your app, and browse to http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html. You will see Swagger 2.0 Api documents as shown below:

![swagger_index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swaggo/swag/master/assets/swagger-image.png)

## The swag formatter

The Swag Comments can be automatically formatted, just like &#039;go fmt&#039;.
Find the result of formatting [here](https://github.com/swaggo/swag/tree/master/example/celler).

Usage:
```shell
swag fmt
```

Exclude folder：
```shell
swag fmt -d ./ --exclude ./internal
```

When using `swag fmt`, you need to ensure that you have a doc comment for the function to ensure correct formatting.
This is due to `swag fmt` indenting swag comments with tabs, which is only allowed *after* a standard doc comment.

For example, use

```go
// ListAccounts lists all existing accounts
//
//  @Summary      List accounts
//  @Description  get accounts
//  @Tags         accounts
//  @Accept       json
//  @Produce      json
//  @Param        q    query     string  false  &quot;name search by q&quot;  Format(email)
//  @Success      200  {array}   model.Account
//  @Failure      400  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
//  @Failure      404  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
//  @Failure      500  {object}  httputil.HTTPError
//  @Router       /accounts [get]
func (c *Controller) ListAccounts(ctx *gin.Context) {
```

| tag.name    | Name of a tag.| // @tag.name This is the name of the tag                     |
| tag.description.markdown   | Description of the tag this is an alternative to tag.description. The description will be read from a file named like tagname.md  | // @tag.description.markdown         |
| tag.x-name  | The extension key, must be start by x- and take only string value | // @x-example-key value |


## API Operation

**Example**
[celler/controller](https://github.com/swaggo/swag/tree/master/example/celler/controller)


| annotation           | description

## 🔨 Installation

For binary builds, Docker images, RPM &amp; DEB packages, and other builds of
Telegraf, please see the [install guide](/docs/INSTALL_GUIDE.md).

See the [releases documentation](/docs/RELEASES.md) for details on versioning
and when releases are made.

## 💻 Usage

Users define a TOML configuration with the plugins and settings they wish to
use, then pass that configuration to Telegraf. The Telegraf agent then
collects data from inputs at each interval and sends data to outputs at each
flush interval.

For a basic walkthrough see [quick start](/docs/QUICK_START.md).

## 📖 Documentation

For a full list of documentation including tutorials, reference and other
material, start with the [/docs directory](/docs/README.md).

Additionally, each plugin has its own README that includes details about how to
configure, use, and sometimes debug or troubleshoot. Look under the
[/plugins directory](/plugins/) for specific plugins.

Here are some commonly used documents:

* [Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md)
* [Configuration](/docs/CONFIGURATION.md)
* [FAQ](/docs/FAQ.md)

Lightweight Kubernetes.  Production ready, easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary less than 100 MB.

Great for:

* Edge
* IoT
* CI
* Development
* ARM
* Embedding k8s
* Situations where a PhD in k8s clusterology is infeasible

What is this?
---

K3s is a [fully conformant](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pulls?q=is%3Apr+k3s) production-ready Kubernetes distribution with the following changes:

1. It is packaged as a single binary.
1. It adds support for sqlite3 as the default storage backend. Etcd3, MariaDB, MySQL, and Postgres are also supported.
1. It wraps Kubernetes and other components in a single, simple launcher.
1. It is secure by default with reasonable defaults for lightweight environments.
1. It has minimal to no OS dependencies (just a sane kernel and cgroup mounts needed).
1. It eliminates the need to expose a port on Kubernetes worker nodes for the kubelet API by exposing this API to the Kubernetes control plane nodes over a websocket tunnel.

K3s bundles the following technologies together into a single cohesive distribution:

* [Containerd](https://containerd.io/) &amp; [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)
* [Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) for CNI
* [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/)
* [Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)
* [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) for ingress
* [Klipper-lb](https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb) as an embedded service load balancer provider
* [Kube-router](https://www.kube-router.io/) netpol controller for network policy
* [Helm-controller](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller) to allow for CRD-driven deployment of helm manifests
* [Kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine) as a datastore shim that allows etcd to be replaced with other databases
* [Local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) for provisioning volumes using local storage
* [Host utilities](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-root) such as iptables/nftables, ebtables, ethtool, &amp; socat

These technologies can be disabled or swapped out for technologies of your choice.

Additionally, K3s simplifies Kubernetes operations by maintaining functionality for:

* Managing the TLS certificates of Kubernetes components
* Managing the connection between worker and server nodes
* Auto-deploying Kubernetes resources from local manifests in realtime as they are changed.
* Managing an embedded etcd cluster

What&#039;s with the name?
--------------------

We wanted an installation of Kubernetes that was half the size in terms of memory footprint. Kubernetes is a
10 letter word stylized as k8s. So something half as big as Kubernetes would be a 5 letter word stylized as
K3s. A &#039;3&#039; is also an &#039;8&#039; cut in half vertically. There is neither a long-form of K3s nor official pronunciation.

Is this a fork?
---------------

No, it&#039;s a distribution. A fork implies continued divergence from the original. This is not K3s&#039;s goal or practice. K3s explicitly intends not to change any core Kubernetes functionality. We seek to remain as close to upstream Kubernetes as possible. However, we maintain a small set of patches (well under 1000 lines) important to K3s&#039;s use case and deployment model. We maintain patches for other components as well. When possible, we contribute these changes back to the upstream projects, for example, with [SELinux support in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/cri/pull/1487/commits/24209b91bf361e131478d15cfea1ab05694dc3eb). This is a common practice amongst software distributions.

K3s is a distribution because it packages additional components and services necessary for a fully functional cluster that go beyond vanilla Kubernetes. These are opinionated choices on technologies for components like ingress, storage class, network policy, service load balancer, and even container runtime. These choices and technologies are touched on in more detail in the [What is this?](#what-is-this) section.

How is this lightweight or smaller than upstream Kubernetes?
---

There are two major ways that K3s is lighter weight than upstream Kubernetes:
1. The memory footprint to run it is smaller
2. The binary, which contains all the non-containerized components needed to run a cluster, is smaller

The memory footprint is reduced primarily by running many components inside of a single process. This eliminates significant overhead that would otherwise be duplicated for each component.

The binary is smaller by removing third-party storage drivers and cloud providers, explained in more detail below.

What have you removed from upstream Kubernetes?
---

This is a common point of confusion because it has changed over time. Early versions of K3s had much more removed than the current version. K3s currently removes two things:

1. In-tree storage drivers
1. In-tree cloud provider

Both of these have out-of-tree alternatives in the form of [CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) and [CCM](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/), which work in K3s and which upstream is moving towards.

We remove these to achieve a smaller binary size. They can be removed while remaining conformant because neither affects core Kubernetes functionality. They are also dependent on third-party cloud or data center technologies/services, which may not be available in many K3s&#039; use cases.

What&#039;s next?

Check out our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see what we have planned moving forward.

Release cadence
---

K3s maintains pace with upstream Kubernetes releases. Our goal is to release patch releases within one week, and new minors within 30 days.

Our release versioning reflects the version of upstream Kubernetes that is being released. For example, the K3s release [v1.27.4+k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/tag/v1.27.4%2Bk3s1) maps to the `v1.27.4` Kubernetes release. We add a postfix in the form of `+k3s&lt;number&gt;` to allow us to make additional releases using the same version of upstream Kubernetes while remaining [semver](https://semver.org/) compliant. For example, if we discovered a high severity bug in `v1.27.4+k3s1` and needed to release an immediate fix for it, we would release `v1.27.4+k3s2`.

Documentation
-------------

Please see [the official docs site](https://docs.k3s.io) for complete documentation.

Quick-Start - Install Script
--------------

The `install.sh` script provides a convenient way to download K3s and add a service to systemd or openrc.

To install k3s as a service, run:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

A kubeconfig file is written to `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` and the service is automatically started or restarted.
The install script will install K3s and additional utilities, such as `kubectl`, `crictl`, `k3s-killall.sh`, and `k3s-uninstall.sh`, for example:

```bash
sudo kubectl get nodes
```

`K3S_TOKEN` is created at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` on your server.
To install on worker nodes, pass `K3S_URL` along with
`K3S_TOKEN` environment variables, for example:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=XXX sh -
```

Manual Download
---------------

1. Download `k3s` from latest [release](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/latest), x86_64, armhf, arm64 and s390x are supported.
1. Run the server.

```bash
sudo k3s server &amp;
# Kubeconfig is written to /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
sudo k3s kubectl get nodes

# On a different node run the below. NODE_TOKEN comes from
# /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token on your server
sudo k3s agent --server https://myserver:6443 --token ${NODE_TOKEN}
```

* Tutorials: [HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials)
* Forum: [Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/nomad)

Nomad provides several key features:

* **Deploy Containers and Legacy Applications**: Nomad’s flexibility as an orchestrator enables an organization to run containers, legacy, and batch applications together on the same infrastructure.  Nomad brings core orchestration benefits to legacy applications without needing to containerize via pluggable task drivers.

* **Simple &amp; Reliable**:  Nomad runs as a single binary and is entirely self contained - combining resource management and scheduling into a single system.  Nomad does not require any external services for storage or coordination.  Nomad automatically handles application, node, and driver failures.  Nomad is distributed and resilient, using leader election and state replication to provide high availability in the event of failures.

* **Device Plugins &amp; GPU Support**: Nomad offers built-in support for GPU workloads such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).  Nomad uses device plugins to automatically detect and utilize resources from hardware devices such as GPU, FPGAs, and TPUs.

* **Federation for Multi-Region, Multi-Cloud**: Nomad was designed to support infrastructure at a global scale.  Nomad supports federation out-of-the-box and can deploy applications across multiple regions and clouds.

* **Proven Scalability**: Nomad is optimistically concurrent, which increases throughput and reduces latency for workloads.  Nomad has been proven to scale to clusters of 10K+ nodes in real-world production environments.

* **HashiCorp Ecosystem**: Nomad integrates seamlessly with Terraform, Consul, Vault for provisioning, service discovery, and secrets management.

# What is TruffleHog 🐽

TruffleHog is the most powerful secrets **Discovery, Classification, Validation,** and **Analysis** tool. In this context secret refers to a credential a machine uses to authenticate itself to another machine. This includes API keys, database passwords, private encryption keys, and more...

## Discovery 🔍

TruffleHog can look for secrets in many places including Git, chats, wikis, logs, API testing platforms, object stores, filesystems and more

## Classification 📁

TruffleHog classifies over 800 secret types, mapping them back to the specific identity they belong to. Is it an AWS secret? Stripe secret? Cloudflare secret? Postgres password? SSL Private key? Sometimes its hard to tell looking at it, so TruffleHog classifies everything it finds.

## Validation ✅

For every secret TruffleHog can classify, it can also log in to confirm if that secret is live or not. This step is critical to know if there’s an active present danger or not.

## Analysis 🔬

For the 20 some of the most commonly leaked out credential types, instead of sending one request to check if the secret can log in, TruffleHog can send many requests to learn everything there is to know about the secret. Who created it? What resources can it access? What permissions does it have on those resources?

curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -v -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Using installation script to install a specific version

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin &lt;ReleaseTag like v3.56.0&gt;
```

# :closed_lock_with_key: Verifying the artifacts

Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.

You need the following tool to verify signature:

- [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)

Verification steps are as follow:

1. Download the artifact files you want, and the following files from the [releases](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/releases) page.

   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt
   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt.pem
   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt.sig

2. Verify the signature:

   ```shell
   cosign verify-blob &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt&gt; \
   --certificate &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.pem&gt; \
   --signature &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.sig&gt; \
   --certificate-identity-regexp &#039;https://github\.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/\.github/workflows/.+&#039; \
   --certificate-oidc-issuer &quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot;
   ```

3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:

   ```shell
   sha256sum --ignore-missing -c trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt
   ```

Replace `{version}` with the downloaded files version

Alternatively, if you are using installation script, pass `-v` option to perform signature verification.
This required Cosign binary to be installed prior to running installation script.

...
```

## 4: Scan a GitHub Repo + its Issues and Pull Requests

```bash
trufflehog github --repo=https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys --issue-comments --pr-comments
```

## 5: Scan an S3 bucket for verified keys

trufflehog s3 --bucket=&lt;bucket name&gt; --results=verified,unknown
```

## 6: Scan S3 buckets using IAM Roles

```bash
trufflehog s3 --role-arn=&lt;iam role arn&gt;
```

## 7: Scan a Github Repo using SSH authentication in docker

```bash
docker run --rm -v &quot;$HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro&quot; trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest git ssh://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys
```

## 8: Scan individual files or directories

```bash
trufflehog filesystem path/to/file1.txt path/to/file2.txt path/to/dir
```

## 9: Scan a local git repo

Clone the git repo. For example [test keys](git@github.com:trufflesecurity/test_keys.git) repo.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:trufflesecurity/test_keys.git
```

Run trufflehog from the parent directory (outside the git repo).
```bash
$ trufflehog git file://test_keys --results=verified,unknown
```

## 10: Scan GCS buckets for verified secrets

```bash
trufflehog gcs --project-id=&lt;project-ID&gt; --cloud-environment --results=verified,unknown
```

## 11: Scan a Docker image for verified secrets

Use the `--image` flag multiple times to scan multiple images.

```bash
trufflehog docker --image trufflesecurity/secrets --results=verified,unknown
```

## 12: Scan in CI

Set the `--since-commit` flag to your default branch that people merge into (ex: &quot;main&quot;). Set the `--branch` flag to your PR&#039;s branch name (ex: &quot;feature-1&quot;). Depending on the CI/CD platform you use, this value can be pulled in dynamically (ex: [CIRCLE_BRANCH in Circle CI](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/) and [TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH in Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/)). If the repo is cloned and the target branch is already checked out during the CI/CD workflow, then `--branch HEAD` should be sufficient. The `--fail` flag will return an 183 error code if valid credentials are found.

```bash
trufflehog git file://. --since-commit main --branch feature-1 --results=verified,unknown --fail
```

## 13: Scan a Postman workspace

Use the `--workspace-id`, `--collection-id`, `--environment` flags multiple times to scan multiple targets.

```bash
trufflehog postman --token=&lt;postman api token&gt; --workspace-id=&lt;workspace id&gt;
```

## 14: Scan a Jenkins server

```bash
trufflehog jenkins --url https://jenkins.example.com --username admin --password admin
```

## 15: Scan an Elasticsearch server

### Scan a Local Cluster

There are two ways to authenticate to a local cluster with TruffleHog: (1) username and password, (2) service token.

#### Connect to a local cluster with username and password

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --username truffle --password hog
```

#### Connect to a local cluster with a service token

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --service-token ‘AAEWVaWM...Rva2VuaSDZ’
```

### Scan an Elastic Cloud Cluster

To scan a cluster on Elastic Cloud, you’ll need a Cloud ID and API key.

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch \
  --cloud-id &#039;search-prod:dXMtY2Vx...YjM1ODNlOWFiZGRlNjI0NA==&#039; \
  --api-key &#039;MlVtVjBZ...ZSYlduYnF1djh3NG5FQQ==&#039;
```

## 16. Scan a GitHub Repository for Cross Fork Object References and Deleted Commits

The following command will enumerate deleted and hidden commits on a GitHub repository and then scan them for secrets. This is an alpha release feature.

```bash
trufflehog github-experimental --repo https://github.com/&lt;USER&gt;/&lt;REPO&gt;.git --object-discovery
```

In addition to the normal TruffleHog output, the `--object-discovery` flag creates two files in a new `$HOME/.trufflehog` directory: `valid_hidden.txt` and `invalid.txt`. These are used to track state during commit enumeration, as well as to provide users with a complete list of all hidden and deleted commits (`valid_hidden.txt`). If you&#039;d like to automatically remove these files after scanning, please add the flag `--delete-cached-data`.

**Note**: Enumerating all valid commits on a repository using this method takes between 20 minutes and a few hours, depending on the size of your repository. We added a progress bar to keep you updated on how long the enumeration will take. The actual secret scanning runs extremely fast.

For more information on Cross Fork Object References, please [read our blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github).

## 17. Scan Hugging Face

### Scan a Hugging Face Model, Dataset or Space

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --model &lt;model_id&gt; --space &lt;space_id&gt; --dataset &lt;dataset_id&gt;
```

### Scan all Models, Datasets and Spaces belonging to a Hugging Face Organization or User

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --org &lt;orgname&gt; --user &lt;username&gt;
```

(Optionally) When scanning an organization or user, you can skip an entire class of resources with `--skip-models`, `--skip-datasets`, `--skip-spaces` OR a particular resource with `--ignore-models &lt;model_id&gt;`, `--ignore-datasets &lt;dataset_id&gt;`, `--ignore-spaces &lt;space_id&gt;`.

### Scan Discussion and PR Comments

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --model &lt;model_id&gt; --include-discussions --include-prs
```

## 18. Scan stdin Input

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://example/gzipped/data.gz - | gunzip -c | trufflehog stdin
```

# :question: FAQ

- All I see is `🐷🔑🐷  TruffleHog. Unearth your secrets. 🐷🔑🐷` and the program exits, what gives?
  - That means no secrets were detected
- Why is the scan taking a long time when I scan a GitHub org
  - Unauthenticated GitHub scans have rate limits. To improve your rate limits, include the `--token` flag with a personal access token
- It says a private key was verified, what does that mean?
  - Check out our Driftwood blog post to learn how to do this, in short we&#039;ve confirmed the key can be used live for SSH or SSL [Blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood-know-if-private-keys-are-sensitive/)
- Is there an easy way to ignore specific secrets?
  - If the scanned source [supports line numbers](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/d6375ba92172fd830abb4247cca15e3176448c5d/pkg/engine/engine.go#L358-L365), then you can add a `trufflehog:ignore` comment on the line containing the secret to ignore that secrets.

# :newspaper: What&#039;s new in v3?

TruffleHog v3 is a complete rewrite in Go with many new powerful features.

- We&#039;ve **added over 700 credential detectors that support active verification against their respective APIs**.
- We&#039;ve also added native **support for scanning GitHub, GitLab, Docker, filesystems, S3, GCS, Circle CI and Travis CI**.
- **Instantly verify private keys** against millions of github users and **billions** of TLS certificates using our [Driftwood](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood) technology.
- Scan binaries, documents, and other file formats
- Available as a GitHub Action and a pre-commit hook

## What is credential verification?

For every potential credential that is detected, we&#039;ve painstakingly implemented programmatic verification against the API that we think it belongs to. Verification eliminates false positives. For example, the [AWS credential detector](pkg/detectors/aws/aws.go) performs a `GetCallerIdentity` API call against the AWS API to verify if an AWS credential is active.

# :memo: Usage

TruffleHog has a sub-command for each source of data that you may want to scan:

- git
- github
- gitlab
- docker
- s3
- filesystem (files and directories)
- syslog
- circleci
- travisci
- gcs (Google Cloud Storage)
- postman
- jenkins
- elasticsearch
- stdin
- multi-scan

Each subcommand can have options that you can see with the `--help` flag provided to the sub command:

```
$ trufflehog git --help

For example, to scan a `git` repository, start with

```
trufflehog git https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog.git
```

## Configuration

TruffleHog supports defining [custom regex detectors](#regex-detector-alpha)
and multiple sources in a configuration file provided via the `--config` flag.
The regex detectors can be used with any subcommand, while the sources defined
in configuration are only for the `multi-scan` subcommand.

The configuration format for sources can be found on Truffle Security&#039;s

kube-state-metrics (KSM) is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API
server and generates metrics about the state of the objects. (See examples in
the Metrics section below.) It is not focused on the health of the individual
Kubernetes components, but rather on the health of the various objects inside,
such as deployments, nodes and pods.

kube-state-metrics is about generating metrics from Kubernetes API objects
without modification. This ensures that features provided by kube-state-metrics
have the same grade of stability as the Kubernetes API objects themselves. In
turn, this means that kube-state-metrics in certain situations may not show the
exact same values as kubectl, as kubectl applies certain heuristics to display
comprehensible messages. kube-state-metrics exposes raw data unmodified from the
Kubernetes API, this way users have all the data they require and perform
heuristics as they see fit.

The metrics are exported on the HTTP endpoint `/metrics` on the listening port
(default 8080). They are served as plaintext. They are designed to be consumed
either by Prometheus itself or by a scraper that is compatible with scraping a
Prometheus client endpoint. You can also open `/metrics` in a browser to see
the raw metrics. Note that the metrics exposed on the `/metrics` endpoint
reflect the current state of the Kubernetes cluster. When Kubernetes objects
are deleted they are no longer visible on the `/metrics` endpoint.

### Versioning

#### Kubernetes Version

kube-state-metrics uses [`client-go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) to talk with
Kubernetes clusters. The supported Kubernetes cluster version is determined by `client-go`.
The compatibility matrix for client-go and Kubernetes cluster can be found
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#compatibility-matrix).
All additional compatibility is only best effort, or happens to still/already be supported.

#### Compatibility matrix

At most, 5 kube-state-metrics and 5 [kubernetes releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases) will be recorded below.
Generally, it is recommended to use the latest release of kube-state-metrics. If you run a very recent version of Kubernetes, you might want to use an unreleased version to have the full range of supported resources. If you run an older version of Kubernetes, you might need to run an older version in order to have full support for all resources. Be aware, that the maintainers will only support the latest release. Older versions might be supported by interested users of the community.

| kube-state-metrics | Kubernetes client-go Version |
|--------------------|:----------------------------:|
| **v2.11.0**        | v1.28                        |
| **v2.12.0**        | v1.29                        |
| **v2.13.0**        | v1.30                        |
| **v2.14.0**        | v1.31                        |
| **v2.15.0**        | v1.32                        |
| **main**           | v1.32                        |

#### Resource group version compatibility

Resources in Kubernetes can evolve, i.e., the group version for a resource may change from alpha to beta and finally GA
in different Kubernetes versions. For now, kube-state-metrics will only use the oldest API available in the latest
release.

#### Container Image

The latest container image can be found at:

* `registry.k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/kube-state-metrics:v2.15.0` (arch: `amd64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `ppc64le` and `s390x`)
* View all multi-architecture images at [here](https://explore.ggcr.dev/?image=registry.k8s.io%2Fkube-state-metrics%2Fkube-state-metrics:v2.15.0)

### Metrics Documentation

Any resources and metrics based on alpha Kubernetes APIs are excluded from any stability guarantee,
which may be changed at any given release.

See the [`docs`](docs) directory for more information on the exposed metrics.

#### Conflict resolution in label names

The `*_labels` family of metrics exposes Kubernetes labels as Prometheus labels.
As [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set)
is more liberal than
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels)
in terms of allowed characters in label names,
we automatically convert unsupported characters to underscores.
For example, `app.kubernetes.io/name` becomes `label_app_kubernetes_io_name`.

This conversion can create conflicts when multiple Kubernetes labels like
`foo-bar` and `foo_bar` would be converted to the same Prometheus label `label_foo_bar`.

Kube-state-metrics automatically adds a suffix `_conflictN` to resolve this conflict,
so it converts the above labels to
`label_foo_bar_conflict1` and `label_foo_bar_conflict2`.

If you&#039;d like to have more control over how this conflict is resolved,
you might want to consider addressing this issue on a different level of the stack,
e.g. by standardizing Kubernetes labels using an
[Admission Webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/)
that ensures that there are no possible conflicts.

#### ECMAScript regular expression support for allow and deny lists

Starting from [#2616](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/pull/2616/files), kube-state-metrics supports ECMAScript&#039;s `regexp` for allow and deny lists. This was incorporated as a workaround for the limitations of the `regexp` package in Go, which does not support lookarounds due to their non-linear time complexity. Please note that while lookarounds are now supported for allow and deny lists, regular expressions&#039; evaluation time is capped at a minute to prevent performance issues.

### Kube-state-metrics self metrics

kube-state-metrics exposes its own general process metrics under `--telemetry-host` and `--telemetry-port` (default 8081).

kube-state-metrics also exposes list and watch success and error metrics. These can be used to calculate the error rate of list or watch resources.
If you encounter those errors in the metrics, it is most likely a configuration or permission issue, and the next thing to investigate would be looking
at the logs of kube-state-metrics.

Example of the above mentioned metrics:

```
kube_state_metrics_list_total{resource=&quot;*v1.Node&quot;,result=&quot;success&quot;} 1
kube_state_metrics_list_total{resource=&quot;*v1.Node&quot;,result=&quot;error&quot;} 52
kube_state_metrics_watch_total{resource=&quot;*v1beta1.Ingress&quot;,result=&quot;success&quot;} 1
```

kube-state-metrics also exposes some http request metrics, examples of those are:

```
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler=&quot;metrics&quot;,method=&quot;get&quot;,le=&quot;2.5&quot;} 30
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler=&quot;metrics&quot;,method=&quot;get&quot;,le=&quot;5&quot;} 30
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler=&quot;metrics&quot;,method=&quot;get&quot;,le=&quot;10&quot;} 30
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler=&quot;metrics&quot;,method=&quot;get&quot;,le=&quot;+Inf&quot;} 30
http_request_duration_seconds_sum{handler=&quot;metrics&quot;,method=&quot;get&quot;} 0.021113919999999998
http_request_duration_seconds_count{handler=&quot;metrics&quot;,method=&quot;get&quot;} 30
```

kube-state-metrics also exposes build and configuration metrics:

```
kube_state_metrics_build_info{branch=&quot;main&quot;,goversion=&quot;go1.15.3&quot;,revision=&quot;6c9d775d&quot;,version=&quot;v2.0.0-beta&quot;} 1
kube_state_metrics_shard_ordinal{shard_ordinal=&quot;0&quot;} 0
kube_state_metrics_total_shards 1
```

`kube_state_metrics_build_info` is used to expose version and other build information. For more usage about the info pattern,
please check the blog post [here](https://www.robustperception.io/exposing-the-software-version-to-prometheus).
Sharding metrics expose `--shard` and `--total-shards` flags and can be used to validate
run-time configuration, see [`/examples/prometheus-alerting-rules`](./examples/prometheus-alerting-rules).

kube-state-metrics also exposes metrics about it config file and the Custom Resource State config file:

```
kube_state_metrics_config_hash{filename=&quot;crs.yml&quot;,type=&quot;customresourceconfig&quot;} 2.38272279311849e+14
kube_state_metrics_config_hash{filename=&quot;config.yml&quot;,type=&quot;config&quot;} 2.65285922340846e+14
kube_state_metrics_last_config_reload_success_timestamp_seconds{filename=&quot;crs.yml&quot;,type=&quot;customresourceconfig&quot;} 1.6704882592037103e+09
kube_state_metrics_last_config_reload_success_timestamp_seconds{filename=&quot;config.yml&quot;,type=&quot;config&quot;} 1.6704882592035313e+09
kube_state_metrics_last_config_reload_successful{filename=&quot;crs.yml&quot;,type=&quot;customresourceconfig&quot;} 1
kube_state_metrics_last_config_reload_successful{filename=&quot;config.yml&quot;,type=&quot;config&quot;} 1
```

### Scaling kube-state-metrics

#### Resource recommendation

Resource usage for kube-state-metrics changes with the Kubernetes objects (Pods/Nodes/Deployments/Secrets etc.) size of the cluster.
To some extent, the Kubernetes objects in a cluster are in direct proportion to the node number of the cluster.

As a general rule, you should allocate:

* 250MiB memory
* 0.1 cores

Note that if CPU limits are set too low, kube-state-metrics&#039; internal queues will not be able to be worked off quickly enough, resulting in increased memory consumption as the queue length grows. If you experience problems resulting from high memory allocation or CPU throttling, try increasing the CPU limits.

### Latency

In a 100 node cluster scaling test the latency numbers were as follows:

```
&quot;Perc50&quot;: 259615384 ns,
&quot;Perc90&quot;: 475000000 ns,
&quot;Perc99&quot;: 906666666 ns.
```

### A note on costing

By default, kube-state-metrics exposes several metrics for events across your cluster. If you have a large number of frequently-updating resources on your cluster, you may find that a lot of data is ingested into these metrics. This can incur high costs on some cloud providers. Please take a moment to [configure what metrics you&#039;d like to expose](docs/developer/cli-arguments.md), as well as consult the documentation for your Kubernetes environment in order to avoid unexpectedly high costs.

### kube-state-metrics vs. metrics-server

The [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server)
is a project that has been inspired by
[Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/heapster) and is implemented
to serve the goals of core metrics pipelines in [Kubernetes monitoring
architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/instrumentation/monitoring_architecture.md).
It is a cluster level component which periodically scrapes metrics from all
Kubernetes nodes served by Kubelet through Metrics API. The metrics are
aggregated, stored in memory and served in [Metrics API
format](https://git.k8s.io/metrics/pkg/apis/metrics/v1alpha1/types.go). The
metrics-server stores the latest values only and is not responsible for
forwarding metrics to third-party destinations.

kube-state-metrics is focused on generating completely new metrics from
Kubernetes&#039; object state (e.g. metrics based on deployments, replica sets,
etc.). It holds an entire snapshot of Kubernetes state in memory and
continuously generates new metrics based off of it. And just like the
metrics-server it too is not responsible for exporting its metrics anywhere.

Having kube-state-metrics as a separate project also enables access to these
metrics from monitoring systems such as Prometheus.

### Horizontal sharding

In order to shard kube-state-metrics horizontally, some automated sharding capabilities have been implemented. It is configured with the following flags:

* `--shard` (zero indexed)
* `--total-shards`

Sharding is done by taking an md5 sum of the Kubernetes Object&#039;s UID and performing a modulo operation on it with the total number of shards. Each shard decides whether the object is handled by the respective instance of kube-state-metrics or not. Note that this means all instances of kube-state-metrics, even if sharded, will have the network traffic and the resource consumption for unmarshaling objects for all objects, not just the ones they are responsible for. To optimize this further, the Kubernetes API would need to support sharded list/watch capabilities. In the optimal case, memory consumption for each shard will be 1/n compared to an unsharded setup. Typically, kube-state-metrics needs to be memory and latency optimized in order for it to return its metrics rather quickly to Prometheus. One way to reduce the latency between kube-state-metrics and the kube-apiserver is to run KSM with the `--use-apiserver-cache` flag. In addition to reducing the latency, this option will also lead to a reduction in the load on etcd.

Sharding should be used carefully and additional monitoring should be set up in order to ensure that sharding is set up and functioning as expected (eg. instances for each shard out of the total shards are configured).

#### Automated sharding

Automatic sharding allows each shard to discover its nominal position when deployed in a StatefulSet which is useful for automatically configuring sharding. This is an experimental feature and may be broken or removed without notice.

To enable automated sharding, kube-state-metrics must be run by a `StatefulSet` and the pod name and namespace must be handed to the kube-state-metrics process via the `--pod` and `--pod-namespace` flags. Example manifests demonstrating the autosharding functionality can be found in [`/examples/autosharding`](./examples/autosharding).

This way of deploying shards is useful when you want to manage KSM shards through a single Kubernetes resource (a single `StatefulSet` in this case) instead of having one `Deployment` per shard. The advantage can be especially significant when deploying a high number of shards.

The downside of using an auto-sharded setup comes from the rollout strategy supported by `StatefulSet`s. When managed by a `StatefulSet`, pods are replaced one at a time with each pod first getting terminated and then recreated. Besides such rollouts being slower, they will also lead to short downtime for each shard. If a Prometheus scrape happens during a rollout, it can miss some of the metrics exported by kube-state-metrics.

### Daemonset sharding for pod metrics

For pod metrics, they can be sharded per node with the following flag:

* `--node=$(NODE_NAME)`

Each kube-state-metrics pod uses FieldSelector (spec.nodeName) to watch/list pod metrics only on the same node.

A daemonset kube-state-metrics example:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/kube-state-metrics:IMAGE_TAG
        name: kube-state-metrics
        args:
        - --resource=pods
        - --node=$(NODE_NAME)
        env:
        - name: NODE_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
              fieldPath: spec.nodeName
```

To track metrics for unassigned pods, you need to add an additional deployment and set `--track-unscheduled-pods`, as shown in the following example:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/kube-state-metrics:IMAGE_TAG
        name: kube-state-metrics
        args:
        - --resources=pods
        - --track-unscheduled-pods
```

Other metrics can be sharded via [Horizontal sharding](#horizontal-sharding).

### Setup

Install this project to your `$GOPATH` using `go get`:

```
go get k8s.io/kube-state-metrics
```

#### Building the Docker container

Simply run the following command in this root folder, which will create a
self-contained, statically-linked binary and build a Docker image:

```
make container
```

### Usage

Simply build and run kube-state-metrics inside a Kubernetes pod which has a
service account token that has read-only access to the Kubernetes cluster.

#### For users of prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus stack

The ([`kube-prometheus`](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/)) stack installs kube-state-metrics as one of its [components](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus#kube-prometheus); you do not need to install kube-state-metrics if you&#039;re using the kube-prometheus stack.

If you want to revise the default configuration for kube-prometheus, for example to enable non-default metrics, have a look at [Customizing Kube-Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/blob/main/docs/customizing.md).

#### Kubernetes Deployment

To deploy this project, you can simply run `kubectl apply -f examples/standard` and a Kubernetes service and deployment will be created. (Note: Adjust the apiVersion of some resource if your kubernetes cluster&#039;s version is not 1.8+, check the yaml file for more information).

To have Prometheus discover kube-state-metrics instances it is advised to create a specific Prometheus scrape config for kube-state-metrics that picks up both metrics endpoints. Annotation based discovery is discouraged as only one of the endpoints would be able to be selected, plus kube-state-metrics in most cases has special authentication and authorization requirements as it essentially grants read access through the metrics endpoint to most information available to it.

**Note:** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Users - GKE has strict role permissions that will prevent the kube-state-metrics roles and role bindings from being created. To work around this, you can give your GCP identity the cluster-admin role by running the following one-liner:

```

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

etcd is used [in production by many companies](./ADOPTERS.md), and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as [Kubernetes][k8s], [locksmith][], [vulcand][], [Doorman][], and many others. Reliability is further ensured by rigorous [**robustness testing**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness).

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.

## Maintainers

[Maintainers](OWNERS) strive to shape an inclusive open source project culture where users are heard and contributors feel respected and empowered. Maintainers aim to build productive relationships across different companies and disciplines. Read more about [Maintainers role and responsibilities](Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md#maintainers).

## Getting started

### Getting etcd

The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker on the [release page][github-release].

For more installation guides, please check out [play.etcd.io](http://play.etcd.io) and [operating etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide).

[github-release]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases

### Running etcd

First start a single-member cluster of etcd.

If etcd is installed using the [pre-built release binaries][github-release], run it from the installation location as below:

```bash
/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd
```

The etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:

```bash
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/
etcd
```

This will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.

Next, let&#039;s set a single key, and then retrieve it:

```bash
etcdctl put mykey &quot;this is awesome&quot;
etcdctl get mykey
```

etcd is now running and serving client requests. For more, please check out:

* [Interactive etcd playground](http://play.etcd.io)
* [Animated quick demo](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/demo)

### etcd TCP ports

The [official etcd ports][iana-ports] are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.

[iana-ports]: http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

### Running a local etcd cluster

First install [goreman](https://github.com/mattn/goreman), which manages Procfile-based applications.

Our [Procfile script](./Procfile) will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:

```bash
goreman start
```

This will bring up 3 etcd members `infra1`, `infra2` and `infra3` and optionally etcd `grpc-proxy`, which runs locally and composes a cluster.

Every cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.

Follow the comments in [Procfile script](./Procfile) to add a learner node to the cluster.

### Install etcd client v3

```bash
go get go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3
```

### Next steps

Now it&#039;s time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.

* Read the full [documentation].
* Review etcd [frequently asked questions].
* Explore the full gRPC [API].
* Set up a [multi-machine cluster][clustering].
* Learn the [config format, env variables and flags][configuration].
* Find [language bindings and tools][integrations].
* Use TLS to [secure an etcd cluster][security].
* [Tune etcd][tuning].

![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true &quot;Docker Compose Logo&quot;)

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.

# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app&#039;s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `compose.yaml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - &quot;5000:5000&quot;
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```

[contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you find an issue, please report it on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).

Legacy
-------------

The Python version of Compose is available under the `v1` [branch](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1).

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## BNB Smart Chain

The goal of BNB Smart Chain is to bring programmability and interoperability to BNB Beacon Chain. In order to embrace the existing popular community and advanced technology, it will bring huge benefits by staying compatible with all the existing smart contracts on Ethereum and Ethereum tooling. And to achieve that, the easiest solution is to develop based on go-ethereum fork, as we respect the great work of Ethereum very much.

BNB Smart Chain starts its development based on go-ethereum fork. So you may see many toolings, binaries and also docs are based on Ethereum ones, such as the name &quot;geth&quot;.

[![API Reference](
https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum?tab=doc)
[![Build Test](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/actions/workflows/build-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/actions)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join%20chat-blue.svg)](https://discord.gg/z2VpC455eU)

But from that baseline of EVM compatible, BNB Smart Chain introduces a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.

**The BNB Smart Chain** will be:

- **A self-sovereign blockchain**: Provides security and safety with elected validators.
- **EVM-compatible**: Supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster finality and cheaper transaction fees.
- **Distributed with on-chain governance**: Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community participants. As the native token, BNB will serve as both the gas of smart contract execution and tokens for staking.

More details in [White Paper](https://github.com/bnb-chain/whitepaper/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md).

## Key features

### Proof of Staked Authority 
Although Proof-of-Work (PoW) has been approved as a practical mechanism to implement a decentralized network, it is not friendly to the environment and also requires a large size of participants to maintain the security. 

Proof-of-Authority(PoA) provides some defense to 51% attack, with improved efficiency and tolerance to certain levels of Byzantine players (malicious or hacked). 
Meanwhile, the PoA protocol is most criticized for being not as decentralized as PoW, as the validators, i.e. the nodes that take turns to produce blocks, have all the authorities and are prone to corruption and security attacks.

Other blockchains, such as EOS and Cosmos both, introduce different types of Deputy Proof of Stake (DPoS) to allow the token holders to vote and elect the validator set. It increases the decentralization and favors community governance. 

To combine DPoS and PoA for consensus, BNB Smart Chain implement a novel consensus engine called Parlia that:

1. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators.
2. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner, similar to Ethereum&#039;s Clique consensus engine.
3. Validator set are elected in and out based on a staking based governance on BNB Smart Chain.
4. Parlia consensus engine will interact with a set of [system contracts](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/staking/overview/#system-contracts) to achieve liveness slash, revenue distributing and validator set renewing func.

## Native Token

BNB will run on BNB Smart Chain in the same way as ETH runs on Ethereum so that it remains as `native token` for BSC. This means,
BNB will be used to:

1. pay `gas` to deploy or invoke Smart Contract on BSC

## Building the source

Many of the below are the same as or similar to go-ethereum.

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.22 or later) and a C compiler (GCC 5 or higher). You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

If you get such error when running the node with self built binary:
```shell
Caught SIGILL in blst_cgo_init, consult &lt;blst&gt;/bindinds/go/README.md.
```
please try to add the following environment variables and build again:
```shell
export CGO_CFLAGS=&quot;-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__&quot; 
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW=&quot;-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__&quot;
```

## Executables

The bsc project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  Command   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **`geth`** | Main BNB Smart Chain client binary. It is the entry point into the BSC network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It has the same and more RPC and other interface as go-ethereum and can be used by other processes as a gateway into the BSC network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options. |
|   `clef`   | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  `devp2p`  | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  `abigen`  | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) page for details.                                                                                               |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   `evm`    | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we&#039;ve enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

The hardware must meet certain requirements to run a full node on mainnet:
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
- IMPORTANT 3 TB(Dec 2023) of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 500 MB/S throughput, read latency &lt;1ms. (if node is started with snap sync, it will need NVMe SSD)
- 16 cores of CPU and 64 GB of memory (RAM)
- Suggest m5zn.6xlarge or r7iz.4xlarge instance type on AWS, c2-standard-16 on Google cloud.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 5 MB/S

The requirement for testnet:
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
- 500G of storage for testnet.
- 4 cores of CPU and 16 gigabytes of memory (RAM).

### Steps to Run a Fullnode

#### 1. Download the pre-build binaries
```shell
# Linux
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_linux |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
mv geth_linux geth
chmod -v u+x geth

# MacOS
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_mac |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
mv geth_macos geth
chmod -v u+x geth
```

#### 2. Download the config files
```shell
//== mainnet
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mainnet |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
unzip mainnet.zip

//== testnet
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep testnet |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
unzip testnet.zip
```

#### 3. Download snapshot
Download latest chaindata snapshot from [here](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-snapshots). Follow the guide to structure your files.

#### 4. Start a full node
```shell
## It will run with Path-Base Storage Scheme by default and enable inline state prune, keeping the latest 90000 blocks&#039; history state.
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --history.transactions 0

## It is recommend to run fullnode with `--tries-verify-mode none` if you want high performance and care little about state consistency.
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --history.transactions 0 --tries-verify-mode none
```

#### 5. Monitor node status

Monitor the log from **./node/bsc.log** by default. When the node has started syncing, should be able to see the following output:
```shell
t=2022-09-08T13:00:27+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=177   mgas=17.317   elapsed=31.131ms    mgasps=556.259  number=21,153,429 hash=0x42e6b54ba7106387f0650defc62c9ace3160b427702dab7bd1c5abb83a32d8db dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
t=2022-09-08T13:00:29+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=251   mgas=39.638   elapsed=68.827ms    mgasps=575.900  number=21,153,430 hash=0xa3397b273b31b013e43487689782f20c03f47525b4cd4107c1715af45a88796e dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
t=2022-09-08T13:00:33+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=197   mgas=19.364   elapsed=34.663ms    mgasps=558.632  number=21,153,431 hash=0x0c7872b698f28cb5c36a8a3e1e315b1d31bda6109b15467a9735a12380e2ad14 dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
```

#### 6. Interact with fullnode
Start up `geth`&#039;s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/javascript-console),
(via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/) 
(note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
as well as `geth`&#039;s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server).
This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
`geth` instance with `geth attach`.

#### 7. More

More details about [running a node](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/developers/node_operators/full_node/) and [becoming a validator](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/validator/create-val/)

*Note: Although some internal protective measures prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should always
use separate accounts for play and real money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you&#039;ll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
BSC network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/),
[`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc), and [BSC&#039;s JSON-RPC API Reference](rpc/json-rpc-api.md)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you&#039;d expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API&#039;s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API&#039;s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You&#039;ll need to use your own programming environments&#039; capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you&#039;ll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
BSC nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network
- [BSC-Deploy](https://github.com/bnb-chain/node-deploy/): deploy tool for setting up BNB Smart Chain.

## Running a bootnode

Bootnodes are super-lightweight nodes that are not behind a NAT and are running just discovery protocol. When you start up a node it should log your enode, which is a public identifier that others can use to connect to your node. 

First the bootnode requires a key, which can be created with the following command, which will save a key to boot.key:

```
bootnode -genkey boot.key
```

This key can then be used to generate a bootnode as follows:

```
bootnode -nodekey boot.key -addr :30311 -network bsc
```

The choice of port passed to -addr is arbitrary. 
The bootnode command returns the following logs to the terminal, confirming that it is running:

```
enode://3063d1c9e1b824cfbb7c7b6abafa34faec6bb4e7e06941d218d760acdd7963b274278c5c3e63914bd6d1b58504c59ec5522c56f883baceb8538674b92da48a96@127.0.0.1:0?discport=30311
Note: you&#039;re using cmd/bootnode, a developer tool.
We recommend using a regular node as bootstrap node for production deployments.

### Compatibility

OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib ensures compatibility with the current supported
versions of
the [Go language](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy):

&gt; Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
&gt; For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release.

For versions of Go that are no longer supported upstream, opentelemetry-go-contrib will
stop ensuring compatibility with these versions in the following manner:

- A minor release of opentelemetry-go-contrib will be made to add support for the new
  supported release of Go.
- The following minor release of opentelemetry-go-contrib will remove compatibility
  testing for the oldest (now archived upstream) version of Go. This, and
  future, releases of opentelemetry-go-contrib may include features only supported by
  the currently supported versions of Go.

This project is tested on the following systems.

| OS       | Go Version | Architecture |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | 386          |
| macOS 13 | 1.24       | amd64        |
| macOS 13 | 1.23       | amd64        |
| macOS    | 1.24       | arm64        |
| macOS    | 1.23       | arm64        |
| Windows  | 1.24       | amd64        |

| Windows  | 1.24       | 386          |
| Windows  | 1.23       | 386          |

While this project should work for other systems, no compatibility guarantees
are made for those systems currently.

**JuiceFS** is a high-performance [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) file system released under Apache License 2.0, particularly designed for the cloud-native environment. The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in Object Storage _(e.g. Amazon S3)_, and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various compatible database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and TiKV based on the scenarios and requirements.

With JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage.

📖 **Document**: [Quick Start Guide](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/quick_start_guide)

## Highlighted Features

## Architecture

JuiceFS consists of three parts:

1. **JuiceFS Client**: Coordinates Object Storage and metadata storage engine as well as implementation of file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway.
2. **Data Storage**: Stores data, with supports of a variety of data storage media, e.g., local disk, public or private cloud Object Storage, and HDFS.
3. **Metadata Engine**: Stores the corresponding metadata that contains information of file name, file size, permission group, creation and modification time and directory structure, etc., with supports of different metadata engines, e.g., Redis, MySQL, SQLite and TiKV.

![JuiceFS Architecture](docs/en/images/juicefs-arch-new.png)

JuiceFS can store the metadata of file system on different metadata engines, like Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in Object Storage through JuiceFS client. [Learn more](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/architecture)

![data-structure-diagram](docs/en/images/data-structure-diagram.svg)

Each file stored in JuiceFS is split into **&quot;Chunk&quot;** s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more **&quot;Slice&quot;**(s), and the length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice is composed of size-fixed **&quot;Block&quot;** s, which are 4 MiB by default. These blocks will be stored in Object Storage in the end; at the same time, the metadata information of the file and its Chunks, Slices, and Blocks will be stored in metadata engines via JuiceFS. [Learn more](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/architecture/#how-juicefs-store-files)

![How JuiceFS stores your files](docs/en/images/how-juicefs-stores-files.svg)

When using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in Object Storage. Therefore, the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the Object Storage platform; instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. Don&#039;t panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS!

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. One supported metadata engine, see [How to Set Up Metadata Engine](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/databases_for_metadata)

## POSIX Compatibility

JuiceFS has passed all of the compatibility tests (8813 in total) in the latest [pjdfstest](https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest) .

```
All tests successful.

Test Summary Report
-------------------
/root/soft/pjdfstest/tests/chown/00.t          (Wstat: 0 Tests: 1323 Failed: 0)
  TODO passed:   693, 697, 708-709, 714-715, 729, 733
Files=235, Tests=8813, 233 wallclock secs ( 2.77 usr  0.38 sys +  2.57 cusr  3.93 csys =  9.65 CPU)
Result: PASS
```

Aside from the POSIX features covered by pjdfstest, JuiceFS also provides:

- **Close-to-open consistency**. Once a file is written _and_ closed, it is guaranteed to view the written data in the following opens and reads from any client. Within the same mount point, all the written data can be read immediately.
- Rename and all other metadata operations are atomic, which are guaranteed by supported metadata engine transaction.
- Opened files remain accessible after unlink from same mount point.
- Mmap (tested with FSx).
- Fallocate with punch hole support.
- Extended attributes (xattr).
- BSD locks (flock).
- POSIX record locks (fcntl).

## Performance Benchmark

### Basic benchmark

JuiceFS provides a subcommand that can run a few basic benchmarks to help you understand how it works in your environment:

![JuiceFS Bench](docs/en/images/juicefs-bench.png)

### Throughput

A sequential read/write benchmark has also been performed on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [fio](https://github.com/axboe/fio).

![Sequential Read Write Benchmark](docs/en/images/sequential-read-write-benchmark.svg)

Above result figure shows that JuiceFS can provide 10X more throughput than the other two (see [more details](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/fio)).

### Metadata IOPS

A simple mdtest benchmark has been performed on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [mdtest](https://github.com/hpc/ior).

![Metadata Benchmark](docs/en/images/metadata-benchmark.svg)

The result shows that JuiceFS can provide significantly more metadata IOPS than the other two (see [more details](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/mdtest)).

## FAQ

### Why doesn&#039;t JuiceFS support XXX Object Storage?

JuiceFS supports many Object Storage services. Please check out [this list](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_setup_object_storage#supported-object-storage) first. If the Object Storage you want to use is compatible with S3, you could treat it as S3. Otherwise, try reporting any issue.

### Can I use Redis Cluster as metadata engine?

Yes. Since [v1.0.0 Beta3](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3) JuiceFS supports the use of [Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/docs/manual/scaling) as the metadata engine, but it should be noted that Redis Cluster requires that the keys of all operations in a transaction must be in the same hash slot, so a JuiceFS file system can only use one hash slot.

See [&quot;Redis Best Practices&quot;](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/redis_best_practices) for more information.

### What&#039;s the difference between JuiceFS and XXX?

See [&quot;Comparison with Others&quot;](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/comparison/juicefs_vs_alluxio) for more information.

For more FAQs, please see the [full list](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/faq).

# LiveKit: Real-time video, audio and data for developers

[LiveKit](https://livekit.io) is an open source project that provides scalable, multi-user conferencing based on WebRTC.
It&#039;s designed to provide everything you need to build real-time video audio data capabilities in your applications.

LiveKit&#039;s server is written in Go, using the awesome [Pion WebRTC](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) implementation.

### Server SDKs

Server SDKs enable your backend to generate [access tokens](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/),
call [server APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/server/server-apis/), and
receive [webhooks](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/webhooks/). In addition, the Go SDK includes client capabilities,
enabling you to build automations that behave like end-users.

### Tools

-   [CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) - command line interface &amp; load tester
-   [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/livekit/livekit-server)
-   [Helm charts](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-helm)

## Install

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend installing [LiveKit CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) along with the server. It lets you access
&gt; server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic.

The following will install LiveKit&#039;s media server:

### MacOS

```shell
brew install livekit
```

### Linux

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io | bash
```

### Windows

Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases/latest)

## Getting Started

### Starting LiveKit

Start LiveKit in development mode by running `livekit-server --dev`. It&#039;ll use a placeholder API key/secret pair.

```
API Key: devkey
API Secret: secret
```

To customize your setup for production, refer to our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/)

### Creating access token

A user connecting to a LiveKit room requires an [access token](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/#creating-a-token). Access
tokens (JWT) encode the user&#039;s identity and the room permissions they&#039;ve been granted. You can generate a token with our
CLI:

```shell
lk token create \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --join --room my-first-room --identity user1 \
    --valid-for 24h
```

### Test with example app

Head over to our [example app](https://example.livekit.io) and enter a generated token to connect to your LiveKit
server. This app is built with our [React SDK](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-react).

Once connected, your video and audio are now being published to your new LiveKit instance!

### Simulating a test publisher

```shell
lk room join \
    --url ws://localhost:7880 \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --identity bot-user1 \
    --publish-demo \
    my-first-room
```

This command publishes a looped demo video to a room. Due to how the video clip was encoded (keyframes every 3s),
there&#039;s a slight delay before the browser has sufficient data to begin rendering frames. This is an artifact of the
simulation.

## Deployment

### Use LiveKit Cloud

LiveKit Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run LiveKit. Every project gets free monthly bandwidth and
transcoding credits.

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

### Self-host

Read our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/) for more information.

## Building from source

Pre-requisites:

-   Go 1.23+ is installed
-   GOPATH/bin is in your PATH

Then run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/livekit/livekit
cd livekit
./bootstrap.sh
mage
```

Logrus is a structured logger for Go (golang), completely API compatible with
the standard library logger.

**Logrus is in maintenance-mode.** We will not be introducing new features. It&#039;s
simply too hard to do in a way that won&#039;t break many people&#039;s projects, which is
the last thing you want from your Logging library (again...).

This does not mean Logrus is dead. Logrus will continue to be maintained for
security, (backwards compatible) bug fixes, and performance (where we are
limited by the interface).

I believe Logrus&#039; biggest contribution is to have played a part in today&#039;s
widespread use of structured logging in Golang. There doesn&#039;t seem to be a
reason to do a major, breaking iteration into Logrus V2, since the fantastic Go
community has built those independently. Many fantastic alternatives have sprung
up. Logrus would look like those, had it been re-designed with what we know
about structured logging in Go today. Check out, for example,
[Zerolog][zerolog], [Zap][zap], and [Apex][apex].

[zerolog]: https://github.com/rs/zerolog
[zap]: https://github.com/uber-go/zap
[apex]: https://github.com/apex/log

**Seeing weird case-sensitive problems?** It&#039;s in the past been possible to
import Logrus as both upper- and lower-case. Due to the Go package environment,
this caused issues in the community and we needed a standard. Some environments
experienced problems with the upper-case variant, so the lower-case was decided.
Everything using `logrus` will need to use the lower-case:
`github.com/sirupsen/logrus`. Any package that isn&#039;t, should be changed.

To fix Glide, see [these
comments](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/553#issuecomment-306591437).
For an in-depth explanation of the casing issue, see [this
comment](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/570#issuecomment-313933276).

Nicely color-coded in development (when a TTY is attached, otherwise just
plain text):

![Colored](http://i.imgur.com/PY7qMwd.png)

With `log.SetFormatter(&amp;log.JSONFormatter{})`, for easy parsing by logstash
or Splunk:

```text
{&quot;animal&quot;:&quot;walrus&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;A group of walrus emerges from the
ocean&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:10,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562264131 -0400 EDT&quot;}

{&quot;level&quot;:&quot;warning&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;The group&#039;s number increased tremendously!&quot;,
&quot;number&quot;:122,&quot;omg&quot;:true,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562471297 -0400 EDT&quot;}

{&quot;animal&quot;:&quot;walrus&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;A giant walrus appears!&quot;,
&quot;size&quot;:10,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562500591 -0400 EDT&quot;}

{&quot;animal&quot;:&quot;walrus&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;Tremendously sized cow enters the ocean.&quot;,
&quot;size&quot;:9,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562527896 -0400 EDT&quot;}

{&quot;level&quot;:&quot;fatal&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;The ice breaks!&quot;,&quot;number&quot;:100,&quot;omg&quot;:true,
&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562543128 -0400 EDT&quot;}
```

With the default `log.SetFormatter(&amp;log.TextFormatter{})` when a TTY is not
attached, the output is compatible with the
[logfmt](http://godoc.org/github.com/kr/logfmt) format:

```text
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=debug msg=&quot;Started observing beach&quot; animal=walrus number=8
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=info msg=&quot;A group of walrus emerges from the ocean&quot; animal=walrus size=10
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=warning msg=&quot;The group&#039;s number increased tremendously!&quot; number=122 omg=true
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=debug msg=&quot;Temperature changes&quot; temperature=-4
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=panic msg=&quot;It&#039;s over 9000!&quot; animal=orca size=9009
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=fatal msg=&quot;The ice breaks!&quot; err=&amp;{0x2082280c0 map[animal:orca size:9009] 2015-03-26 01:27:38.441574009 -0400 EDT panic It&#039;s over 9000!} number=100 omg=true
```
To ensure this behaviour even if a TTY is attached, set your formatter as follows:

```go
	log.SetFormatter(&amp;log.TextFormatter{
		DisableColors: true,
		FullTimestamp: true,
	})
```

#### Logging Method Name

If you wish to add the calling method as a field, instruct the logger via:
```go
log.SetReportCaller(true)
```
This adds the caller as &#039;method&#039; like so:

```json
{&quot;animal&quot;:&quot;penguin&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;fatal&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;github.com/sirupsen/arcticcreatures.migrate&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;a penguin swims by&quot;,
&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-03-10 19:57:38.562543129 -0400 EDT&quot;}
```

```text
time=&quot;2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00&quot; level=fatal method=github.com/sirupsen/arcticcreatures.migrate msg=&quot;a penguin swims by&quot; animal=penguin
```
Note that this does add measurable overhead - the cost will depend on the version of Go, but is
between 20 and 40% in recent tests with 1.6 and 1.7.  You can validate this in your
environment via benchmarks:
```
go test -bench=.*CallerTracing
```


#### Case-sensitivity

The organization&#039;s name was changed to lower-case--and this will not be changed
back. If you are getting import conflicts due to case sensitivity, please use
the lower-case import: `github.com/sirupsen/logrus`.

#### Example

The simplest way to use Logrus is simply the package-level exported logger:

```go
package main

import (
  log &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
)

func main() {
  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;animal&quot;: &quot;walrus&quot;,
  }).Info(&quot;A walrus appears&quot;)
}
```

Note that it&#039;s completely api-compatible with the stdlib logger, so you can
replace your `log` imports everywhere with `log &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;`
and you&#039;ll now have the flexibility of Logrus. You can customize it all you
want:

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;os&quot;
  log &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
)

func init() {
  // Log as JSON instead of the default ASCII formatter.
  log.SetFormatter(&amp;log.JSONFormatter{})

  // Output to stdout instead of the default stderr
  // Can be any io.Writer, see below for File example
  log.SetOutput(os.Stdout)

  // Only log the warning severity or above.
  log.SetLevel(log.WarnLevel)
}

func main() {
  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;animal&quot;: &quot;walrus&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;:   10,
  }).Info(&quot;A group of walrus emerges from the ocean&quot;)

  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;omg&quot;:    true,
    &quot;number&quot;: 122,
  }).Warn(&quot;The group&#039;s number increased tremendously!&quot;)

  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;omg&quot;:    true,
    &quot;number&quot;: 100,
  }).Fatal(&quot;The ice breaks!&quot;)

  // A common pattern is to re-use fields between logging statements by re-using
  // the logrus.Entry returned from WithFields()
  contextLogger := log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    &quot;common&quot;: &quot;this is a common field&quot;,
    &quot;other&quot;: &quot;I also should be logged always&quot;,
  })

  contextLogger.Info(&quot;I&#039;ll be logged with common and other field&quot;)
  contextLogger.Info(&quot;Me too&quot;)
}
```

For more advanced usage such as logging to multiple locations from the same
application, you can also create an instance of the `logrus` Logger:

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;os&quot;
  &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
)

// Create a new instance of the logger. You can have any number of instances.
var log = logrus.New()

func main() {
  // The API for setting attributes is a little different than the package level
  // exported logger. See Godoc.
  log.Out = os.Stdout

  // You could set this to any `io.Writer` such as a file
  // file, err := os.OpenFile(&quot;logrus.log&quot;, os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
  // if err == nil {
  //  log.Out = file
  // } else {
  //  log.Info(&quot;Failed to log to file, using default stderr&quot;)
  // }

  log.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
    &quot;animal&quot;: &quot;walrus&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;:   10,
  }).Info(&quot;A group of walrus emerges from the ocean&quot;)
}
```

#### Fields

Logrus encourages careful, structured logging through logging fields instead of
long, unparseable error messages. For example, instead of: `log.Fatalf(&quot;Failed
to send event %s to topic %s with key %d&quot;)`, you should log the much more
discoverable:

```go
log.WithFields(log.Fields{
  &quot;event&quot;: event,
  &quot;topic&quot;: topic,
  &quot;key&quot;: key,
}).Fatal(&quot;Failed to send event&quot;)
```

We&#039;ve found this API forces you to think about logging in a way that produces
much more useful logging messages. We&#039;ve been in countless situations where just
a single added field to a log statement that was already there would&#039;ve saved us
hours. The `WithFields` call is optional.

In general, with Logrus using any of the `printf`-family functions should be
seen as a hint you should add a field, however, you can still use the
`printf`-family functions with Logrus.

#### Default Fields

Often it&#039;s helpful to have fields _always_ attached to log statements in an
application or parts of one. For example, you may want to always log the
`request_id` and `user_ip` in the context of a request. Instead of writing
`log.WithFields(log.Fields{&quot;request_id&quot;: request_id, &quot;user_ip&quot;: user_ip})` on
every line, you can create a `logrus.Entry` to pass around instead:

```go
requestLogger := log.WithFields(log.Fields{&quot;request_id&quot;: request_id, &quot;user_ip&quot;: user_ip})
requestLogger.Info(&quot;something happened on that request&quot;) # will log request_id and user_ip
requestLogger.Warn(&quot;something not great happened&quot;)
```

#### Hooks

You can add hooks for logging levels. For example to send errors to an exception
tracking service on `Error`, `Fatal` and `Panic`, info to StatsD or log to
multiple places simultaneously, e.g. syslog.

Logrus comes with [built-in hooks](hooks/). Add those, or your custom hook, in
`init`:

```go
import (
  log &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
  &quot;gopkg.in/gemnasium/logrus-airbrake-hook.v2&quot; // the package is named &quot;airbrake&quot;
  logrus_syslog &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus/hooks/syslog&quot;
  &quot;log/syslog&quot;
)

func init() {

  // Use the Airbrake hook to report errors that have Error severity or above to
  // an exception tracker. You can create custom hooks, see the Hooks section.
  log.AddHook(airbrake.NewHook(123, &quot;xyz&quot;, &quot;production&quot;))

  hook, err := logrus_syslog.NewSyslogHook(&quot;udp&quot;, &quot;localhost:514&quot;, syslog.LOG_INFO, &quot;&quot;)
  if err != nil {
    log.Error(&quot;Unable to connect to local syslog daemon&quot;)
  } else {
    log.AddHook(hook)
  }
}
```
Note: Syslog hook also support connecting to local syslog (Ex. &quot;/dev/log&quot; or &quot;/var/run/syslog&quot; or &quot;/var/run/log&quot;). For the detail, please check the [syslog hook README](hooks/syslog/README.md).

A list of currently known service hooks can be found in this wiki [page](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/wiki/Hooks)


#### Level logging

Logrus has seven logging levels: Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal and Panic.

```go
log.Trace(&quot;Something very low level.&quot;)
log.Debug(&quot;Useful debugging information.&quot;)
log.Info(&quot;Something noteworthy happened!&quot;)
log.Warn(&quot;You should probably take a look at this.&quot;)
log.Error(&quot;Something failed but I&#039;m not quitting.&quot;)
// Calls os.Exit(1) after logging
log.Fatal(&quot;Bye.&quot;)
// Calls panic() after logging
log.Panic(&quot;I&#039;m bailing.&quot;)
```

You can set the logging level on a `Logger`, then it will only log entries with
that severity or anything above it:

```go
// Will log anything that is info or above (warn, error, fatal, panic). Default.
log.SetLevel(log.InfoLevel)
```

It may be useful to set `log.Level = logrus.DebugLevel` in a debug or verbose
environment if your application has that.

Note: If you want different log levels for global (`log.SetLevel(...)`) and syslog logging, please check the [syslog hook README](hooks/syslog/README.md#different-log-levels-for-local-and-remote-logging).

#### Entries

Besides the fields added with `WithField` or `WithFields` some fields are
automatically added to all logging events:

1. `time`. The timestamp when the entry was created.
2. `msg`. The logging message passed to `{Info,Warn,Error,Fatal,Panic}` after
   the `AddFields` call. E.g. `Failed to send event.`
3. `level`. The logging level. E.g. `info`.

#### Environments

Logrus has no notion of environment.

If you wish for hooks and formatters to only be used in specific environments,
you should handle that yourself. For example, if your application has a global
variable `Environment`, which is a string representation of the environment you
could do:

```go
import (
  log &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
)

func init() {
  // do something here to set environment depending on an environment variable
  // or command-line flag
  if Environment == &quot;production&quot; {
    log.SetFormatter(&amp;log.JSONFormatter{})
  } else {
    // The TextFormatter is default, you don&#039;t actually have to do this.
    log.SetFormatter(&amp;log.TextFormatter{})
  }
}
```

This configuration is how `logrus` was intended to be used, but JSON in
production is mostly only useful if you do log aggregation with tools like
Splunk or Logstash.

#### Formatters

The built-in logging formatters are:

* `logrus.TextFormatter`. Logs the event in colors if stdout is a tty, otherwise
  without colors.
  * *Note:* to force colored output when there is no TTY, set the `ForceColors`
    field to `true`.  To force no colored output even if there is a TTY  set the
    `DisableColors` field to `true`. For Windows, see
    [github.com/mattn/go-colorable](https://github.com/mattn/go-colorable).
  * When colors are enabled, levels are truncated to 4 characters by default. To disable
    truncation set the `DisableLevelTruncation` field to `true`.
  * When outputting to a TTY, it&#039;s often helpful to visually scan down a column where all the levels are the same width. Setting the `PadLevelText` field to `true` enables this behavior, by adding padding to the level text.
  * All options are listed in the [generated docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/sirupsen/logrus#TextFormatter).
* `logrus.JSONFormatter`. Logs fields as JSON.
  * All options are listed in the [generated docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/sirupsen/logrus#JSONFormatter).

Third party logging formatters:

* [`FluentdFormatter`](https://github.com/joonix/log). Formats entries that can be parsed by Kubernetes and Google Container Engine.
* [`GELF`](https://github.com/fabienm/go-logrus-formatters). Formats entries so they comply to Graylog&#039;s [GELF 1.1 specification](http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.4/pages/gelf.html).
* [`logstash`](https://github.com/bshuster-repo/logrus-logstash-hook). Logs fields as [Logstash](http://logstash.net) Events.
* [`prefixed`](https://github.com/x-cray/logrus-prefixed-formatter). Displays log entry source along with alternative layout.
* [`zalgo`](https://github.com/aybabtme/logzalgo). Invoking the Power of Zalgo.
* [`nested-logrus-formatter`](https://github.com/antonfisher/nested-logrus-formatter). Converts logrus fields to a nested structure.
* [`powerful-logrus-formatter`](https://github.com/zput/zxcTool). get fileName, log&#039;s line number and the latest function&#039;s name when print log; Save log to files.
* [`caption-json-formatter`](https://github.com/nolleh/caption_json_formatter). logrus&#039;s message json formatter with human-readable caption added.

You can define your formatter by implementing the `Formatter` interface,
requiring a `Format` method. `Format` takes an `*Entry`. `entry.Data` is a
`Fields` type (`map[string]interface{}`) with all your fields as well as the
default ones (see Entries section above):

```go
type MyJSONFormatter struct {
}

log.SetFormatter(new(MyJSONFormatter))

func (f *MyJSONFormatter) Format(entry *Entry) ([]byte, error) {
  // Note this doesn&#039;t include Time, Level and Message which are available on
  // the Entry. Consult `godoc` on information about those fields or read the
  // source of the official loggers.
  serialized, err := json.Marshal(entry.Data)
    if err != nil {
      return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;Failed to marshal fields to JSON, %w&quot;, err)
    }
  return append(serialized, &#039;\n&#039;), nil
}
```

#### Logger as an `io.Writer`

Logrus can be transformed into an `io.Writer`. That writer is the end of an `io.Pipe` and it is your responsibility to close it.

```go
w := logger.Writer()
defer w.Close()

srv := http.Server{
    // create a stdlib log.Logger that writes to
    // logrus.Logger.
    ErrorLog: log.New(w, &quot;&quot;, 0),
}
```

Each line written to that writer will be printed the usual way, using formatters
and hooks. The level for those entries is `info`.

This means that we can override the standard library logger easily:

```go
logger := logrus.New()
logger.Formatter = &amp;logrus.JSONFormatter{}

// Use logrus for standard log output
// Note that `log` here references stdlib&#039;s log
// Not logrus imported under the name `log`.
log.SetOutput(logger.Writer())
```

#### Rotation

Log rotation is not provided with Logrus. Log rotation should be done by an
external program (like `logrotate(8)`) that can compress and delete old log
entries. It should not be a feature of the application-level logger.

#### Tools

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
|[Logrus Mate](https://github.com/gogap/logrus_mate)|Logrus mate is a tool for Logrus to manage loggers, you can initial logger&#039;s level, hook and formatter by config file, the logger will be generated with different configs in different environments.|
|[Logrus Viper Helper](https://github.com/heirko/go-contrib/tree/master/logrusHelper)|An Helper around Logrus to wrap with spf13/Viper to load configuration with fangs! And to simplify Logrus configuration use some behavior of [Logrus Mate](https://github.com/gogap/logrus_mate). [sample](https://github.com/heirko/iris-contrib/blob/master/middleware/logrus-logger/example) |

#### Testing

Logrus has a built in facility for asserting the presence of log messages. This is implemented through the `test` hook and provides:

* decorators for existing logger (`test.NewLocal` and `test.NewGlobal`) which basically just adds the `test` hook
* a test logger (`test.NewNullLogger`) that just records log messages (and does not output any):

```go
import(
  &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;
  &quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus/hooks/test&quot;
  &quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
  &quot;testing&quot;
)

func TestSomething(t*testing.T){
  logger, hook := test.NewNullLogger()
  logger.Error(&quot;Helloerror&quot;)

  assert.Equal(t, 1, len(hook.Entries))
  assert.Equal(t, logrus.ErrorLevel, hook.LastEntry().Level)
  assert.Equal(t, &quot;Helloerror&quot;, hook.LastEntry().Message)

  hook.Reset()
  assert.Nil(t, hook.LastEntry())
}
```

#### Fatal handlers

Logrus can register one or more functions that will be called when any `fatal`
level message is logged. The registered handlers will be executed before
logrus performs an `os.Exit(1)`. This behavior may be helpful if callers need
to gracefully shutdown. Unlike a `panic(&quot;Something went wrong...&quot;)` call which can be intercepted with a deferred `recover` a call to `os.Exit(1)` can not be intercepted.

```
...
handler := func() {
  // gracefully shutdown something...
}
logrus.RegisterExitHandler(handler)
...
```

#### Thread safety

By default, Logger is protected by a mutex for concurrent writes. The mutex is held when calling hooks and writing logs.
If you are sure such locking is not needed, you can call logger.SetNoLock() to disable the locking.

Situation when locking is not needed includes:

* You have no hooks registered, or hooks calling is already thread-safe.

* Writing to logger.Out is already thread-safe, for example:

  1) logger.Out is protected by locks.

  2) logger.Out is an os.File handler opened with `O_APPEND` flag, and every write is smaller than 4k. (This allows multi-thread/multi-process writing)

# KubeRay

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/workflows/Go-build-and-test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/actions)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ray-project/kuberay)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ray-project/kuberay)

KubeRay is a powerful, open-source Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) applications on Kubernetes. It offers several key components:

**KubeRay core**: This is the official, fully-maintained component of KubeRay that provides three custom resource definitions, RayCluster, RayJob, and RayService. These resources are designed to help you run a wide range of workloads with ease.

* **RayCluster**: KubeRay fully manages the lifecycle of RayCluster, including cluster creation/deletion, autoscaling, and ensuring fault tolerance.

* **RayJob**: With RayJob, KubeRay automatically creates a RayCluster and submits a job when the cluster is ready. You can also configure RayJob to automatically delete the RayCluster once the job finishes.

* **RayService**: RayService is made up of two parts: a RayCluster and a Ray Serve deployment graph. RayService offers zero-downtime upgrades for RayCluster and high availability.

**KubeRay ecosystem**: Some optional components.

* **Kubectl Plugin** (Beta): Starting from KubeRay v1.3.0, you can use the `kubectl ray` plugin to simplify
common workflows when deploying Ray on Kubernetes. If you aren’t familiar with Kubernetes, this
plugin simplifies running Ray on Kubernetes. See [kubectl-plugin](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/user-guides/kubectl-plugin.html#kubectl-plugin) for more details.

* **KubeRay APIServer** (Alpha): It provides a layer of simplified configuration for KubeRay resources. The KubeRay API server is used internally
by some organizations to back user interfaces for KubeRay resource management.

* **KubeRay Dashboard** (Experimental): Starting from KubeRay v1.4.0, we have introduced a new dashboard that enables users to view and manage KubeRay resources.
While it is not yet production-ready, we welcome your feedback.

## Documentation

From September 2023, all user-facing KubeRay documentation will be hosted on the [Ray documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html).
The KubeRay repository only contains documentation related to the development and maintenance of KubeRay.

## Quick Start

* [RayCluster Quickstart](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started/raycluster-quick-start.html)
* [RayJob Quickstart](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started/rayjob-quick-start.html)
* [RayService Quickstart](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started/rayservice-quick-start.html)

## Examples

KubeRay examples are hosted on the [Ray documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/examples.html).
Examples span a wide range of use cases, including training, LLM online inference, batch inference, and more.

## Kubernetes Ecosystem

KubeRay integrates with the Kubernetes ecosystem, including observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, py-spy), queuing systems (e.g., Volcano, Apache YuniKorn, Kueue), ingress controllers (e.g., Nginx), and more.
See [KubeRay Ecosystem](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/k8s-ecosystem.html) for more details.
