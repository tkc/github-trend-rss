#### [News](https://fleetdm.com/announcements) &amp;nbsp; · &amp;nbsp; [Report a bug](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new) &amp;nbsp; · &amp;nbsp; [Handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) &amp;nbsp; · &amp;nbsp; [Why open source?](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source) &amp;nbsp; · &amp;nbsp; [Art](https://fleetdm.com/logos)


Open-source platform for IT and security teams with thousands of computers.  Designed for APIs, GitOps, webhooks, YAML, and humans.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://fleetdm.com/logos&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/assets/618009/f835ec29-1cb9-49ba-a0f3-395ffd9d5c9f&quot; alt=&quot;A glass city in the clouds&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


## What&#039;s it for?
Organizations like Fastly and Gusto use Fleet for vulnerability reporting, detection engineering, device management (MDM), device health monitoring, posture-based access control, managing unused software licenses, and more.

#### Explore data
To see what kind of data you can use Fleet to gather, check out the [table reference documentation](https://fleetdm.com/tables).

#### Out-of-the-box policies
Fleet includes out-of-the box support for all [CIS benchmarks for macOS and Windows](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/cis-benchmarks), as well as many [simpler queries](https://fleetdm.com/queries).

Take as much or as little as you need for your organization.

#### Supported platforms
Here are the platforms Fleet currently supports:

- Linux (all distros)
- macOS
- Windows
- Chromebooks
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud (GCP)
- Azure (Microsoft cloud)
- Data centers
- Containers (kube, etc)
- Linux-based IoT devices

## Lighter than air
Fleet is lightweight and modular.  You can use it for security without using it for MDM, and vice versa.  You can turn off features you are not using.

#### Openness
Fleet is dedicated to flexibility, accessibility, and clarity.  We think [everyone can contribute](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#openness) and that tools should be as easy as possible for everyone to understand.

#### Good neighbors
Fleet has no ambition to replace all of your other tools.  (Though it might replace some, if you want it to.)  Ready-to-use, enterprise-friendly integrations exist for Snowflake, Splunk, GitHub Actions, Vanta, Elastic Jira, Zendesk, and more.

Fleet plays well with Munki, Chef, Puppet, and Ansible, as well as with security tools like Crowdstrike and SentinelOne.  For example, you can use the free version of Fleet to quickly report on what hosts are _actually_ running your EDR agent.

#### Free as in free
The free version of Fleet will [always be free](https://fleetdm.com/pricing).  Fleet is [independently backed](https://linkedin.com/company/fleetdm) and actively maintained with the help of many amazing [contributors](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors).

#### Longevity
The [company behind Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) is founded (and majority-owned) by [true believers in open source](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source).  The company&#039;s business model is influenced by GitLab (NYSE: GTLB), with great investors, happy customers, and the capacity to become profitable at any time.

In keeping with Fleet&#039;s value of openness, [Fleet Device Management&#039;s company handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) is public and open source.  You can read about the [history of Fleet and osquery](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#history) and our commitment to improving the product.

&lt;!-- &gt; To upgrade from Fleet ≤3.2.0, just follow the upgrading steps for the earliest subsequent major release from this repository (it&#039;ll work out of the box until the release of Fleet 5.0). --&gt;


## Is it any good?
Fleet is used in production by IT and security teams with thousands of laptops and servers.  Many deployments support tens of thousands of hosts, and a few large organizations manage deployments as large as 400,000+ hosts.



## Chat
Please join us in [MacAdmins Slack](https://www.macadmins.org/) or in [osquery Slack](https://fleetdm.com/slack).

## Updates

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; February 24, 2025
&gt;
&gt; - Fabric now supports Sonnet 3.7! Update and use `-S` to select it as your default if you want, or just use the shortcut `-m claude-3-7-sonnet-latest`. Enjoy!

## What and why

Since the start of 2023 and GenAI we&#039;ve seen a massive number of AI applications for accomplishing tasks. It&#039;s powerful, but _it&#039;s not easy to integrate this functionality into our lives._

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In other words, AI doesn&#039;t have a capabilities problem—it has an &lt;em&gt;integration&lt;/em&gt; problem.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Fabric was created to address this by enabling everyone to granularly apply AI to everyday challenges.

## Intro videos

Keep in mind that many of these were recorded when Fabric was Python-based, so remember to use the current [install instructions](#installation) below.

- [David Bombal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-MQmVxnCs)
- [My Own Intro to the Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPEyyigh10g)
- [More Fabric YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fabric+ai)

## Philosophy

&gt; AI isn&#039;t a thing; it&#039;s a _magnifier_ of a thing. And that thing is **human creativity**.

We believe the purpose of technology is to help humans flourish, so when we talk about AI we start with the **human** problems we want to solve.

### Breaking problems into components

Our approach is to break problems into individual pieces (see below) and then apply AI to them one at a time. See below for some examples.

&lt;img width=&quot;2078&quot; alt=&quot;augmented_challenges&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/assets/50654/31997394-85a9-40c2-879b-b347e4701f06&quot;&gt;

### Too many prompts

Prompts are good for this, but the biggest challenge I faced in 2023——which still exists today—is **the sheer number of AI prompts out there**. We all have prompts that are useful, but it&#039;s hard to discover new ones, know if they are good or not, _and manage different versions of the ones we like_.

One of `fabric`&#039;s primary features is helping people collect and integrate prompts, which we call _Patterns_, into various parts of their lives.

Fabric has Patterns for all sorts of life and work activities, including:

- Extracting the most interesting parts of YouTube videos and podcasts
- Writing an essay in your own voice with just an idea as an input
- Summarizing opaque academic papers
- Creating perfectly matched AI art prompts for a piece of writing
- Rating the quality of content to see if you want to read/watch the whole thing
- Getting summaries of long, boring content
- Explaining code to you
- Turning bad documentation into usable documentation
- Creating social media posts from any content input
- And a million more…

## Installation

To install Fabric, you can use the latest release binaries or install it from the source.

### Get Latest Release Binaries

#### Windows

`https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-windows-amd64.exe`

#### macOS (arm64)

`curl -L https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-darwin-arm64 &gt; fabric &amp;&amp; chmod +x fabric &amp;&amp; ./fabric --version`

#### macOS (amd64)

`curl -L https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-darwin-amd64 &gt; fabric &amp;&amp; chmod +x fabric &amp;&amp; ./fabric --version`

#### Linux (amd64)

`curl -L https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-linux-amd64 &gt; fabric &amp;&amp; chmod +x fabric &amp;&amp; ./fabric --version`

#### Linux (arm64)

`curl -L https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest/download/fabric-linux-arm64 &gt; fabric &amp;&amp; chmod +x fabric &amp;&amp; ./fabric --version`

### Using package managers

**NOTE:** using Homebrew or the Arch Linux package managers makes `fabric` available as `fabric-ai`, so add
the following alias to your shell startup files to account for this:

```bash
alias fabric=&#039;fabric-ai&#039;
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

`brew install fabric-ai`

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

`yay -S fabric-ai`

### From Source

To install Fabric, [make sure Go is installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), and then run the following command.

```bash
# Install Fabric directly from the repo
go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest
```

### Environment Variables

You may need to set some environment variables in your `~/.bashrc` on linux or `~/.zshrc` file on mac to be able to run the `fabric` command. Here is an example of what you can add:

For Intel based macs or linux

```bash
# Golang environment variables
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go

# Update PATH to include GOPATH and GOROOT binaries
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

for Apple Silicon based macs

```bash
# Golang environment variables
export GOROOT=$(brew --prefix go)/libexec
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

### Setup

Now run the following command

```bash
# Run the setup to set up your directories and keys
fabric --setup
```

If everything works you are good to go.

### Add aliases for all patterns

In order to add aliases for all your patterns and use them directly as commands ie. `summarize` instead of `fabric --pattern summarize`
You can add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.

```bash
# Loop through all files in the ~/.config/fabric/patterns directory
for pattern_file in $HOME/.config/fabric/patterns/*; do
    # Get the base name of the file (i.e., remove the directory path)
    pattern_name=$(basename &quot;$pattern_file&quot;)

    # Create an alias in the form: alias pattern_name=&quot;fabric --pattern pattern_name&quot;
    alias_command=&quot;alias $pattern_name=&#039;fabric --pattern $pattern_name&#039;&quot;

    # Evaluate the alias command to add it to the current shell
    eval &quot;$alias_command&quot;
done

yt() {
    if [ &quot;$#&quot; -eq 0 ] || [ &quot;$#&quot; -gt 2 ]; then
        echo &quot;Usage: yt [-t | --timestamps] youtube-link&quot;
        echo &quot;Use the &#039;-t&#039; flag to get the transcript with timestamps.&quot;
        return 1
    fi

    transcript_flag=&quot;--transcript&quot;
    if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;-t&quot; ] || [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;--timestamps&quot; ]; then
        transcript_flag=&quot;--transcript-with-timestamps&quot;
        shift
    fi
    local video_link=&quot;$1&quot;
    fabric -y &quot;$video_link&quot; $transcript_flag
}
```

You can add the below code for the equivalent aliases inside PowerShell by running `notepad $PROFILE` inside a PowerShell window:

```powershell
# Path to the patterns directory
$patternsPath = Join-Path $HOME &quot;.config/fabric/patterns&quot;
foreach ($patternDir in Get-ChildItem -Path $patternsPath -Directory) {
    $patternName = $patternDir.Name

    # Dynamically define a function for each pattern
    $functionDefinition = @&quot;
function $patternName {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline = `$true)]
        [string] `$InputObject,

        [Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments = `$true)]
        [String[]] `$patternArgs
    )

    begin {
        # Initialize an array to collect pipeline input
        `$collector = @()
    }

    process {
        # Collect pipeline input objects
        if (`$InputObject) {
            `$collector += `$InputObject
        }
    }

    end {
        # Join all pipeline input into a single string, separated by newlines
        `$pipelineContent = `$collector -join &quot;`n&quot;

        # If there&#039;s pipeline input, include it in the call to fabric
        if (`$pipelineContent) {
            `$pipelineContent | fabric --pattern $patternName `$patternArgs
        } else {
            # No pipeline input; just call fabric with the additional args
            fabric --pattern $patternName `$patternArgs
        }
    }
}
&quot;@
    # Add the function to the current session
    Invoke-Expression $functionDefinition
}

# Define the &#039;yt&#039; function as well
function yt {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter()]
        [Alias(&quot;timestamps&quot;)]
        [switch]$t,

        [Parameter(Position = 0, ValueFromPipeline = $true)]
        [string]$videoLink
    )

    begin {
        $transcriptFlag = &quot;--transcript&quot;
        if ($t) {
            $transcriptFlag = &quot;--transcript-with-timestamps&quot;
        }
    }

    process {
        if (-not $videoLink) {
            Write-Error &quot;Usage: yt [-t | --timestamps] youtube-link&quot;
            return
        }
    }

    end {
        if ($videoLink) {
            # Execute and allow output to flow through the pipeline
            fabric -y $videoLink $transcriptFlag
        }
    }
}
```

This also creates a `yt` alias that allows you to use `yt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b0iet22VIk` to get transcripts, comments, and metadata.

#### Save your files in markdown using aliases

If in addition to the above aliases you would like to have the option to save the output to your favorite markdown note vault like Obsidian then instead of the above add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```bash
# Define the base directory for Obsidian notes
obsidian_base=&quot;/path/to/obsidian&quot;

# Loop through all files in the ~/.config/fabric/patterns directory
for pattern_file in ~/.config/fabric/patterns/*; do
    # Get the base name of the file (i.e., remove the directory path)
    pattern_name=$(basename &quot;$pattern_file&quot;)

    # Remove any existing alias with the same name
    unalias &quot;$pattern_name&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null

    # Define a function dynamically for each pattern
    eval &quot;
    $pattern_name() {
        local title=\$1
        local date_stamp=\$(date +&#039;%Y-%m-%d&#039;)
        local output_path=\&quot;\$obsidian_base/\${date_stamp}-\${title}.md\&quot;

        # Check if a title was provided
        if [ -n \&quot;\$title\&quot; ]; then
            # If a title is provided, use the output path
            fabric --pattern \&quot;$pattern_name\&quot; -o \&quot;\$output_path\&quot;
        else
            # If no title is provided, use --stream
            fabric --pattern \&quot;$pattern_name\&quot; --stream
        fi
    }
    &quot;
done
```

This will allow you to use the patterns as aliases like in the above for example `summarize` instead of `fabric --pattern summarize --stream`, however if you pass in an extra argument like this `summarize &quot;my_article_title&quot;` your output will be saved in the destination that you set in `obsidian_base=&quot;/path/to/obsidian&quot;` in the following format `YYYY-MM-DD-my_article_title.md` where the date gets autogenerated for you.
You can tweak the date format by tweaking the `date_stamp` format.

### Migration

If you have the Legacy (Python) version installed and want to migrate to the Go version, here&#039;s how you do it. It&#039;s basically two steps: 1) uninstall the Python version, and 2) install the Go version.

```bash
# Uninstall Legacy Fabric
pipx uninstall fabric

# Clear any old Fabric aliases
(check your .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
# Install the Go version
go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest
# Run setup for the new version. Important because things have changed
fabric --setup
```

Then [set your environmental variables](#environment-variables) as shown above.

### Upgrading

The great thing about Go is that it&#039;s super easy to upgrade. Just run the same command you used to install it in the first place and you&#039;ll always get the latest version.

```bash
go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest
```

## Usage

Once you have it all set up, here&#039;s how to use it.

```bash
fabric -h
```

```bash

## Our approach to prompting

Fabric _Patterns_ are different than most prompts you&#039;ll see.

- **First, we use `Markdown` to help ensure maximum readability and editability**. This not only helps the creator make a good one, but also anyone who wants to deeply understand what it does. _Importantly, this also includes the AI you&#039;re sending it to!_

Here&#039;s an example of a Fabric Pattern.

```bash
https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/extract_wisdom/system.md
```

&lt;img width=&quot;1461&quot; alt=&quot;pattern-example&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/assets/50654/b910c551-9263-405f-9735-71ca69bbab6d&quot;&gt;

- **Next, we are extremely clear in our instructions**, and we use the Markdown structure to emphasize what we want the AI to do, and in what order.

- **And finally, we tend to use the System section of the prompt almost exclusively**. In over a year of being heads-down with this stuff, we&#039;ve just seen more efficacy from doing that. If that changes, or we&#039;re shown data that says otherwise, we will adjust.

## Examples

&gt; The following examples use the macOS `pbpaste` to paste from the clipboard. See the [pbpaste](#pbpaste) section below for Windows and Linux alternatives.

Now let&#039;s look at some things you can do with Fabric.

1. Run the `summarize` Pattern based on input from `stdin`. In this case, the body of an article.

    ```bash
    pbpaste | fabric --pattern summarize
    ```

2. Run the `analyze_claims` Pattern with the `--stream` option to get immediate and streaming results.

    ```bash
    pbpaste | fabric --stream --pattern analyze_claims
    ```

3. Run the `extract_wisdom` Pattern with the `--stream` option to get immediate and streaming results from any      Youtube video (much like in the original introduction video).

    ```bash
    fabric -y &quot;https://youtube.com/watch?v=uXs-zPc63kM&quot; --stream --pattern extract_wisdom
    ```

4. Create patterns- you must create a .md file with the pattern and save it to `~/.config

    )

    // Add tool

        mcp.WithDescription(&quot;Say hello to someone&quot;),
        mcp.WithString(&quot;name&quot;,
            mcp.Required(),

        ),
    )

    // Add tool handler
    s.AddTool(tool, helloHandler)

    // Start the stdio server
    if err := server.ServeStdio(s); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf(&quot;Server error: %v\n&quot;, err)
    }
}

func helloHandler(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    name, ok := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;name&quot;].(string)
    if !ok {
        return nil, errors.New(&quot;name must be a string&quot;)
    }

    return mcp.NewToolResultText(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Hello, %s!&quot;, name)), nil
}
```

That&#039;s it!

MCP Go handles all the complex protocol details and server management, so you can focus on building great tools. It aims to be high-level and easy to use.

### Key features:
* **Fast**: High-level interface means less code and faster development
* **Simple**: Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate
* **Complete***: MCP Go aims to provide a full implementation of the core MCP specification

(\*emphasis on *aims*)

🚨 🚧 🏗️ *MCP Go is under active development, as is the MCP specification itself. Core features are working but some advanced capabilities are still in progress.*

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go
```

## Quickstart

Let&#039;s create a simple MCP server that exposes a calculator tool and some data:

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;context&quot;
    &quot;errors&quot;
    &quot;fmt&quot;

    &quot;github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/mcp&quot;
    &quot;github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/server&quot;
)

func main() {
    // Create a new MCP server
    s := server.NewMCPServer(
        &quot;Calculator Demo&quot;,
        &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
        server.WithResourceCapabilities(true, true),
        server.WithLogging(),
    )

    // Add a calculator tool
    calculatorTool := mcp.NewTool(&quot;calculate&quot;,
        mcp.WithDescription(&quot;Perform basic arithmetic operations&quot;),
        mcp.WithString(&quot;operation&quot;,
            mcp.Required(),
            mcp.Description(&quot;The operation to perform (add, subtract, multiply, divide)&quot;),
            mcp.Enum(&quot;add&quot;, &quot;subtract&quot;, &quot;multiply&quot;, &quot;divide&quot;),
        ),
        mcp.WithNumber(&quot;x&quot;,
            mcp.Required(),
            mcp.Description(&quot;First number&quot;),
        ),
        mcp.WithNumber(&quot;y&quot;,
            mcp.Required(),
            mcp.Description(&quot;Second number&quot;),
        ),
    )

    // Add the calculator handler
    s.AddTool(calculatorTool, func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
        op := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;operation&quot;].(string)
        x := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;x&quot;].(float64)
        y := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;y&quot;].(float64)

        var result float64
        switch op {
        case &quot;add&quot;:
            result = x + y
        case &quot;subtract&quot;:
            result = x - y
        case &quot;multiply&quot;:
            result = x * y
        case &quot;divide&quot;:
            if y == 0 {
                return nil, errors.New(&quot;Cannot divide by zero&quot;)
            }
            result = x / y
        }

        return mcp.NewToolResultText(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%.2f&quot;, result)), nil
    })

    // Start the server
    if err := server.ServeStdio(s); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf(&quot;Server error: %v\n&quot;, err)
    }
}
```
## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM&#039;s context)
- Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!


## Core Concepts


### Server

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Show Server Examples&lt;/summary&gt;

The server is your core interface to the MCP protocol. It handles connection management, protocol compliance, and message routing:

```go
// Create a basic server
s := server.NewMCPServer(
    &quot;My Server&quot;,  // Server name
    &quot;1.0.0&quot;,     // Version
)

// Start the server using stdio
if err := server.ServeStdio(s); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf(&quot;Server error: %v&quot;, err)
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Resources

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Show Resource Examples&lt;/summary&gt;
Resources are how you expose data to LLMs. They can be anything - files, API responses, database queries, system information, etc. Resources can be:

- Static (fixed URI)
- Dynamic (using URI templates)

Here&#039;s a simple example of a static resource:

```go
// Static resource example - exposing a README file
resource := mcp.NewResource(
    &quot;docs://readme&quot;,
    &quot;Project README&quot;,
    mcp.WithResourceDescription(&quot;The project&#039;s README file&quot;), 
    mcp.WithMIMEType(&quot;text/markdown&quot;),
)

// Add resource with its handler
s.AddResource(resource, func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.ReadResourceRequest) ([]mcp.ResourceContents, error) {
    content, err := os.ReadFile(&quot;README.md&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    return []mcp.ResourceContents{
        mcp.TextResourceContents{
            URI:      &quot;docs://readme&quot;,
            MIMEType: &quot;text/markdown&quot;,
            Text:     string(content),
        },
    }, nil
})
```

And here&#039;s an example of a dynamic resource using a template:

```go
// Dynamic resource example - user profiles by ID
template := mcp.NewResourceTemplate(
    &quot;users://{id}/profile&quot;,
    &quot;User Profile&quot;,
    mcp.WithTemplateDescription(&quot;Returns user profile information&quot;),
    mcp.WithTemplateMIMEType(&quot;application/json&quot;),
)

// Add template with its handler
s.AddResourceTemplate(template, func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.ReadResourceRequest) ([]mcp.ResourceContents, error) {
    // Extract ID from the URI using regex matching
    // The server automatically matches URIs to templates
    userID := extractIDFromURI(request.Params.URI)
    
    profile, err := getUserProfile(userID)  // Your DB/API call here
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    return []mcp.ResourceContents{
        mcp.TextResourceContents{
            URI:      request.Params.URI,
            MIMEType: &quot;application/json&quot;,
            Text:     profile,
        },
    }, nil
})
```

The examples are simple but demonstrate the core concepts. Resources can be much more sophisticated - serving multiple contents, integrating with databases or external APIs, etc.
&lt;/details&gt;

### Tools

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Show Tool Examples&lt;/summary&gt;

Tools let LLMs take actions through your server. Unlike resources, tools are expected to perform computation and have side effects. They&#039;re similar to POST endpoints in a REST API.

Simple calculation example:
```go
calculatorTool := mcp.NewTool(&quot;calculate&quot;,
    mcp.WithDescription(&quot;Perform basic arithmetic calculations&quot;),
    mcp.WithString(&quot;operation&quot;,
        mcp.Required(),
        mcp.Description(&quot;The arithmetic operation to perform&quot;),
        mcp.Enum(&quot;add&quot;, &quot;subtract&quot;, &quot;multiply&quot;, &quot;divide&quot;),
    ),
    mcp.WithNumber(&quot;x&quot;,
        mcp.Required(),
        mcp.Description(&quot;First number&quot;),
    ),
    mcp.WithNumber(&quot;y&quot;,
        mcp.Required(),
        mcp.Description(&quot;Second number&quot;),
    ),
)

s.AddTool(calculatorTool, func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    op := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;operation&quot;].(string)
    x := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;x&quot;].(float64)
    y := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;y&quot;].(float64)

    var result float64
    switch op {
    case &quot;add&quot;:
        result = x + y
    case &quot;subtract&quot;:
        result = x - y
    case &quot;multiply&quot;:
        result = x * y
    case &quot;divide&quot;:
        if y == 0 {
            return nil, errors.New(&quot;Division by zero is not allowed&quot;)
        }
        result = x / y
    }
    
    return mcp.FormatNumberResult(result), nil
})
```

HTTP request example:
```go
httpTool := mcp.NewTool(&quot;http_request&quot;,
    mcp.WithDescription(&quot;Make HTTP requests to external APIs&quot;),
    mcp.WithString(&quot;method&quot;,
        mcp.Required(),
        mcp.Description(&quot;HTTP method to use&quot;),
        mcp.Enum(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;, &quot;PUT&quot;, &quot;DELETE&quot;),
    ),
    mcp.WithString(&quot;url&quot;,
        mcp.Required(),
        mcp.Description(&quot;URL to send the request to&quot;),
        mcp.Pattern(&quot;^https?://.*&quot;),
    ),
    mcp.WithString(&quot;body&quot;,
        mcp.Description(&quot;Request body (for POST/PUT)&quot;),
    ),
)

s.AddTool(httpTool, func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    method := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;method&quot;].(string)
    url := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;url&quot;].(string)
    body := &quot;&quot;
    if b, ok := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;body&quot;].(string); ok {
        body = b
    }

    // Create and send request
    var req *http.Request
    var err error
    if body != &quot;&quot; {
        req, err = http.NewRequest(method, url, strings.NewReader(body))
    } else {
        req, err = http.NewRequest(method, url, nil)
    }
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;Failed to create request: %v&quot;, err)
    }

    client := &amp;http.Client{}
    resp, err := client.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;Request failed: %v&quot;, err)
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Return response
    respBody, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;Failed to read response: %v&quot;, err)
    }

    return mcp.NewToolResultText(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Status: %d\nBody: %s&quot;, resp.StatusCode, string(respBody))), nil
})
```

Tools can be used for any kind of computation or side effect:
- Database queries
- File operations  
- External API calls
- Calculations
- System operations

Each tool should:
- Have a clear description
- Validate inputs
- Handle errors gracefully 
- Return structured responses
- Use appropriate result types

&lt;/details&gt;

### Prompts

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Show Prompt Examples&lt;/summary&gt;

Prompts are reusable templates that help LLMs interact with your server effectively. They&#039;re like &quot;best practices&quot; encoded into your server. Here are some examples:

```go
// Simple greeting prompt
s.AddPrompt(mcp.NewPrompt(&quot;greeting&quot;,
    mcp.WithPromptDescription(&quot;A friendly greeting prompt&quot;),
    mcp.WithArgument(&quot;name&quot;,
        mcp.ArgumentDescription(&quot;Name of the person to greet&quot;),
    ),
), func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.GetPromptRequest) (*mcp.GetPromptResult, error) {
    name := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;name&quot;]
    if name == &quot;&quot; {
        name = &quot;friend&quot;
    }
    
    return mcp.NewGetPromptResult(
        &quot;A friendly greeting&quot;,
        []mcp.PromptMessage{
            mcp.NewPromptMessage(
                mcp.RoleAssistant,
                mcp.NewTextContent(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Hello, %s! How can I help you today?&quot;, name)),
            ),
        },
    ), nil
})

// Code review prompt with embedded resource
s.AddPrompt(mcp.NewPrompt(&quot;code_review&quot;,
    mcp.WithPromptDescription(&quot;Code review assistance&quot;),
    mcp.WithArgument(&quot;pr_number&quot;,
        mcp.ArgumentDescription(&quot;Pull request number to review&quot;),
        mcp.RequiredArgument(),
    ),
), func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.GetPromptRequest) (*mcp.GetPromptResult, error) {
    prNumber := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;pr_number&quot;]
    if prNumber == &quot;&quot; {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;pr_number is required&quot;)
    }
    
    return mcp.NewGetPromptResult(
        &quot;Code review assistance&quot;,
        []mcp.PromptMessage{
            mcp.NewPromptMessage(
                mcp.RoleSystem,
                mcp.NewTextContent(&quot;You are a helpful code reviewer. Review the changes and provide constructive feedback.&quot;),
            ),
            mcp.NewPromptMessage(
                mcp.RoleAssistant,
                mcp.NewEmbeddedResource(mcp.ResourceContents{
                    URI: fmt.Sprintf(&quot;git://pulls/%s/diff&quot;, prNumber),
                    MIMEType: &quot;text/x-diff&quot;,
                }),
            ),
        },
    ), nil
})

// Database query builder prompt
s.AddPrompt(mcp.NewPrompt(&quot;query_builder&quot;,
    mcp.WithPromptDescription(&quot;SQL query builder assistance&quot;),
    mcp.WithArgument(&quot;table&quot;,
        mcp.ArgumentDescription(&quot;Name of the table to query&quot;),
        mcp.RequiredArgument(),
    ),
), func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.GetPromptRequest) (*mcp.GetPromptResult, error) {
    tableName := request.Params.Arguments[&quot;table&quot;]
    if tableName == &quot;&quot; {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;table name is required&quot;)
    }
    
    return mcp.NewGetPromptResult(
        &quot;SQL query builder assistance&quot;,
        []mcp.PromptMessage{
            mcp.NewPromptMessage(
                mcp.RoleSystem,
                mcp.NewTextContent(&quot;You are a SQL expert. Help construct efficient and safe queries.&quot;),
            ),
            mcp.NewPromptMessage(
                mcp.RoleAssistant,
                mcp.NewEmbeddedResource(mcp.ResourceContents{
                    URI: fmt.Sprintf(&quot;db://schema/%s&quot;, tableName),
                    MIMEType: &quot;application/json&quot;,
                }),
            ),
        },
    ), nil
})
```

Prompts can include:
- System instructions
- Required arguments
- Embedded resources
- Multiple messages
- Different content types (text, images, etc.)
- Custom URI schemes

&lt;/details&gt;

## Examples

For examples, see the `examples/` directory.

## Extras

### Request Hooks

Hook into the request lifecycle by creating a `Hooks` object with your
selection among the possible callbacks.  This enables telemetry across all
functionality, and observability of various facts, for example the ability
to count improperly-formatted requests, or to log the agent identity during
initialization.

Add the `Hooks` to the server at the time of creation using the
`server.WithHooks` option.

**LocalAI** is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that’s compatible with OpenAI (Elevenlabs, Anthropic... ) API specifications for local AI inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families. Does not require GPU. It is created and maintained by [Ettore Di Giacinto](https://github.com/mudler).

## Quickstart

Run the installer script:

```bash
curl https://localai.io/install.sh | sh
```

Or run with docker:
```bash
# CPU only image:
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 localai/localai:latest-cpu

# Nvidia GPU:
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 --gpus all localai/localai:latest-gpu-nvidia-cuda-12

# CPU and GPU image (bigger size):
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 localai/localai:latest

# AIO images (it will pre-download a set of models ready for use, see https://localai.io/basics/container/)
docker run -ti --name local-ai -p 8080:8080 localai/localai:latest-aio-cpu
```

To load models:

```bash
# From the model gallery (see available models with `local-ai models list`, in the WebUI from the model tab, or visiting https://models.localai.io)
local-ai run llama-3.2-1b-instruct:q4_k_m
# Start LocalAI with the phi-2 model directly from huggingface
local-ai run huggingface://TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF/phi-2.Q8_0.gguf
# Install and run a model from the Ollama OCI registry
local-ai run ollama://gemma:2b
# Run a model from a configuration file
local-ai run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/.../phi-2.yaml
# Install and run a model from a standard OCI registry (e.g., Docker Hub)
local-ai run oci://localai/phi-2:latest
```

Higress is a cloud-native API gateway based on Istio and Envoy, which can be extended with Wasm plugins written in Go/Rust/JS. It provides dozens of ready-to-use general-purpose plugins and an out-of-the-box console (try the [demo here](http://demo.higress.io/)).

Higress was born within Alibaba to solve the issues of Tengine reload affecting long-connection services and insufficient load balancing capabilities for gRPC/Dubbo.

Alibaba Cloud has built its cloud-native API gateway product based on Higress, providing 99.99% gateway high availability guarantee service capabilities for a large number of enterprise customers.

Higress&#039;s AI gateway capabilities support all [mainstream model providers](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/tree/main/plugins/wasm-go/extensions/ai-proxy/provider) both domestic and international, as well as self-built DeepSeek models based on vllm/ollama. Within Alibaba Cloud, it supports AI businesses such as Tongyi Qianwen APP, Bailian large model API, and machine learning PAI platform. It also serves leading AIGC enterprises (such as Zero One Infinite) and AI products (such as FastGPT).

- [**Feature Showcase**](#feature-showcase)
- [**Use Cases**](#use-cases)
- [**Core Advantages**](#core-advantages)
- [**Community**](#community)

## Quick Start

Higress can be started with just Docker, making it convenient for individual developers to set up locally for learning or for building simple sites:

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir higress; cd higress
# Start higress, configuration files will be written to the working directory
docker run -d --rm --name higress-ai -v ${PWD}:/data \
        -p 8001:8001 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443  \
        higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/higress/all-in-one:latest
```

Port descriptions:

- Port 8001: Higress UI console entry
- Port 8080: Gateway HTTP protocol entry
- Port 8443: Gateway HTTPS protocol entry

**All Higress Docker images use their own dedicated repository, unaffected by Docker Hub access restrictions in certain regions**

For other installation methods such as Helm deployment under K8s, please refer to the official [Quick Start documentation](https://higress.io/en-us/docs/user/quickstart).

## Use Cases

- **AI Gateway**:

  Higress can connect to all LLM model providers both domestic and international using a unified protocol, while also providing rich AI observability, multi-model load balancing/fallback, AI token rate limiting, AI caching, and other capabilities:

  ![](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01izmBNX1jbHT7lP3Yr_!!6000000004566-0-tps-1920-1080.jpg)

- **MCP Server Hosting**:

  Higress, as an Envoy-based API gateway, supports hosting MCP Servers through its plugin mechanism. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is essentially an AI-friendly API that enables AI Agents to more easily call various tools and services. Higress provides unified capabilities for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and observability for tool calls, simplifying the development and deployment of AI applications.

  ![](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN01wv8H4g1mS4MUzC1QC_!!6000000004952-2-tps-1764-597.png)

  By hosting MCP Servers with Higress, you can achieve:
  - Unified authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring the security of AI tool calls
  - Fine-grained rate limiting to prevent abuse and resource exhaustion
  - Comprehensive audit logs recording all tool call behaviors
  - Rich observability for monitoring the performance and health of tool calls
  - Simplified deployment and management through Higress&#039;s plugin mechanism for quickly adding new MCP Servers
  - Dynamic updates without disruption: Thanks to Envoy&#039;s friendly handling of long connections and Wasm plugin&#039;s dynamic update mechanism, MCP Server logic can be updated on-the-fly without any traffic disruption or connection drops

- **Kubernetes ingress controller**:

  Higress can function as a feature-rich ingress controller, which is compatible with many annotations of K8s&#039; nginx ingress controller.
  
  [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) support is coming soon and will support smooth migration from Ingress API to Gateway API.
  
- **Microservice gateway**:

  Higress can function as a microservice gateway, which can discovery microservices from various service registries, such as Nacos, ZooKeeper, Consul, Eureka, etc.
  
  It deeply integrates with [Dubbo](https://github.com/apache/dubbo), [Nacos](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos), [Sentinel](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel) and other microservice technology stacks.
  
- **Security gateway**:

  Higress can be used as a security gateway, supporting WAF and various authentication strategies, such as key-auth, hmac-auth, jwt-auth, basic-auth, oidc, etc.


## Core Advantages

- **Production Grade**

  Born from Alibaba&#039;s internal product with over 2 years of production validation, supporting large-scale scenarios with hundreds of thousands of requests per second.

  Completely eliminates traffic jitter caused by Nginx reload, configuration changes take effect in milliseconds and are transparent to business. Especially friendly to long-connection scenarios such as AI businesses.

- **Streaming Processing**

  Supports true complete streaming processing of request/response bodies, Wasm plugins can easily customize the handling of streaming protocols such as SSE (Server-Sent Events).

  In high-bandwidth scenarios such as AI businesses, it can significantly reduce memory overhead.
    
- **Easy to Extend**
  
  Provides a rich official plugin library covering AI, traffic management, security protection and other common functions, meeting more than 90% of business scenario requirements.

  Focuses on Wasm plugin extensions, ensuring memory safety through sandbox isolation, supporting multiple programming languages, allowing plugin versions to be upgraded independently, and achieving traffic-lossless hot updates of gateway logic.

- **Secure and Easy to Use**
  
  Based on Ingress API and Gateway API standards, provides out-of-the-box UI console, WAF protection plugin, IP/Cookie CC protection plugin ready to use.

  Supports connecting to Let&#039;s Encrypt for automatic issuance and renewal of free certificates, and can be deployed outside of K8s, started with a single Docker command, convenient for individual developers to use.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Domain list community

This project manages a list of domains, to be used as geosites for routing purpose in Project V.

## Purpose of this project

This project is not opinionated. In other words, it does NOT endorse, claim or imply that a domain should be blocked or proxied. It can be used to generate routing rules on demand.

## Download links

- **dlc.dat**：[https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat)
- **dlc.dat.sha256sum**：[https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat.sha256sum](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat.sha256sum)

## Usage example

Each file in the `data` directory can be used as a rule in this format: `geosite:filename`.

```json
&quot;routing&quot;: {
  &quot;domainStrategy&quot;: &quot;IPIfNonMatch&quot;,
  &quot;rules&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Reject&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-ads-all&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-porn&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Direct&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;domain:icloud.com&quot;,
        &quot;domain:icloud-content.com&quot;,
        &quot;domain:cdn-apple.com&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:cn&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:private&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-1&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-anticensorship&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-media&quot;,
        &quot;geosite:category-vpnservices&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-2&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:category-dev&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;field&quot;,
      &quot;outboundTag&quot;: &quot;Proxy-3&quot;,
      &quot;domain&quot;: [
        &quot;geosite:geolocation-!cn&quot;
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Generate `dlc.dat` manually

- Install `golang` and `git`
- Clone project code: `git clone https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community.git`
- Navigate to project root directory: `cd domain-list-community`
- Install project dependencies: `go mod download`
- Generate `dlc.dat` (without `datapath` option means to use domain lists in `data` directory of current working directory):
  - `go run ./`
  - `go run ./ --datapath=/path/to/your/custom/data/directory`

Run `go run ./ --help` for more usage information.

## Structure of data

All data are under `data` directory. Each file in the directory represents a sub-list of domains, named by the file name. File content is in the following format.

```
# comments
include:another-file
domain:google.com @attr1 @attr2
keyword:google
regexp:www\.google\.com$
full:www.google.com
```

**Syntax:**

&gt; The following types of rules are **NOT** fully compatible with the ones that defined by user in V2Ray config file. Do **Not** copy and paste directly.

* Comment begins with `#`. It may begin anywhere in the file. The content in the line after `#` is treated as comment and ignored in production.
* Inclusion begins with `include:`, followed by the file name of an existing file in the same directory.
* Subdomain begins with `domain:`, followed by a valid domain name. The prefix `domain:` may be omitted.
* Keyword begins with `keyword:`, followed by a string.
* Regular expression begins with `regexp:`, followed by a valid regular expression (per Golang&#039;s standard).
* Full domain begins with `full:`, followed by a complete and valid domain name.
* Domains (including `domain`, `keyword`, `regexp` and `full`) may have one or more attributes. Each attribute begins with `@` and followed by the name of the attribute.

&gt; **Note:** Adding new `regexp` and `keyword` rules is discouraged because it is easy to use them incorrectly, and proxy software cannot efficiently match these types of rules.

## How it works

The entire `data` directory will be built into an external `geosite` file for Project V. Each file in the directory represents a section in the generated file.

To generate a section:

1. Remove all the comments in the file.
2. Replace `include:` lines with the actual content of the file.
3. Omit all empty lines.
4. Generate each `domain:` line into a [sub-domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L21).
5. Generate each `keyword:` line into a [plain domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L17).
6. Generate each `regexp:` line into a [regex domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L19).
7. Generate each `full:` line into a [full domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/config.proto#L23).

## How to organize domains

### File name

Theoretically any string can be used as the name, as long as it is a valid file name. In practice, we prefer names for determinic group of domains, such as the owner (usually a company name) of the domains, e.g., &quot;google&quot;, &quot;netflix&quot;. Names with unclear scope are generally unrecommended, such as &quot;evil&quot;, or &quot;local&quot;.

### Attributes

Attribute is useful for sub-group of domains, especially for filtering purpose. For example, the list of `google` domains may contains its main domains, as well as domains that serve ads. The ads domains may be marked by attribute `@ads`, and can be used as `geosite:google@ads` in V2Ray routing.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>Mox is a modern full-featured open source secure mail server for low-maintenance self-hosted email.

For more details, see the mox website, https://www.xmox.nl.

See Quickstart below to get started.

## Features

- Quick and easy to start/maintain mail server, for your own domain(s).
- SMTP (with extensions) for receiving, submitting and delivering email.
- IMAP4 (with extensions) for giving email clients access to email.
- Webmail for reading/sending email from the browser.
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC for authenticating messages/delivery, also DMARC aggregate
  reports.
- Reputation tracking, learning (per user) host-, domain- and
  sender address-based reputation from (Non-)Junk email classification.
- Bayesian spam filtering that learns (per user) from (Non-)Junk email.
- Slowing down senders with no/low reputation or questionable email content
  (similar to greylisting). Rejected emails are stored in a mailbox called Rejects
  for a short period, helping with misclassified legitimate synchronous
  signup/login/transactional emails.
- Internationalized email (EIA), with unicode in email address usernames
  (&quot;localparts&quot;), and in domain names (IDNA).
- Automatic TLS with ACME, for use with Let&#039;s Encrypt and other CA&#039;s.
- DANE and MTA-STS for inbound and outbound delivery over SMTP with STARTTLS,
  including REQUIRETLS and with incoming/outgoing TLSRPT reporting.
- Web admin interface that helps you set up your domains, accounts and list
  aliases (instructions to create DNS records, configure
  SPF/DKIM/DMARC/TLSRPT/MTA-STS), for status information, and modifying the
  configuration file.
- Account autodiscovery (with SRV records, Microsoft-style, Thunderbird-style,
  and Apple device management profiles) for easy account setup (though client
  support is limited).
- Webserver with serving static files and forwarding requests (reverse
  proxy), so port 443 can also be used to serve websites.
- Simple HTTP/JSON API for sending transaction email and receiving delivery
  events and incoming messages (webapi and webhooks).
- Prometheus metrics and structured logging for operational insight.
- &quot;mox localserve&quot; subcommand for running mox locally for email-related
  testing/developing, including pedantic mode.
- Most non-server Go packages mox consists of are written to be reusable.

Mox is available under the MIT-license and was created by Mechiel Lukkien,
mechiel@ueber.net. Mox includes BSD-3-claused code from the Go Authors, and the
Public Suffix List by Mozilla under Mozilla Public License, v2.0.

Mox has automated tests, including for interoperability with Postfix for SMTP.
Mox is manually tested with email clients: Mozilla Thunderbird, mutt, iOS Mail,
macOS Mail, Android Mail, Microsoft Outlook. Mox is also manually tested to
interoperate with popular cloud providers: gmail.com, outlook.com, yahoo.com,
proton.me.

The code is heavily cross-referenced with the RFCs for readability/maintainability.

# Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with serving email for your domain is to get a
(virtual) machine dedicated to serving email, name it `[host].[domain]` (e.g.
mail.example.com). Having a DNSSEC-verifying resolver installed, such as
unbound, is highly recommended. Run as root:

	# Create mox user and homedir (or pick another name or homedir):
	useradd -m -d /home/mox mox

	cd /home/mox
	... compile or download mox to this directory, see below ...

	# Generate config files for your address/domain:
	./mox quickstart you@example.com

The quickstart:

- Creates configuration files mox.conf and domains.conf.
- Adds the domain and an account for the email address to domains.conf
- Generates an admin and account password.
- Prints the DNS records you need to add, for the machine and domain.
- Prints commands to start mox, and optionally install mox as a service.

A machine that doesn&#039;t already run a webserver is highly recommended because
modern email requires HTTPS, and mox currently needs to run a webserver for
automatic TLS with ACME.  You could combine mox with an existing webserver, but
it requires a lot more configuration. If you want to serve websites on the same
machine, consider using the webserver built into mox. It&#039;s pretty good! If you
want to run an existing webserver on port 443/80, see `mox help quickstart`.

After starting, you can access the admin web interface on internal IPs.

# Download

Download a mox binary from
https://beta.gobuilds.org/github.com/mjl-/mox@latest/linux-amd64-latest/.

Symlink or rename it to &quot;mox&quot;.

The URL above always resolves to the latest release for linux/amd64 built with
the latest Go toolchain.  See the links at the bottom of that page for binaries
for other platforms.

# Compiling

You can easily (cross) compile mox yourself. You need a recent Go toolchain
installed.  Run `go version`, it must be &gt;= 1.23. Download the latest version
from https://go.dev/dl/ or see https://go.dev/doc/manage-install.

To download the source code of the latest release, and compile it to binary &quot;mox&quot;:

	GOBIN=$PWD CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/mjl-/mox@latest

Mox only compiles for and fully works on unix systems. Mox also compiles for
Windows, but &quot;mox serve&quot; does not yet work, though &quot;mox localserve&quot; (for a
local test instance) and most other subcommands do. Mox does not compile for
Plan 9.

# Docker

Although not recommended, you can also run mox with docker image
`r.xmox.nl/mox`, with tags like `v0.0.1` and `v0.0.1-go1.20.1-alpine3.17.2`, see
https://r.xmox.nl/r/mox/.  See
https://github.com/mjl-/mox/blob/main/docker-compose.yml to get started.

New docker images aren&#039;t (automatically) generated for new Go runtime/compile
releases.

It is important to run with docker host networking, so mox can use the public
IPs and has correct remote IP information for incoming connections (important
for junk filtering and rate-limiting).

# Development

See develop.txt for instructions/tips for developing on mox.

# Roadmap

- &quot;mox setup&quot; command, using admin web interface for interactive setup
- Automate DNS management, for setup and maintenance, such as DANE/DKIM key rotation
- Config options for &quot;transactional email domains&quot;, for which mox will only
  send messages
- More IMAP extensions (NOTIFY, UIDONLY)
- Encrypted storage of files (email messages, TLS keys), also with per account keys
- Recognize common deliverability issues and help postmasters solve them
- JMAP, IMAP OBJECTID extension, IMAP JMAPACCESS extension
- Calendaring with CalDAV/iCal
- Introbox, to which first-time senders are delivered
- Add special IMAP mailbox (&quot;Queue?&quot;) that contains queued but
  undelivered messages, updated with IMAP flags/keywords/tags and message headers.
- External addresses in aliases/lists.
- Autoresponder (out of office/vacation)
- Mailing list manager
- IMAP extensions for &quot;online&quot;/non-syncing/webmail clients (SORT (including
  DISPLAYFROM, DISPLAYTO), THREAD, PARTIAL, CONTEXT=SEARCH CONTEXT=SORT ESORT,
  FILTERS)
- IMAP ACL support, for account sharing (interacts with many extensions and code)
- Improve support for mobile clients with extensions: IMAP URLAUTH, SMTP
  CHUNKING and BINARYMIME, IMAP CATENATE
- Privilege separation, isolating parts of the application to more restricted
  sandbox (e.g. new unauthenticated connections)
- Using mox as backup MX
- Sieve for filtering (for now see Rulesets in the account config)
- ARC, with forwarded email from trusted source
- Milter support, for integration with external tools
- SMTP DSN extension
- IMAP Sieve extension, to run Sieve scripts after message changes (not only
  new deliveries)
- OAUTH2 support, for single sign on
- Forwarding (to an external address)

There are many smaller improvements to make as well, search for &quot;todo&quot; in the code.

## Not supported/planned

There is currently no plan to implement the following. Though this may
change in the future.

- Functioning as an SMTP relay without authentication
- POP3
- Delivery to (unix) OS system users (mbox/Maildir)
- Support for pluggable delivery mechanisms


# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## Why a new mail server implementation?

Mox aims to make &quot;running a mail server&quot; easy and nearly effortless. Excellent
quality (open source) mail server software exists, but getting a working setup
typically requires you configure half a dozen services (SMTP, IMAP,
SPF/DKIM/DMARC, spam filtering), which are often written in C (where small bugs
often have large consequences). That seems to lead to people no longer running
their own mail servers, instead switching to one of the few centralized email
providers. Email with SMTP is a long-time decentralized messaging protocol. To
keep it decentralized, people need to run their own mail server. Mox aims to
make that easy.

## Where is the documentation?

To keep mox as a project maintainable, documentation is integrated into, and
generated from the code.

A list of mox commands, and their help output, are at
https://www.xmox.nl/commands/.

Mox is configured through configuration files, and each field comes with
documentation. See https://www.xmox.nl/config/ for config files containing all
fields and their documentation.

You can get the same information by running &quot;mox&quot; without arguments to list its
subcommands and usage, and &quot;mox help [subcommand]&quot; for more details.

The example config files are printed by &quot;mox config describe-static&quot; and &quot;mox
config describe-dynamic&quot;.

If you&#039;re missing some documentation, please create an issue describing what is
unclear or confusing, and we&#039;ll try to improve the documentation.

## Is Mox affected by SMTP smuggling?

Mox itself is not affected: it only treats &quot;\r\n.\r\n&quot; as SMTP end-of-message.
But read on for caveats.

SMTP smuggling exploits differences in handling by SMTP servers of: carriage
returns (CR, or &quot;\r&quot;), newlines (line feeds, LF, &quot;\n&quot;) in the context of &quot;dot
stuffing&quot;.  SMTP is a text-based protocol. An SMTP transaction to send a
message is finalized with a &quot;\r\n.\r\n&quot; sequence. This sequence could occur in
the message being transferred, so any verbatim &quot;.&quot; at the start of a line in a
message is &quot;escaped&quot; with another dot (&quot;dot stuffing&quot;), to not trigger the SMTP
end-of-message. SMTP smuggling takes advantage of bugs in some mail servers
that interpret other sequences than &quot;\r\n.\r\n&quot; as SMTP end-of-message. For
example &quot;\n.\n&quot; or even &quot;\r.\r&quot;, and perhaps even other magic character
combinations.

Before v0.0.9, mox accepted SMTP transactions with bare carriage returns
(without newline) for compatibility with real-world email messages, considering
them meaningless and therefore innocuous.

Since v0.0.9, SMTP transactions with bare carriage returns are rejected.
Sending messages with bare carriage returns to buggy mail servers can cause
those mail servers to materialize non-existent messages. Now that mox rejects
messages with bare carriage returns, sending a message through mox can no
longer be used to trigger those bugs.

Mox can still handle bare carriage returns in email messages, e.g. those
imported from mbox files or Maildirs, or from messages added over IMAP. Mox
still fixes up messages with bare newlines by adding the missing carriage
returns.

Before v0.0.9, an SMTP transaction for a message containing &quot;\n.\n&quot; would
result in a non-specific error message, and &quot;\r\n.\n&quot; would result in the dot
being dropped. Since v0.0.9, these sequences are rejected with a message
mentioning SMTP smuggling.

## How do I import/export email?

Use the import functionality on the accounts web page to import a zip/tgz with
maildirs/mbox files, or use the &quot;mox import maildir&quot; or &quot;mox import mbox&quot;
subcommands. You could also use your IMAP email client, add your mox account,
and copy or move messages from one account to the other.

Similarly, see the export functionality on the accounts web page and the &quot;mox
export maildir&quot; and &quot;mox export mbox&quot; subcommands to export email.

Importing large mailboxes may require a lot of memory (a limitation of the
current database). Splitting up mailboxes in smaller parts (e.g. 100k messages)
would help.

## How can I help?

Mox needs users and testing in real-life setups! So just give it a try, send
and receive emails through it with your favourite email clients, and file an
issue if you encounter a problem or would like to see a feature/functionality
implemented.

Instead of switching email for your domain over to mox, you could simply
configure mox for a subdomain, e.g. [you]@moxtest.[yourdomain].

If you have experience with how the email protocols are used in the wild, e.g.
compatibility issues, limitations, anti-spam measures, specification
violations, that would be interesting to hear about.

Pull requests for bug fixes and new code are welcome too. If the changes are
large, it helps to start a discussion (create an &quot;issue&quot;) before doing all the
work. In practice, starting with a small contribution and growing from there has
the highest chance of success.

By contributing (e.g. code), you agree your contributions are licensed under the
MIT license (like mox), and have the rights to do so.

## Where can I discuss mox?

Join #mox on irc.oftc.net, or #mox:matrix.org (https://matrix.to/#/#mox:matrix.org),
or #mox on the &quot;Gopher slack&quot;.

For bug reports, please file an issue at https://github.com/mjl-/mox/issues/new.

## How do I change my password?

Regular users (doing IMAP/SMTP with authentication) can change their password
at the account page, e.g. `http://localhost/`. Or you can set a password with &quot;mox
setaccountpassword&quot;.

The admin can change the password of any account through the admin page, at
`http://localhost/admin/` by default (leave username empty when logging in).

The account and admin pages are served on localhost for configs created with
the quickstart.  To access these from your browser, run
`ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 you@yourmachine` locally and open
`http://localhost:8080/[...]`.

The admin password can be changed with &quot;mox setadminpassword&quot;.

## How do I configure a second mox instance as a backup MX?

Unfortunately, mox does not yet provide an option for that. Mox does spam
filtering based on reputation of received messages. It will take a good amount
of work to share that information with a backup MX. Without that information,
spammers could use a backup MX to get their spam accepted.

Until mox has a proper solution, you can simply run a single SMTP server. The
author has run a single mail server for over a decade without issues. Machines
and network connectivity are stable nowadays, and email delivery will be
retried for many hours during temporary errors (e.g. when rebooting a machine
after updates).

## How do I stay up to date?

Please set &quot;CheckUpdates: true&quot; in mox.conf. Mox will check for a new version
through a DNS TXT request for `_updates.xmox.nl` once per 24h. Only if a new
version is published will the changelog be fetched and delivered to the
postmaster mailbox.

The changelog, including latest update instructions, is at
https://updates.xmox.nl/changelog.

You can also monitor newly added releases on this repository with the github
&quot;watch&quot; feature, or use the github RSS feed for tags
(https://github.com/mjl-/mox/tags.atom) or releases
(https://github.com/mjl-/mox/releases.atom), or monitor the docker images.

Keep in mind you have a responsibility to keep the internet-connected software
you run up to date and secure.

## How do I upgrade my mox installation?

We try to make upgrades effortless and you can typically just put a new binary
in place and restart. If manual actions are required, the release notes mention
them. Check the release notes of all version between your current installation
and the release you&#039;re upgrading to.

Before upgrading, make a backup of the config &amp; data directory with `mox backup
&lt;destdir&gt;`. This copies all files from the config directory to
`&lt;destdir&gt;/config`, and creates `&lt;destdir&gt;/data` with a consistent snapshots of
the database files, and message files from the outgoing queue and accounts.
Using the new mox binary, run `mox verifydata &lt;destdir&gt;/data` (do NOT use the
&quot;live&quot; data directory!) for a dry run. If this fails, an upgrade will probably
fail too.

Important: verifydata with the new mox binary can modify the database files
(due to automatic schema upgrades). So make a fresh backup again before the
actual upgrade. See the help output of the &quot;backup&quot; and &quot;verifydata&quot; commands
for more details.

During backup, message files are hardlinked if possible, and copied otherwise.
Using a destination directory like `data/tmp/backup` increases the odds
hardlinking succeeds: the default mox systemd service file mounts
the data directory separately, so hardlinks to outside the data directory are
cross-device and will fail.

If an upgrade fails and you have to restore (parts) of the data directory, you
should run `mox verifydata &lt;datadir&gt;` (with the original binary) on the
restored directory before starting mox again. If problematic files are found,
for example queue or account message files that are not in the database, run
`mox verifydata -fix &lt;datadir&gt;` to move away those files. After a restore, you may
also want to run `mox bumpuidvalidity &lt;account&gt;` for each account for which
messages in a mailbox changed, to force IMAP clients to synchronize mailbox
state.

## How secure is mox?

Security is high on the priority list for mox. Mox is young, so don&#039;t expect no
bugs at all. Mox does have automated tests for some security aspects, e.g. for
login, and uses fuzzing. Mox is written in Go, so some classes of bugs such as
buffer mishandling do not typically result in privilege escalation.  Of course
logic bugs will still exist. If you find any security issues, please email them
to mechiel@ueber.net.

## I&#039;m now running an email server, but how does email work?

Congrats and welcome to the club! Running an email server on the internet comes
with some responsibilities so you should understand how it works. See
https://explained-from-first-principles.com/email/ for a thorough explanation.

## What are the minimum requirements to run mox?

Mox does not need much. Nowadays most machines are larger than mox needs. You
can start with a machine with 512MB RAM, any CPU will do. For storage you
should account for the size of the email messages (no compression currently),
an additional 15% overhead for the meta data, and add some more headroom.
Expand as necessary.

## Won&#039;t the big email providers block my email?

It is a common misconception that it is impossible to run your own email server
nowadays. The claim is that the handful big email providers will simply block
your email. However, you can run your own email server just fine, and your
email will be accepted, provided you are doing it right.

If your email is rejected, it is often because your IP address has a bad email
sending reputation. Email servers often use IP blocklists to reject email
networks with a bad email sending reputation. These blocklists often work at
the level of whole network ranges. So if you try to run an email server from a
hosting provider with a bad reputation (which happens if they don&#039;t monitor
their network or don&#039;t act on abuse/spam reports), your IP too will have a bad
reputation and other mail servers (both large and small) may reject messages
coming from you. During the quickstart, mox checks if your IPs are on a few
often-used blocklists. It&#039;s typically not a good idea to host an email server
on the cheapest or largest cloud providers: They often don&#039;t spend the
resources necessary for a good reputation, or they simply block all outgoing
SMTP traffic. It&#039;s better to look for a technically-

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.

## Customize a model

### Import from GGUF

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile:

1. Create a file named `Modelfile`, with a `FROM` instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.

   ```
   FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
   ```

2. Create the model in Ollama

   ```shell
   ollama create example -f Modelfile
   ```

3. Run the model

   ```shell
   ollama run example
   ```

### Import from Safetensors

See the [guide](docs/import.md) on importing models for more information.

### Customize a prompt

Models from the Ollama library can be customized with a prompt. For example, to customize the `llama3.2` model:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Create a `Modelfile`:

```
FROM llama3.2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are Mario from Super Mario Bros. Answer as Mario, the assistant, only.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
```

Next, create and run the model:

```
ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile
ollama run mario
&gt;&gt;&gt; hi
Hello! It&#039;s your friend Mario.
```

For more information on working with a Modelfile, see the [Modelfile](docs/modelfile.md) documentation.

## CLI Reference

### Create a model

`ollama create` is used to create a model from a Modelfile.

```shell
ollama create mymodel -f ./Modelfile
```

### Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
```

&gt; This command can also be used to update a local model. Only the diff will be pulled.

### Remove a model

```shell
ollama rm llama3.2
```

### Copy a model

```shell
ollama cp llama3.2 my-model
```

### Multiline input

For multiline input, you can wrap text with `&quot;&quot;&quot;`:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello,
... world!
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
I&#039;m a basic program that prints the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message to the console.
```

### Multimodal models

```
ollama run llava &quot;What&#039;s in this image? /Users/jmorgan/Desktop/smile.png&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: The image features a yellow smiley face, which is likely the central focus of the picture.

### Pass the prompt as an argument

```shell
ollama run llama3.2 &quot;Summarize this file: $(cat README.md)&quot;
```

&gt; **Output**: Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications.

### Show model information

```shell
ollama show llama3.2
```

### List models on your computer

```shell
ollama list
```

### List which models are currently loaded

```shell
ollama ps
```

### Stop a model which is currently running

```shell
ollama stop llama3.2
```

### Start Ollama

`ollama serve` is used when you want to start ollama without running the desktop application.

## Building

See the [developer guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/development.md)

### Running local builds

Next, start the server:

```shell
./ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```shell
./ollama run llama3.2
```

## REST API

Ollama has a REST API for running and managing models.

### Generate a response

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;
}&#039;
```

### Chat with a model

```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#039;{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3.2&quot;,
  &quot;messages&quot;: [
    { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;why is the sky blue?&quot; }
  ]
}&#039;
```

See the [API documentation](./docs/api.md) for all endpoints.

### 📢 New Release for Win &amp; Mac Desktop Version – Welcome to Test and Provide Feedback

## Overview

Krillin AI is an all-in-one solution for effortless video localization and enhancement. This minimalist yet powerful tool handles everything from translation, dubbing to voice cloning，formatting—seamlessly converting videos between landscape and portrait modes for optimal display across all content platforms(YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Douyin, WeChat Channel, RedNote, Kuaishou). With its end-to-end workflow, Krillin AI transforms raw footage into polished, platform-ready content in just a few clicks.

## Key Features:
🎯 **One-Click Start** - Launch your workflow instantly 

📥 **Video download** - yt-dlp and local file uploading supported

📜 **Precise Subtitles** - Whisper-powered high-accuracy recognition

🧠 **Smart Segmentation** - LLM-based subtitle chunking &amp; alignment

🌍 **Professional Translation** - Paragraph-level translation for consistency 

🔄 **Term Replacement** - One-click domain-specific vocabulary swap 

🎙️ **Dubbing and Voice Cloning** - CosyVoice selected or cloning voices

🎬 **Video Composition** - Auto-formatting for horizontal/vertical layouts

## Showcase
The following picture demonstrates the effect after the subtitle file, which was generated through a one-click operation after importing a 46-minute local video, was inserted into the track. There was no manual adjustment involved at all. There are no missing or overlapping subtitles, the sentence segmentation is natural, and the translation quality is also quite high.

## Interface Preview
![ui preview](./docs/images/ui_desktop.png)

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Basic Steps
1. Download the executable file that matches your device system from the release and place it in an empty folder.
2. Create a `config` folder inside the folder, then create a `config.toml` file in the `config` folder. Copy the content from the `config-example.toml` file in the source code&#039;s `config` directory into `config.toml` and fill in your configuration information accordingly.
3. Double-click the executable file to start the service.
4. Open a browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:8888` to start using it (replace 8888 with the port you configured in the `config.toml` file).

### To: macOS Users
This software is not signed, so after completing the file configuration in the &quot;Basic Steps,&quot; you will need to manually trust the application on macOS. Follow these steps:
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is `KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64`) is located.
2. Execute the following commands in sequence:
```
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
```
This will start the service.

### Docker Deployment
This project supports Docker deployment. Please refer to the [Docker Deployment Instructions](./docs/docker.md).

### Cookie Configuration Instructions

If you encounter video download failures, please refer to the [Cookie Configuration Instructions](./docs/get_cookies.md) to configure your cookie information.

### Configuration Help
The quickest and most convenient configuration method:
* Select `openai` for both `transcription_provider` and `llm_provider`. In this way, you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` in the following three major configuration item categories, namely `openai`, `local_model`, and `aliyun`, and then you can conduct subtitle translation. (Fill in `app.proxy`, `model` and `openai.base_url` as per your own situation.)

The configuration method for using the local speech recognition model (macOS is not supported for the time being) (a choice that takes into account cost, speed, and quality):
* Fill in `fasterwhisper` for `transcription_provider` and `openai` for `llm_provider`. In this way, you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` and `local_model.faster_whisper` in the following three major configuration item categories, namely `openai` and `local_model`, and then you can conduct subtitle translation. The local model will be downloaded automatically. (The same applies to `app.proxy` and `openai.base_url` as mentioned above.)

The following usage situations require the configuration of Alibaba Cloud:
* If `llm_provider` is filled with `aliyun`, it indicates that the large model service of Alibaba Cloud will be used. Consequently, the configuration of the `aliyun.bailian` item needs to be set up.
* If `transcription_provider` is filled with `aliyun`, or if the &quot;voice dubbing&quot; function is enabled when starting a task, the voice service of Alibaba Cloud will be utilized. Therefore, the configuration of the `aliyun.speech` item needs to be filled in.
* If the &quot;voice dubbing&quot; function is enabled and local audio files are uploaded for voice timbre cloning at the same time, the OSS cloud storage service of Alibaba Cloud will also be used. Hence, the configuration of the `aliyun.oss` item needs to be filled in.
Configuration Guide: [Alibaba Cloud Configuration Instructions](./docs/aliyun.md)

approach: it provides the ability to wrap both Go code and a web frontend into a single binary. Tools are provided to
make this easy for you by handling project creation, compilation and bundling. All you have to do is get creative!

## Features

- Use standard Go for the backend
- Use any frontend technology you are already familiar with to build your UI
- Quickly create rich frontends for your Go programs using pre-built templates
- Easily call Go methods from Javascript
- Auto-generated Typescript definitions for your Go structs and methods
- Native Dialogs &amp; Menus
- Native Dark / Light mode support
- Supports modern translucency and &quot;frosted window&quot; effects
- Unified eventing system between Go and Javascript
- Powerful cli tool to quickly generate and build your projects
- Multiplatform
- Uses native rendering engines - _no embedded browser_!

## FAQ

- Is this an alternative to Electron?

  Depends on your requirements. It&#039;s designed to make it easy for Go programmers to make lightweight desktop
  applications or add a frontend to their existing applications. Wails does offer native elements such as menus
  and dialogs, so it could be considered a lightweight electron alternative.

- Who is this project aimed at?

  Go programmers who want to bundle an HTML/JS/CSS frontend with their applications, without resorting to creating a
  server and opening a browser to view it.

- What&#039;s with the name?

  When I saw WebView, I thought &quot;What I really want is tooling around building a WebView app, a bit like Rails is to
  Ruby&quot;. So initially it was a play on words (Webview on Rails). It just so happened to also be a homophone of the
  English name for the [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) I am from. So it stuck.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cloudflare Terraform Provider

## Requirements

Terraform 1.2 or newer. We recommend running the [latest version](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads?product_intent=terraform) for optimal compatibility with the Cloudflare provider. Terraform versions older than 1.2 have known issues with newer features and internals.

## Documentation

Full, comprehensive documentation is available on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs). [API documentation](https://api.cloudflare.com) and [Developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com) is also available
for non-Terraform or service specific information.

## Usage

&lt;!-- x-release-please-start-version --&gt;

```hcl
# Declare the provider and version
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudflare = {
      source  = &quot;cloudflare/cloudflare&quot;
      version = &quot;~&gt; 5.0.0&quot;
    }
  }
}

# Initialize the provider
provider &quot;cloudflare&quot; {
  api_token = &quot;Sn3lZJTBX6kkg7OdcBUAxOO963GEIyGQqnFTOFYY&quot; # or set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN env variable
}

# Configure a resource
resource &quot;cloudflare_zone&quot; &quot;example_zone&quot; {
  account = {
    id = &quot;023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353&quot;
  }
  name = &quot;example.com&quot;
  type = &quot;full&quot;
}
```

&lt;!-- x-release-please-end --&gt;

Initialize your project by running `terraform init` in the directory.

## Migrating to Terraform from using the Dashboard

Do you have an existing Cloudflare account (or many!) that you&#039;d like to transition
to be managed via Terraform? Check out [cf-terraforming](https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-terraforming)
which is a tool Cloudflare has built to help dump the existing resources and
import them into Terraform.

## Maintenance

This SDK is actively maintained, however, many issues are tracked outside of GitHub on internal Cloudflare systems. Members of the community are welcome to join and discuss your issues during our twice monthly triage meetings. For urgent issues, please contact [Cloudflare support](https://www.support.cloudflare.com/s/?language=en_US).

## 🟠 What is Cyclops?

Cyclops is an open-source dev tool that simplifies Kubernetes with an easy-to-use UI, making it less intimidating. Instead of creating and configuring your Kubernetes manifests with YAML, use Cyclops to painlessly configure and deploy your applications - validations included!

Thanks to the templates system, Cyclops&#039;s UI is highly customizable when defining configurations. Our templates turn hours and days of configuring applications into a few clicks.

&lt;p align= &quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c1e3fff-7106-4afb-9c29-e0aef7d7dd86&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## 💡 How it works?

Cyclops is a platform that allows DevOps teams to quickly and without coding create custom UIs for developers, QA teams, product managers, and other team members who do not necessarily have experience working with Kubernetes.

**But don’t worry! If you do not have a DevOps team with you, Cyclops comes with a bunch of predefined templates to get you started!**

Under the hood, Cyclops uses Helm charts to create your desired UIs. This means you can try Cyclops with any of your existing Helm charts or any public Helm charts you can find!

Read more about it [here](#-templates)

## ⚙️ Install

&gt; _⚠️ Before installing Cyclops, make sure you have all the [prerequisites](https://cyclops-ui.com/docs/installation/prerequisites) ⚠️_

Cyclops can either be installed manually by applying the latest manifest, by using [cyctl](#cyctl), or with the [Glasskube Kubernetes Package Manager](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube/).

To install Cyclops using `kubectl` into your cluster, run the commands below:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyclops-ui/cyclops/v0.18.0/install/cyclops-install.yaml &amp;&amp; kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyclops-ui/cyclops/v0.18.0/install/demo-templates.yaml
```

It will create a new namespace called `cyclops` and deploy everything you need for your Cyclops instance to run.

Now, all that is left is to expose the Cyclops server outside the cluster:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/cyclops-ui 3000:3000 -n cyclops
```

You can now access Cyclops in your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 💾 Templates

Every Cyclops instance comes with a couple of predefined templates. Feel free to use and abuse them!

Helm charts used for these templates can be found [here](https://github.com/cyclops-ui/templates). You can use this repo as a guide to create your own templates. More information on making your own can be found on our [web](https://cyclops-ui.com/docs/templates/).

## 🚧 `cyctl`

The Cyclops command line interface! You can install it with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cyctl#default):

```bash
brew install cyctl
```

**What are you able to do with `cyctl`?**

Besides the basic commands like getting all modules or templates, you can integrate it with GitHub actions to automate some of the Cyclops processes.

For example, once you create a template and publish it on GitHub, GitHub actions could automatically connect the template to your Cyclops instance using our CLI. This would **allow your developers instant access to each new template or any update the template receives**.

## 💪 Contributing

Cyclops is **open-source** and open to external contributors. There are plenty of ways you can contribute to the Cyclops project - with code, feedback, content and GitHub stars⭐

&lt;br/&gt;

**k6** is a modern load-testing tool, built on [our years of experience](https://k6.io/about) in the performance and testing industries.
It&#039;s built to be powerful, extensible, and full-featured. The key design goal is to provide **the best developer experience**.

Its core features are:

- **Configurable load generation.** Even lower-end machines can simulate lots of traffic.
- **Tests as code.** Reuse scripts, modularize logic, version control, and integrate tests with your CI.
- **A full-featured API.** The scripting API is packed with features that help you simulate real application traffic.
- **An embedded JavaScript engine.** The performance of Go, the scripting familiarity of JavaScript.
- **Multiple Protocol support**. HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, Browser, and more.
- **Large extension ecosystem.** You can extend k6 to support your needs. And many people have already shared their extensions with the community!
- **Flexible metrics storage and visualization**. Summary statistics or granular metrics, exported to the service of your choice.
- **Native integration with Grafana cloud**. [SaaS solution](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/k6/) for test execution, metrics correlation, data analysis, and more.

This is what load testing looks like in the 21st century.

## Example script


```js
import http from &quot;k6/http&quot;;
import { check, sleep } from &quot;k6&quot;;

// Test configuration
export const options = {
  thresholds: {
    // Assert that 99% of requests finish within 3000ms.
    http_req_duration: [&quot;p(99) &lt; 3000&quot;],
  },
  // Ramp the number of virtual users up and down
  stages: [
    { duration: &quot;30s&quot;, target: 15 },
    { duration: &quot;1m&quot;, target: 15 },
    { duration: &quot;20s&quot;, target: 0 },
  ],
};

// Simulated user behavior
export default function () {
  let res = http.get(&quot;https://quickpizza.grafana.com&quot;);
  // Validate response status
  check(res, { &quot;status was 200&quot;: (r) =&gt; r.status == 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```

You can run scripts like this on the CLI, or in your CI, or across a Kubernetes cluster.

## Documentation

The docs cover all aspects of using k6. Some highlights include:

- [Get Started](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/). Install, run a test, inspect results.
- [HTTP requests](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/http-requests/). Have your virtual users use HTTP methods.
  Or, check the other [Protocols](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/protocols/).
- [Thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/thresholds/). Set goals for your test, and codify your SLOs.
- [Options](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/k6-options/). Configure your load, duration, TLS certificates, and much, much more.
- [Scenarios](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/).
  Choose how to model your workload: open models, closed models, constant RPS, fixed iterations, and more.
- [Results output](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/). Study, filter, and export your test results.
- [JavaScript API](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/). Reference and examples of all k6 modules.
- [Extensions](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/extensions/). Extend k6 for new protocols and use cases.

These links barely scratch the surface!
