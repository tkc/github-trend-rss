The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct [receiver integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#receiver) such as email, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or many other [mechanisms](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#alertmanager-webhook-receiver) thanks to the webhook receiver. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

## Install

There are various ways of installing Alertmanager.

### Precompiled binaries

Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the
[*download* section](https://prometheus.io/download/)
on [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io). Using the latest production release binary
is the recommended way of installing Alertmanager.

### Docker images

Docker images are available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/alertmanager) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/alertmanager/).

You can launch an Alertmanager container for trying it out with

    $ docker run --name alertmanager -d -p 127.0.0.1:9093:9093 quay.io/prometheus/alertmanager

Alertmanager will now be reachable at http://localhost:9093/.

### Compiling the binary

You can either `go install` it:

```
$ go install github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/cmd/...@latest
# cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus/alertmanager
$ alertmanager --config.file=&lt;your_file&gt;
```

Or clone the repository and build manually:

```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
$ git clone https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager.git
$ cd alertmanager
$ make build
$ ./alertmanager --config.file=&lt;your_file&gt;
```

You can also build just one of the binaries in this repo by passing a name to the build function:
```
$ make build BINARIES=amtool
```

## Example

This is an example configuration that should cover most relevant aspects of the new YAML configuration format. The full documentation of the configuration can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/).

```yaml
global:
  # The smarthost and SMTP sender used for mail notifications.
  smtp_smarthost: &#039;localhost:25&#039;
  smtp_from: &#039;alertmanager@example.org&#039;

# The root route on which each incoming alert enters.
route:
  # The root route must not have any matchers as it is the entry point for
  # all alerts. It needs to have a receiver configured so alerts that do not
  # match any of the sub-routes are sent to someone.
  receiver: &#039;team-X-mails&#039;

  # The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
  # multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
  # be batched into a single group.
  #
  # To aggregate by all possible labels use &#039;...&#039; as the sole label name.
  # This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all
  # alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have
  # a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs
  # its own grouping. Example: group_by: [...]
  group_by: [&#039;alertname&#039;, &#039;cluster&#039;]

  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at
  # least &#039;group_wait&#039; to send the initial notification.
  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start
  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first
  # notification.
  group_wait: 30s

  # When the first notification was sent, wait &#039;group_interval&#039; to send a batch
  # of new alerts that started firing for that group.
  group_interval: 5m

  # If an alert has successfully been sent, wait &#039;repeat_interval&#039; to
  # resend them.
  repeat_interval: 3h

  # All the above attributes are inherited by all child routes and can
  # overwritten on each.

  # The child route trees.
  routes:
  # This route performs a regular expression match on alert labels to
  # catch alerts that are related to a list of services.
  - matchers:
    - service=~&quot;^(foo1|foo2|baz)$&quot;
    receiver: team-X-mails

    # The service has a sub-route for critical alerts, any alerts
    # that do not match, i.e. severity != critical, fall-back to the
    # parent node and are sent to &#039;team-X-mails&#039;
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - severity=&quot;critical&quot;
      receiver: team-X-pager

  - matchers:
    - service=&quot;files&quot;
    receiver: team-Y-mails

    routes:
    - matchers:
      - severity=&quot;critical&quot;
      receiver: team-Y-pager

  # This route handles all alerts coming from a database service. If there&#039;s
  # no team to handle it, it defaults to the DB team.
  - matchers:
    - service=&quot;database&quot;

    receiver: team-DB-pager
    # Also group alerts by affected database.
    group_by: [alertname, cluster, database]

    routes:
    - matchers:
      - owner=&quot;team-X&quot;
      receiver: team-X-pager

    - matchers:
      - owner=&quot;team-Y&quot;
      receiver: team-Y-pager


# Inhibition rules allow to mute a set of alerts given that another alert is
# firing.
# We use this to mute any warning-level notifications if the same alert is
# already critical.
inhibit_rules:
- source_matchers:
    - severity=&quot;critical&quot;
  target_matchers:
    - severity=&quot;warning&quot;
  # Apply inhibition if the alertname is the same.
  # CAUTION: 
  #   If all label names listed in `equal` are missing 
  #   from both the source and target alerts,
  #   the inhibition rule will apply!
  equal: [&#039;alertname&#039;]

## API

The current Alertmanager API is version 2. This API is fully generated via the
[OpenAPI project](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)
and [Go Swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/) with the exception
of the HTTP handlers themselves. The API specification can be found in
[api/v2/openapi.yaml](api/v2/openapi.yaml). A HTML rendered version can be
accessed [here](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus/alertmanager/main/api/v2/openapi.yaml).
Clients can be easily generated via any OpenAPI generator for all major languages.

APIv2 is accessed via the `/api/v2` prefix. APIv1 was deprecated in `0.16.0` and is removed as of version `0.27.0`.
The v2 `/status` endpoint would be `/api/v2/status`. If `--web.route-prefix` is set then API routes are
prefixed with that as well, so `--web.route-prefix=/alertmanager/` would
relate to `/alertmanager/api/v2/status`.

## amtool

`amtool` is a cli tool for interacting with the Alertmanager API. It is bundled with all releases of Alertmanager.

### Install

Alternatively you can install with:
```
$ go install github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/cmd/amtool@latest
```

### Examples

View all currently firing alerts:
```
$ amtool alert
Alertname        Starts At                Summary
Test_Alert       2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!
Test_Alert       2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!
Check_Foo_Fails  2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!
Check_Foo_Fails  2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!
```

View all currently firing alerts with extended output:
```
$ amtool -o extended alert
Labels                                        Annotations                                                    Starts At                Ends At                  Generator URL

alertname=&quot;Test_Alert&quot; instance=&quot;node1&quot;       link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local
alertname=&quot;Check_Foo_Fails&quot; instance=&quot;node0&quot;  link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local
alertname=&quot;Check_Foo_Fails&quot; instance=&quot;node1&quot;  link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local
```

In addition to viewing alerts, you can use the rich query syntax provided by Alertmanager:
```
$ amtool -o extended alert query alertname=&quot;Test_Alert&quot;
Labels                                   Annotations                                                    Starts At                Ends At                  Generator URL
alertname=&quot;Test_Alert&quot; instance=&quot;node0&quot;  link=&quot;https://example.com&quot; summary=&quot;This is a testing alert!&quot;  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local

```

Silence an alert:
```
$ amtool silence add alertname=Test_Alert
b3ede22e-ca14-4aa0-932c-ca2f3445f926

$ amtool silence add alertname=&quot;Test_Alert&quot; instance=~&quot;.+0&quot;

Try out how a template works. Let&#039;s say you have this in your configuration file:
```
templates:
  - &#039;/foo/bar/*.tmpl&#039;
```

Then you can test out how a template would look like with example by using this command:
```
amtool template render --template.glob=&#039;/foo/bar/*.tmpl&#039; --template.text=&#039;{{ template &quot;slack.default.markdown.v1&quot; . }}&#039;
```

### Configuration

`amtool` allows a configuration file to specify some options for convenience. The default configuration file paths are `$HOME/.config/amtool/config.yml` or `/etc/amtool/config.yml`

An example configuration file might look like the following:

```
# Define the path that `amtool` can find your `alertmanager` instance
alertmanager.url: &quot;http://localhost:9093&quot;

# Override the default author. (unset defaults to your username)
author: me@example.com

# Force amtool to give you an error if you don&#039;t include a comment on a silence
comment_required: true

# Set a default output format. (unset defaults to simple)
output: extended

# Set a default receiver
receiver: team-X-pager
```

### Routes

`amtool` allows you to visualize the routes of your configuration in form of text tree view.
Also you can use it to test the routing by passing it label set of an alert
and it prints out all receivers the alert would match ordered and separated by `,`.
(If you use `--verify.receivers` amtool returns error code 1 on mismatch)

Example of usage:
```
# View routing tree of remote Alertmanager
$ amtool config routes --alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9090

# Test if alert matches expected receiver
$ amtool config routes test --config.file=doc/examples/simple.yml --tree --verify.receivers=team-X-pager service=database owner=team-X
```

## High Availability

Alertmanager&#039;s high availability is in production use at many companies and is enabled by default.

&gt; Important: Both UDP and TCP are needed in alertmanager 0.15 and higher for the cluster to work.
&gt;  - If you are using a firewall, make sure to whitelist the clustering port for both protocols.
&gt;  - If you are running in a container, make sure to expose the clustering port for both protocols.

To create a highly available cluster of the Alertmanager the instances need to
be configured to communicate with each other. This is configured using the
`--cluster.*` flags.

- `--cluster.listen-address` string: cluster listen address (default &quot;0.0.0.0:9094&quot;; empty string disables HA mode)
- `--cluster.advertise-address` string: cluster advertise address
- `--cluster.peer` value: initial peers (repeat flag for each additional peer)
- `--cluster.peer-timeout` value: peer timeout period (default &quot;15s&quot;)
- `--cluster.peers-resolve-timeout` value: peers resolve timeout period (default &quot;15s&quot;)
- `--cluster.gossip-interval` value: cluster message propagation speed
  (default &quot;200ms&quot;)
- `--cluster.pushpull-interval` value: lower values will increase
  convergence speeds at expense of bandwidth (default &quot;1m0s&quot;)
- `--cluster.settle-timeout` value: maximum time to wait for cluster
  connections to settle before evaluating notifications.
- `--cluster.tcp-timeout` value: timeout value for tcp connections, reads and writes (default &quot;10s&quot;)
- `--cluster.probe-timeout` value: time to wait for ack before marking node unhealthy
  (default &quot;500ms&quot;)
- `--cluster.probe-interval` value: interval between random node probes (default &quot;1s&quot;)
- `--cluster.reconnect-interval` value: interval between attempting to reconnect to lost peers (default &quot;10s&quot;)
- `--cluster.reconnect-timeout` value: length of time to attempt to reconnect to a lost peer (default: &quot;6h0m0s&quot;)
- `--cluster.label` value: the label is an optional string to include on each packet and stream. It uniquely identifies the cluster and prevents cross-communication issues when sending gossip messages (default:&quot;&quot;)

The chosen port in the `cluster.listen-address` flag is the port that needs to be
specified in the `cluster.peer` flag of the other peers.

The `cluster.advertise-address` flag is required if the instance doesn&#039;t have
an IP address that is part of [RFC 6890](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6890)
with a default route.

To start a cluster of three peers on your local machine use [`goreman`](https://github.com/mattn/goreman) and the
Procfile within this repository.

	goreman start

To point your Prometheus 1.4, or later, instance to multiple Alertmanagers, configure them
in your `prometheus.yml` configuration file, for example:

```yaml
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets:
      - alertmanager1:9093
      - alertmanager2:9093
      - alertmanager3:9093
```

&gt; Important: Do not load balance traffic between Prometheus and its Alertmanagers, but instead point Prometheus to a list of all Alertmanagers. The Alertmanager implementation expects all alerts to be sent to all Alertmanagers to ensure high availability.

### Turn off high availability

If running Alertmanager in high availability mode is not desired, setting `--cluster.listen-address=` prevents Alertmanager from listening to incoming peer requests.

[Lima](https://lima-vm.io/) launches Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing and port forwarding (similar to WSL2).

The original goal of Lima was to promote [containerd](https://containerd.io) including [nerdctl (contaiNERD ctl)](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)
to Mac users, but Lima can be used for non-container applications as well.

Lima also supports other container engines (Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, etc.) and non-macOS hosts (Linux, NetBSD, etc.).

## Getting started
Set up (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install lima
limactl start
```

To run Linux commands:
```bash
lima uname -a
```

To run containers with containerd:
```bash
lima nerdctl run --rm hello-world
```

To run containers with Docker:
```bash
limactl start template://docker
export DOCKER_HOST=$(limactl list docker --format &#039;unix://{{.Dir}}/sock/docker.sock&#039;)
docker run --rm hello-world
```

To run containers with Kubernetes:
```bash
limactl start template://k8s
export KUBECONFIG=$(limactl list k8s --format &#039;unix://{{.Dir}}/copied-from-guest/kubeconfig.yaml&#039;)
kubectl apply -f ...
```

See &lt;https://lima-vm.io/docs/&gt; for the further information.

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework that applies software development principles to AI agent creation. It is designed to simplify building, deploying, and orchestrating agent workflows, from simple tasks to complex systems. While optimized for Gemini, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and compatible with other frameworks.

This Go version of ADK is ideal for developers building cloud-native agent applications, leveraging Go&#039;s strengths in concurrency and performance.

containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.

containerd is a member of CNCF with [&#039;graduated&#039;](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=containerd) status.

containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being used directly by developers or end-users.

![architecture](docs/historical/design/architecture.png)

## Announcements

### containerd v2.0 is now released!
See [`docs/containerd-2.0.md`](docs/containerd-2.0.md).

### Now Recruiting

We are a large inclusive OSS project that is welcoming help of any kind shape or form:
* Documentation help is needed to make the product easier to consume and extend.
* We need OSS community outreach/organizing help to get the word out; manage
and create messaging and educational content; and help with social media, community forums/groups, and google groups.
* We are actively inviting new [security advisors](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#security-advisors) to join the team.
* New subprojects are being created, core and non-core that could use additional development help.
* Each of the [containerd projects](https://github.com/containerd) has a list of issues currently being worked on or that need help resolving.
  - If the issue has not already been assigned to someone or has not made recent progress, and you are interested, please inquire.
  - If you are interested in starting with a smaller/beginner-level issue, look for issues with an `exp/beginner` tag, for example [containerd/containerd beginner issues.](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aexp%2Fbeginner)

## Getting Started

See our documentation on [containerd.io](https://containerd.io):
* [for ops and admins](docs/ops.md)
* [namespaces](docs/namespaces.md)
* [client options](docs/client-opts.md)

To get started contributing to containerd, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are interested in trying out containerd see our example at [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Nightly builds

There are nightly builds available for download [here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/actions?query=workflow%3ANightly).
Binaries are generated from `main` branch every night for `Linux` and `Windows`.

Please be aware: nightly builds might have critical bugs, it&#039;s not recommended for use in production and no support provided.

## Kubernetes (k8s) CI Dashboard Group

The [k8s CI dashboard group for containerd](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd) contains test results regarding
the health of kubernetes when run against main and a number of containerd release branches.

- [containerd-periodics](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd-periodic)

## Runtime Requirements

Runtime requirements for containerd are very minimal. Most interactions with
the Linux and Windows container feature sets are handled via [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) and/or
OS-specific libraries (e.g. [hcsshim](https://github.com/Microsoft/hcsshim) for Microsoft).
The current required version of `runc` is described in [RUNC.md](docs/RUNC.md).

There are specific features
used by containerd core code and snapshotters that will require a minimum kernel
version on Linux. With the understood caveat of distro kernel versioning, a
reasonable starting point for Linux is a minimum 4.x kernel version.

The overlay filesystem snapshotter, used by default, uses features that were
finalized in the 4.x kernel series. If you choose to use btrfs, there may
be more flexibility in kernel version (minimum recommended is 3.18), but will
require the btrfs kernel module and btrfs tools to be installed on your Linux
distribution.

To use Linux checkpoint and restore features, you will need `criu` installed on
your system. See more details in [Checkpoint and Restore](#checkpoint-and-restore).

Build requirements for developers are listed in [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).


## Supported Registries

Any registry which is compliant with the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)
is supported by containerd.

For configuring registries, see [registry host configuration documentation](docs/hosts.md)

## Features

For a detailed overview of containerd&#039;s core concepts and the features it supports,
please refer to the [FEATURES.MD](./docs/features.md) document.

### Releases and API Stability

Please see [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for details on versioning and stability
of containerd components.

Downloadable 64-bit Intel/AMD binaries of all official releases are available on
our [releases page](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases).

For other architectures and distribution support, you will find that many
Linux distributions package their own containerd and provide it across several
architectures, such as [Canonical&#039;s Ubuntu packaging](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+package/containerd).

#### Enabling command auto-completion

Starting with containerd 1.4, the urfave client feature for auto-creation of bash and zsh
autocompletion data is enabled. To use the autocomplete feature in a bash shell for example, source
the autocomplete/ctr file in your `.bashrc`, or manually like:

```
$ source ./contrib/autocomplete/ctr
```

#### Distribution of `ctr` autocomplete for bash and zsh

For bash, copy the `contrib/autocomplete/ctr` script into
`/etc/bash_completion.d/` and rename it to `ctr`. The `zsh_autocomplete`
file is also available and can be used similarly for zsh users.

Provide documentation to users to `source` this file into their shell if
you don&#039;t place the autocomplete file in a location where it is automatically
loaded for the user&#039;s shell environment.

### CRI

`cri` is a [containerd](https://containerd.io/) plugin implementation of the Kubernetes [container runtime interface (CRI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api/blob/master/pkg/apis/runtime/v1/api.proto). With it, you are able to use containerd as the container runtime for a Kubernetes cluster.

![cri](./docs/cri/cri.png)

#### CRI Status

`cri` is a native plugin of containerd. Since containerd 1.1, the cri plugin is built into the release binaries and enabled by default.

The `cri` plugin has reached GA status, representing that it is:
* Feature complete
* Works with Kubernetes 1.10 and above
* Passes all [CRI validation tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/cri-validation.md).
* Passes all [node e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/e2e-node-tests.md).
* Passes all [e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/e2e-tests.md).

See results on the containerd k8s [test dashboard](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd)

#### Validating Your `cri` Setup
A Kubernetes incubator project, [cri-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools), includes programs for exercising CRI implementations. More importantly, cri-tools includes the program `critest` which is used for running [CRI Validation Testing](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/cri-validation.md).

#### CRI Guides
* [Installing with Ansible and Kubeadm](contrib/ansible/README.md)

## 💻 Quickstart

Run the installer script:

```bash
# Basic installation
curl https://localai.io/install.sh | sh
```

For more installation options, see [Installer Options](https://localai.io/docs/advanced/installer/).

### macOS Download:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/releases/latest/download/LocalAI.dmg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-macOS-blue?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=apple&amp;logoColor=white&quot; alt=&quot;Download LocalAI for macOS&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&gt; Note: the DMGs are not signed by Apple as quarantined. See https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/issues/6268 for a workaround, fix is tracked here: https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/issues/6244

Or run with docker:

&gt; **💡 Docker Run vs Docker Start**
&gt; 
&gt; - `docker run` creates and starts a new container. If a container with the same name already exists, this command will fail.
&gt; - `docker start` starts an existing container that was previously created with `docker run`.
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#039;ve already run LocalAI before and want to start it again, use: `docker start -i local-ai`

            <h2>README</h2><pre>Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.

Here is why you might use Teleport:

* Set up SSO for all of your cloud infrastructure [1].
* Protect access to cloud and on-prem services using mTLS endpoints and short-lived certificates.
* Establish tunnels to access services behind NATs and firewalls.
* Provide an audit log with session recording and replay for various protocols.
* Unify Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and enforce the principle of least privilege with  [access requests](https://goteleport.com/features/access-requests/).

[1] The open source version supports only GitHub SSO.

Teleport works with SSH, Kubernetes, databases, RDP, and web services.

## Introduction

Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.

We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:

* [SSH nodes](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).
* [Kubernetes clusters](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction/)
* [PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/database-access/).
* [Internal Web apps](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/application-access/introduction/).
* [Windows Hosts](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/desktop-access/introduction/).
* [Networked servers](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).

You can set up Teleport as a [Linux daemon](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo) or a [Kubernetes deployment](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/).

Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:

- No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
- Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
- Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.

Teleport uses [Go crypto](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto). It is _fully compatible with OpenSSH_, `sshd` servers, and `ssh` clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.

## Docker

### Deploy Teleport

If you wish to deploy Teleport inside a Docker container see the
[installation guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/#running-teleport-on-docker).

### For Local Testing and Development

To run a full test suite locally, see [the test dependencies list](BUILD_macos.md#local-tests-dependencies)

## Building Teleport

The `teleport` repository contains the Teleport daemon binary (written in Go)
and a web UI written in TypeScript.

If your intention is to build and deploy for use in a production infrastructure
a released tag should be used.  The default branch, `master`, is the current
development branch for an upcoming major version.  Get the latest release tags
listed at https://goteleport.com/download/ and then use that tag in the `git clone`.
For example `git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git -b v16.0.0` gets release v16.0.0.

### Dockerized Build

It is often easiest to build with Docker, which ensures that all required
tooling is available for the build. To execute a dockerized build, ensure
that docker is installed and running, and execute:

```
make -C build.assets build-binaries
```

### Local Build

#### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to build Teleport from source. For
maximum compatibility, install the versions of these dependencies using the
versions listed in [`build.assets/versions.mk`](/build.assets/versions.mk):

1. [`Go`](https://golang.org/dl/)
1. [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. [`libfido2`](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2)
1. [`pkg-config`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)

For an example of Dev Environment setup on a Mac, see [these
instructions](/BUILD_macos.md).

#### Perform a build

&gt;**Important**
&gt;
&gt;* The Go compiler is somewhat sensitive to the amount of memory: you will need
   **at least** 1GB of virtual memory to compile Teleport. A 512MB instance
   without swap will **not** work.
&gt;* This will build the latest version of Teleport, **regardless** of whether it
   is stable. If you want to build the latest stable release, run `git checkout`
   and `git submodule update --recursive` to the corresponding tag (for example,
&gt;* run `git checkout v8.0.0`) **before** performing a build.

Get the source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git
cd teleport
```

To perform a build

```shell
make full
```

`tsh` dynamically links against libfido2 by default, to support development
environments, as long as the library itself can be found:

```shell
$ brew install libfido2 pkg-config  # Replace with your package manager of choice

$ make build/tsh
&gt; libfido2 found, setting FIDO2=dynamic
&gt; (...)
```

Release binaries are linked statically against libfido2. You may switch the
linking mode using the FIDO2 variable:

```shell
make build/tsh FIDO2=dynamic # dynamic linking
make build/tsh FIDO2=static  # static linking, for an easy setup use `make enter`
                             # or `build.assets/macos/build-fido2-macos.sh`.
make build/tsh FIDO2=off     # doesn&#039;t link libfido2 in any way
```

`tsh` builds with Touch ID support require access to an Apple Developer account.
If you are a Teleport maintainer, ask the team for access.

#### Build output and run locally

If the build succeeds, the installer will place the binaries in the `build` directory.

Before starting, create default data directories:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p -m0700 /var/lib/teleport
sudo chown $USER /var/lib/teleport
```

#### Running Teleport in a hot reload mode

To speed up your development process, you can run Teleport using
[`CompileDaemon`](https://github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon). This will build
and run the Teleport binary, and then rebuild and restart it whenever any Go
source files change.

1. Install CompileDaemon:

    ```shell
    go install github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon@latest
    ```

    Note that we use `go install` instead of the suggested `go get`, because we
    don&#039;t want CompileDaemon to become a dependency of the project.

1. Build and run the Teleport binary:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload
    ```

    By default, this runs a `teleport start` command. If you want to customize
    the command, for example by providing a custom config file location, you can
    use the `TELEPORT_ARGS` parameter:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload TELEPORT_ARGS=&#039;start --config=/path/to/config.yaml&#039;
    ```

Note that you still need to run [`make grpc`](api/proto/README.md) if you modify
any Protocol Buffers files to regenerate the generated Go sources; regenerating
these sources should in turn cause the CompileDaemon to rebuild and restart
Teleport.

### Web UI

The Teleport Web UI resides in the [web](web) directory.

#### Rebuilding Web UI for development

To rebuild the Teleport UI package, run the following command:

```bash
make docker-ui
```

Then you can replace Teleport Web UI files with the files from the newly-generated `/dist` folder.

To enable speedy iterations on the Web UI, you can run a [local web-dev server](web#web-ui).

You can also tell Teleport to load the Web UI assets from the source directory.
To enable this behavior, set the environment variable `DEBUG=1` and rebuild with the default target:

```bash
# Run Teleport as a single-node cluster in development mode:
DEBUG=1 ./build/teleport start -d
```

Keep the server running in this mode, and make your UI changes in `/dist` directory.
For instructions about how to update the Web UI, read [the `web` README](web#readme).

### Managing dependencies

All dependencies are managed using [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules). Here are the instructions for some common tasks:

#### Add a new dependency

Latest version:

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency
```

and update the source to use this dependency.


To get a specific version, use `go get github.com/new/dependency@version` instead.

#### Set dependency to a specific version

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency@version
```

#### Update dependency to the latest version

```bash
go get -u github.com/new/dependency
```

#### Update all dependencies

```bash
go get -u all
```

#### Debugging dependencies

Why is a specific package imported?

`go mod why $pkgname`

Why is a specific module imported?

`go mod why -m $modname`

Why is a specific version of a module imported?

`go mod graph | grep $modname`

## Why did We Build Teleport?

The Teleport creators used to work together at Rackspace. We noticed that most cloud computing users struggle with setting up and configuring infrastructure security because popular tools, while flexible, are complex to understand and expensive to maintain. Additionally, most organizations use multiple infrastructure form factors such as several cloud providers, multiple cloud accounts, servers in colocation, and even smart devices. Some of those devices run on untrusted networks, behind third-party firewalls. This only magnifies complexity and increases operational overhead.

We had a choice, either start a security consulting business or build a solution that&#039;s dead-easy to use and understand. A real-time representation of all of your servers in the same room as you, as if they were magically _teleported_. Thus, Teleport was born!

# NexaSDK - Run any AI model on any backend

NexaSDK is an easy-to-use developer toolkit for running any AI model locally — across NPUs, GPUs, and CPUs — powered by our NexaML engine, built entirely from scratch for peak performance on every hardware stack. Unlike wrappers that depend on existing runtimes, NexaML is a unified inference engine built at the kernel level. It’s what lets NexaSDK achieve Day-0 support for new model architectures (LLMs, multimodal, audio, vision). NexaML supports 3 model formats: GGUF, MLX, and Nexa AI&#039;s own `.nexa` format.

## Step 2: Run models with one line of code

You can run any compatible GGUF, MLX, or nexa model from 🤗 Hugging Face by using the `nexa infer &lt;full repo name&gt;`.

### GGUF models

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; GGUF runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows on CPU/GPU. Note certain GGUF models are only supported by NexaSDK (e.g. Qwen3-VL-4B and 8B).

📝 Run and chat with LLMs, e.g. Qwen3:

```bash
nexa infer ggml-org/Qwen3-1.7B-GGUF
```

🖼️ Run and chat with Multimodal models, e.g. Qwen3-VL-4B:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-GGUF
```

### MLX models

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; MLX is macOS-only (Apple Silicon). Many MLX models in the Hugging Face mlx-community organization have quality issues and may not run reliably.
&gt; We recommend starting with models from our curated [NexaAI Collection](https://huggingface.co/NexaAI/collections) for best results. For example

📝 Run and chat with LLMs, e.g. Qwen3:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/Qwen3-4B-4bit-MLX
```

🖼️ Run and chat with Multimodal models, e.g. Gemma3n:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/gemma-3n-E4B-it-4bit-MLX
```

### Qualcomm NPU models

## About

FileBrowser Quantum provides an easy way to access and manage your files from the web. It has a modern responsive interface that has many advanced features to manage users, access, sharing, and file preview and editing.

This version is called &quot;Quantum&quot; because it packs tons of advanced features into a tiny easy to run file. Unlike the majority of alternative options, FileBrowser Quantum is simple to install and easy to configure.

The goal for this repo is to become the best open-source self-hosted file browsing application that exists -- **all for free**. This repo will always be free and open-source.

Ready to try it out? See [Getting Started Docs](https://filebrowserquantum.com/en/docs/getting-started/).

## How its different

FileBrowser Quantum is a massive fork of the file browser open-source project with the following changes:

  1. ✅ Multiple sources support
  2. ✅ Login support for OIDC, password + 2FA, and proxy.
  3. ✅ Beautiful, Responsive, and Customizable user interface.
  4. ✅ Simplified configuration via `config.yaml` config file.
  5. ✅ Ultra-efficient [indexing](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/wiki/Indexing) and real-time updates
     - Real-time search results as you type.
     - Real-time monitoring and updates in the UI.
     - Search supports file and folder sizes, along with various filters.
  6. ✅ Better listing browsing
     - More file type previews, such as **office** and **video** file previews
     - Instantly switches view modes and sort order without reloading data.
     - Folder sizes are displayed.
     - Navigating remembers the last scroll position.
  7. ✅ Highly configurable and customizable sharing options, incuding:
     - share expiration time
     - users who can access share (including anonymous)
     - styling and themes
     - file viewing, editing, and uploading permissions
  8. ✅ Directory-level access control that can be scoped to user or group.
  8. ✅ Developer API support
     - Ability to create long-lived API Tokens.
     - A helpful Swagger page is available at `/swagger` endpoint for API enabled users.

Notable features that this fork *does not* have (removed):

 - :construction: jobs are not supported yet.
 - ❌ shell commands are completely removed and will not be returned.

FileBrowser Quantum differs significantly from the original version. Many of these changes required a significant overhaul. Creating a fork was a necessary process to make the program better. There have been many growing pains, but a stable release is planned and coming soon.

## System Requirements

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Every file and directory in the source gets indexed (by default). This enables powerful features such as instant search, but large source filesystems can increase your system requirements. [See indexing wiki](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/wiki/Indexing) for more info.

 - **Memory**: depends on configured source complexity. See [how much RAM does it require?](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/discussions/787)
 - **GPU**: Not currently used (planned)

## The UI

The UI has a simple three-component navigation system:

  1. (Left) Multi-action button with slide-out panel.
  2. (Middle) The powerful search bar.
  3. (Right) The view change toggle.

All other functions are moved either into the action menu or pop-up menus.
If the action does not depend on context, it will exist in the slide-out
action panel. If the action is available based on context, it will show up as
a pop-up menu.

## Introduction

`runc` is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification.

## Releases

You can find official releases of `runc` on the [release](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases) page.

All releases are signed by one of the keys listed in the [`runc.keyring` file in the root of this repository](runc.keyring).

## Security

The reporting process and disclosure communications are outlined [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/org/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

### Security Audit
A third party security audit was performed by Cure53, you can see the full report [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/docs/Security-Audit.pdf).

## Building

`runc` only supports Linux. See the header of [`go.mod`](./go.mod) for the minimally required Go version.

### Pre-Requisites

#### Utilities and Libraries

In addition to Go, building `runc` requires multiple utilities and libraries to be installed on your system.

On Ubuntu/Debian, you can install the required dependencies with:

```bash
apt update &amp;&amp; apt install -y make gcc linux-libc-dev libseccomp-dev pkg-config git
```

On CentOS/Fedora, you can install the required dependencies with:

```bash
yum install -y make gcc kernel-headers libseccomp-devel pkg-config git
```

On Alpine Linux, you can install the required dependencies with:

```bash
apk --update add bash make gcc libseccomp-dev musl-dev linux-headers git
```

The following dependencies are optional:

* `libseccomp` - only required if you enable seccomp support; to disable, see [Build Tags](#build-tags)

### Build

```bash
# create a &#039;github.com/opencontainers&#039; in your GOPATH/src
cd github.com/opencontainers
git clone https://github.com/opencontainers/runc
cd runc

make
sudo make install
```

You can also use `go get` to install to your `GOPATH`, assuming that you have a `github.com` parent folder already created under `src`:

```bash
go get github.com/opencontainers/runc
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/opencontainers/runc
make
sudo make install
```

`runc` will be installed to `/usr/local/sbin/runc` on your system.

#### Version string customization

You can see the runc version by running `runc --version`. You can append a custom string to the
version using the `EXTRA_VERSION` make variable when building, e.g.:

```bash
make EXTRA_VERSION=&quot;+build-1&quot;
```

Bear in mind to include some separator for readability.

#### Build Tags

`runc` supports optional build tags for compiling support of various features,
with some of them enabled by default (see `BUILDTAGS` in top-level `Makefile`).

To change build tags from the default, set the `BUILDTAGS` variable for make,
e.g. to disable seccomp:

```bash
make BUILDTAGS=&quot;&quot;
```

To add some more build tags to the default set, use the `EXTRA_BUILDTAGS`
make variable, e.g. to disable checkpoint/restore:

```bash
make EXTRA_BUILDTAGS=&quot;runc_nocriu&quot;
```

| Build Tag     | Feature                               | Enabled by Default | Dependencies        |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| `seccomp`     | Syscall filtering using `libseccomp`. | yes                | `libseccomp`        |
| `runc_nocriu` | **Disables** runc checkpoint/restore. | no                 | `criu`              |

The following build tags were used earlier, but are now obsoleted:
 - **runc_nodmz** (since runc v1.2.1 runc dmz binary is dropped)
 - **nokmem** (since runc v1.0.0-rc94 kernel memory settings are ignored)
 - **apparmor** (since runc v1.0.0-rc93 the feature is always enabled)
 - **selinux**  (since runc v1.0.0-rc93 the feature is always enabled)

### Running the test suite

`runc` currently supports running its test suite via Docker.
To run the suite just type `make test`.

```bash
make test
```

There are additional make targets for running the tests outside of a container but this is not recommended as the tests are written with the expectation that they can write and remove anywhere.

You can run a specific test case by setting the `TESTFLAGS` variable.

```bash
# make test TESTFLAGS=&quot;-run=SomeTestFunction&quot;
```

You can run a specific integration test by setting the `TESTPATH` variable.

```bash
# make test TESTPATH=&quot;/checkpoint.bats&quot;
```

You can run a specific rootless integration test by setting the `ROOTLESS_TESTPATH` variable.

```bash
# make test ROOTLESS_TESTPATH=&quot;/checkpoint.bats&quot;
```

You can run a test using your container engine&#039;s flags by setting `CONTAINER_ENGINE_BUILD_FLAGS` and `CONTAINER_ENGINE_RUN_FLAGS` variables.

```bash
# make test CONTAINER_ENGINE_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--build-arg http_proxy=http://yourproxy/&quot; CONTAINER_ENGINE_RUN_FLAGS=&quot;-e http_proxy=http://yourproxy/&quot;
```

### Go Dependencies Management

`runc` uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for dependencies management.
Please refer to [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for how to add or update
new dependencies.

```
# Update vendored dependencies
make vendor
# Verify all dependencies
make verify-dependencies
```

## Using runc

Please note that runc is a low level tool not designed with an end user
in mind. It is mostly employed by other higher level container software.

Therefore, unless there is some specific use case that prevents the use
of tools like Docker or Podman, it is not recommended to use runc directly.

If you still want to use runc, here&#039;s how.

### Creating an OCI Bundle

In order to use runc you must have your container in the format of an OCI bundle.
If you have Docker installed you can use its `export` method to acquire a root filesystem from an existing Docker container.

```bash
# create the top most bundle directory
mkdir /mycontainer
cd /mycontainer

# create the rootfs directory
mkdir rootfs

# export busybox via Docker into the rootfs directory
docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -
```

After a root filesystem is populated you just generate a spec in the format of a `config.json` file inside your bundle.
`runc` provides a `spec` command to generate a base template spec that you are then able to edit.
To find features and documentation for fields in the spec please refer to the [specs](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) repository.

```bash
runc spec
```

### Running Containers

Assuming you have an OCI bundle from the previous step you can execute the container in two different ways.

The first way is to use the convenience command `run` that will handle creating, starting, and deleting the container after it exits.

```bash
# run as root
cd /mycontainer
runc run mycontainerid
```

If you used the unmodified `runc spec` template this should give you a `sh` session inside the container.

The second way to start a container is using the specs lifecycle operations.
This gives you more power over how the container is created and managed while it is running.
This will also launch the container in the background so you will have to edit
the `config.json` to remove the `terminal` setting for the simple examples
below (see more details about [runc terminal handling](docs/terminals.md)).
Your process field in the `config.json` should look like this below with `&quot;terminal&quot;: false` and `&quot;args&quot;: [&quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]`.


```json
        &quot;process&quot;: {
                &quot;terminal&quot;: false,
                &quot;user&quot;: {
                        &quot;uid&quot;: 0,
                        &quot;gid&quot;: 0
                },
                &quot;args&quot;: [
                        &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;5&quot;
                ],
                &quot;env&quot;: [
                        &quot;PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin&quot;,

                },

                        {
                                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;RLIMIT_NOFILE&quot;,
                                &quot;hard&quot;: 1024,
                                &quot;soft&quot;: 1024
                        }
                ],
                &quot;noNewPrivileges&quot;: true
        },
```

Now we can go through the lifecycle operations in your shell.


```bash
# run as root
cd /mycontainer
runc create mycontainerid

# view the container is created and in the &quot;created&quot; state
runc list

# start the process inside the container
runc start mycontainerid

# after 5 seconds view that the container has exited and is now in the stopped state
runc list

# now delete the container
runc delete mycontainerid
```

This allows higher level systems to augment the containers creation logic with setup of various settings after the container is created and/or before it is deleted. For example, the container&#039;s network stack is commonly set up after `create` but before `start`.

#### Rootless containers
`runc` has the ability to run containers without root privileges. This is called `rootless`. You need to pass some parameters to `runc` in order to run rootless containers. See below and compare with the previous version.

**Note:** In order to use this feature, &quot;User Namespaces&quot; must be compiled and enabled in your kernel. There are various ways to do this depending on your distribution:
- Confirm `CONFIG_USER_NS=y` is set in your kernel configuration (normally found in `/proc/config.gz`)
- Arch/Debian: `echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone`
- RHEL/CentOS 7: `echo 28633 &gt; /proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces`

Run the following commands as an ordinary user:
```bash
# Same as the first example
mkdir ~/mycontainer
cd ~/mycontainer
mkdir rootfs
docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -

# The --rootless parameter instructs runc spec to generate a configuration for a rootless container, which will allow you to run the container as a non-root user.
runc spec --rootless

# The --root parameter tells runc where to store the container state. It must be writable by the user.
runc --root /tmp/runc run mycontainerid
```

#### Supervisors

`runc` can be used with process supervisors and init systems to ensure that containers are restarted when they exit.
An example systemd unit file looks something like this.

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Start My Container

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/runc run -d --pid-file /run/mycontainerid.pid mycontainerid
ExecStopPost=/usr/local/sbin/runc delete mycontainerid
WorkingDirectory=/mycontainer
PIDFile=/run/mycontainerid.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

# Introduction

restic is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure. It supports the three major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and a few smaller ones (FreeBSD, OpenBSD).

For detailed usage and installation instructions check out the [documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

You can ask questions in our [Discourse forum](https://forum.restic.net).

## Quick start

Once you&#039;ve [installed](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html) restic, start
off with creating a repository for your backups:

    $ restic init --repo /tmp/backup
    enter password for new backend:
    enter password again:
    created restic backend 085b3c76b9 at /tmp/backup
    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access the repository.
    Losing your password means that your data is irrecoverably lost.

and add some data:

    $ restic --repo /tmp/backup backup ~/work
    enter password for repository:
    scan [/home/user/work]
    scanned 764 directories, 1816 files in 0:00
    [0:29] 100.00%  54.732 MiB/s  1.582 GiB / 1.582 GiB  2580 / 2580 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
    duration: 0:29, 54.47MiB/s
    snapshot 40dc1520 saved

Next you can either use `restic restore` to restore files or use `restic
mount` to mount the repository via fuse and browse the files from previous
snapshots.

For more options check out the [online documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Backends

Saving a backup on the same machine is nice but not a real backup strategy.
Therefore, restic supports the following backends for storing backups natively:

- [Local directory](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#local)
- [sftp server (via SSH)](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#sftp)
- [HTTP REST server](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server) ([protocol](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#rest-backend), [rest-server](https://github.com/restic/rest-server))
- [Amazon S3](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#amazon-s3) (either from Amazon or using the [Minio](https://minio.io) server)
- [OpenStack Swift](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#openstack-swift)
- [BackBlaze B2](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#backblaze-b2)
- [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#microsoft-azure-blob-storage)
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#google-cloud-storage)
- And many other services via the [rclone](https://rclone.org) [Backend](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#other-services-via-rclone)

# Design Principles

Restic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the
following principles in mind:

-  **Easy**: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise
   you might be tempted to skip it. Restic should be easy to configure
   and use, so that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore
   it. Likewise, restoring data should not be complicated.

-  **Fast**: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by
   your network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files
   every day. Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring
   backups should only transfer data that is needed for the files that
   are to be restored, so that this process is also fast.

-  **Verifiable**: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic
   enables you to easily verify that all data can be restored.

-  **Secure**: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and
   integrity of your data. The location the backup data is stored is
   assumed not to be a trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where
   others like system administrators are able to access your backups).
   Restic is built to secure your data against such attackers.

-  **Efficient**: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should
   only take the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate
   data should be de-duplicated before it is actually written to the
   storage back end to save precious backup space.

# Reproducible Builds

The binaries released with each restic version starting at 0.6.1 are
[reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can
reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that
release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the
[builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).

## Performance

Bifrost adds virtually zero overhead to your AI requests. In sustained 5,000 RPS benchmarks, the gateway added only **11 µs** of overhead per request.

| Metric | t3.medium | t3.xlarge | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Added latency (Bifrost overhead) | 59 µs | **11 µs** | **-81%** |
| Success rate @ 5k RPS | 100% | 100% | No failed requests |
| Avg. queue wait time | 47 µs | **1.67 µs** | **-96%** |
| Avg. request latency (incl. provider) | 2.12 s | **1.61 s** | **-24%** |

**Key Performance Highlights:**

- **Perfect Success Rate** - 100% request success rate even at 5k RPS
- **Minimal Overhead** - Less than 15 µs additional latency per request
- **Efficient Queuing** - Sub-microsecond average wait times
- **Fast Key Selection** - ~10 ns to pick weighted API keys

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tinode Instant Messaging Server

&lt;img src=&quot;docs/logo.svg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=128 height=128&gt; Instant messaging full stack. Backend in pure [Go](http://golang.org) (license [GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)), clients for Android (Java), iOS (Swift), and web (ReactJS), as well as [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) client support for C++, C#, Go, Java, Node, PHP, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, etc (all clients licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). Wire transport is JSON over websocket (long polling is also available) or [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) with gRPC.

This is beta-quality software: feature-complete and stable but probably with a few bugs or missing features. Follow [instructions](INSTALL.md) to install and run or use one of the cloud services below. Read [API documentation](docs/API.md).

Tinode is *not* XMPP/Jabber. It is *not* compatible with XMPP. It&#039;s meant as a replacement for XMPP. On the surface, it&#039;s a lot like open source WhatsApp or Telegram.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tinode/id1483763538&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/app-store.svg&quot; height=36&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinode.tindroidx&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/play-store.svg&quot; height=36&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.tinode.co/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/web-app.svg&quot; height=36&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Why?

The promise of [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) was to deliver federated instant messaging: anyone would be able to spin up an IM server capable of exchanging messages with any other XMPP server in the world. Unfortunately, XMPP never delivered on this promise. Instant messengers are still a bunch of incompatible walled gardens, similar to what AoL of the late 1990s was to the open Internet.

The goal of this project is to deliver on XMPP&#039;s original vision: create a modern open platform for federated instant messaging with an emphasis on mobile communication. A secondary goal is to create a decentralized IM platform that is much harder to track and block by the governments.

An explicit NON-goal: we are not building yet another Slack replacement.

## Public service

A [public Tinode service](https://web.tinode.co/) is available. You can use it just like any other instant messenger. Keep in mind that demo accounts present in [sandbox](https://sandbox.tinode.co/) are not available in the public service. You must register an account using valid email in order to use the service.

### Web

TinodeWeb, a single page web app, is available at https://web.tinode.co/ ([source](https://github.com/tinode/webapp/)). See screenshots below.

### Android

[Tinode for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinode.tindroidx) a.k.a Tindroid is stable and functional ([source](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid)). See the screenshots below. A [debug APK](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid/releases/latest) is also provided for convenience.

### iOS

[Tinode for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tinode/id1483763538) a.k.a. Tinodios is stable and functional ([source](https://github.com/tinode/ios)). See the screenshots below.


## Demo/Sandbox

A sandboxed demo service is available at https://sandbox.tinode.co/.

Log in as one of `alice`, `bob`, `carol`, `dave`, `frank`. Password is `&lt;login&gt;123`, e.g. login for `alice` is `alice123`. You can discover other users by email or phone by prefixing them with `email:` or `tel:` respectively. Emails are `&lt;login&gt;@example.com`, e.g. `alice@example.com`, phones are `+17025550001` through `+17025550009`.

When you register a new account you are asked for an email address to send validation code to. For demo purposes you may use `123456` as a universal validation code. The code you get in the email is also valid.

### Sandbox Notes

* The sandbox server is reset (all data wiped) every night at 3:15am Pacific time. An error message `User not found or offline` means the server was reset while you were connected. If you see it on the web, reload and relogin. On Android log out and re-login. If the database was changed, delete the app then reinstall.
* Sandbox user `Tino` is a [basic chatbot](./chatbot) which responds with a [random quote](http://fortunes.cat-v.org/) to any message.
* As generally accepted, when you register a new account you are asked for an email address. The server will send an email with a verification code to that address and you can use it to validate the account. To make things easier for testing, the server will also accept `123456` as a verification code. Remove line `&quot;debug_response&quot;: &quot;123456&quot;` from `tinode.conf` to disable this option.
* The sandbox server is configured to use [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS [implementation](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/acme) with hard-coded requirement for [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). If you are unable to connect then the most likely reason is your TLS client&#039;s missing support for SNI. Use a different client.
* The default web app loads a single minified javascript bundle and minified CSS. The un-minified version is also available at https://sandbox.tinode.co/index-dev.html
* [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/tinode/) with the same demo are available.
* You are welcome to test your client software against the sandbox, hack it, etc. No DDoS-ing though please.

## Quick Start
&gt; Refer to [Quick Start](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop/wiki/2.-Quickstart) to learn in detail how to install and deploy the latest version of Coze Loop.

### Deployment method 1: Docker deployment (Docker Compose)
&gt; Please install and start Docker Engine before you start.

Procedure:

1. Clone the source code.
   Run the following command to obtain the latest version of the Coze Loop source code.
   ```Bash
   # Clone the code
   git clone https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop.git
   
   # Enter the coze-loop directory
   cd coze-loop 
   ```

2. Configure a model.
   1. Enter the `coze-loop` directory.
   2. Edit the file `release/deployment/docker-compose/conf/model_config.yaml`.
   3. Modify the api_key and model fields. Take Volcengine Ark as an example:
      * api_key: Volcengine Ark API Key. Users in China can refer to the [Volcengine Ark documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1541594), while users outside China can refer to the [BytePlus ModelArk documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1361424?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=coze_open_source).
      * model: The Endpoint ID of the Volcengine Ark model access point. Users within China can refer to [the Volcengine Ark documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1099522); users outside China can refer to [the BytePlus ModelArk documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1099522?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=coze_open_source).
3. Start the service.
   Run the following commands to quickly deploy the open-source version of Coze Loop using Docker Compose.
   ```Bash
   # Start the service (default: development mode)
   # Run in the coze-loop/ directory
   make compose-up 
   ```

4. Access the Coze Loop open-source version through your browser `http://localhost:8082`.

### Deployment method 2: Kubernetes deployment using Helm Chart

&gt; * The Kubernetes cluster has been prepared, the Nginx Ingress add-ons have been enabled, and the Kubectl and Helm tools have been installed.
&gt; * To quickly try it out locally, you can deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. For detailed steps, refer to [Quick Start](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop/wiki/2.-Quickstart).

Procedure:

1. Run the following command to obtain the Helm Chart package.
   ```Bash
   helm pull oci://docker.io/cozedev/coze-loop --version 1.0.0-helm
   tar -zxvf coze-loop-1.0.0-helm.tgz &amp;&amp; cd coze-loop &amp;&amp; rm -f ../coze-loop-1.0.0-helm.tgz
   ```

2. Configure a model.
   Go to the `coze-loop` directory and edit the `release/deployment/helm-chart/umbrella/conf/model_config.yaml` file. Configure the following fields, using Volcengine Ark as an example:
   * api_key: Volcengine Ark API Key. Users in mainland China can refer to the [Volcengine Ark documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1541594), while users outside mainland China can refer to the [BytePlus ModelArk documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1361424?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=coze_open_source).
   * model: The Endpoint ID of the Volcengine Ark model access point. Users in China can refer to the [Volcengine Ark documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1099522), while users outside China can refer to the [BytePlus ModelArk documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1099522?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=coze_open_source).
3. Configure Ingress rules.
   Ingress is used to expose services to external networks. You need to configure the `templates/ingress.yaml` file in the project directory according to the actual cluster situation, manually modify parameters such as ingressClassName, and configure elements such as class, instance, host, and IP allocation.
4. Deploy and start the service.
   Execute the following commands to quickly deploy the open-source version of Coze Loop using Helm.
   ```Bash
   # Run in the coze-loop/ directory
   make helm-up
   # After the service deployment is complete, check the status of the cluster pods
   make helm-pod
   # Check the service startup logs. If both the app and nginx are running normally, the deployment is successful
   make helm-logf-app
   make helm-logf-nginx
   ```

5. Access the Coze Loop open source edition via a browser.
   The access domain name and URL depend on the domain name and URL assigned to your cluster.
6. Start customizing your Coze Loop project.
   Refer to the examples in the `examples/` directory. Modify `values.yaml` to override the default settings. After making changes, rerun `make helm-up` for the changes to take effect.

## 🏃 **Running GoFr**

Here&#039;s a simple example to get a GoFr application up and running:

```go
package main

import &quot;gofr.dev/pkg/gofr&quot;

func main() {
	app := gofr.New()

	app.GET(&quot;/greet&quot;, func(ctx *gofr.Context) (any, error) {
		return &quot;Hello World!&quot;, nil
	})

	app.Run() // listens and serves on localhost:8000
}
```

To run this code:

```bash
$ go run main.go
```

Visit [`localhost:8000/greet`](http://localhost:8000/greet) to see the result.

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Missing --help, --init. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 5.8. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | in progress | Mostly complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit not complete. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled. |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps. |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Some functionality (errors, hover, go to def, refs, sig help). More features coming soon. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.

# pgx - PostgreSQL Driver and Toolkit

pgx is a pure Go driver and toolkit for PostgreSQL.

The pgx driver is a low-level, high performance interface that exposes PostgreSQL-specific features such as `LISTEN` /
`NOTIFY` and `COPY`. It also includes an adapter for the standard `database/sql` interface.

The toolkit component is a related set of packages that implement PostgreSQL functionality such as parsing the wire protocol
and type mapping between PostgreSQL and Go. These underlying packages can be used to implement alternative drivers,
proxies, load balancers, logical replication clients, etc.

## Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;context&quot;
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;

	&quot;github.com/jackc/pgx/v5&quot;
)

func main() {
	// urlExample := &quot;postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name&quot;
	conn, err := pgx.Connect(context.Background(), os.Getenv(&quot;DATABASE_URL&quot;))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Unable to connect to database: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer conn.Close(context.Background())

	var name string
	var weight int64
	err = conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), &quot;select name, weight from widgets where id=$1&quot;, 42).Scan(&amp;name, &amp;weight)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;QueryRow failed: %v\n&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	fmt.Println(name, weight)
}
```

See the [getting started guide](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/wiki/Getting-started-with-pgx) for more information.

## Features

* Support for approximately 70 different PostgreSQL types
* Automatic statement preparation and caching
* Batch queries
* Single-round trip query mode
* Full TLS connection control
* Binary format support for custom types (allows for much quicker encoding/decoding)
* `COPY` protocol support for faster bulk data loads
* Tracing and logging support
* Connection pool with after-connect hook for arbitrary connection setup
* `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY`
* Conversion of PostgreSQL arrays to Go slice mappings for integers, floats, and strings
* `hstore` support
* `json` and `jsonb` support
* Maps `inet` and `cidr` PostgreSQL types to `netip.Addr` and `netip.Prefix`
* Large object support
* NULL mapping to pointer to pointer
* Supports `database/sql.Scanner` and `database/sql/driver.Valuer` interfaces for custom types
* Notice response handling
* Simulated nested transactions with savepoints

## Choosing Between the pgx and database/sql Interfaces

The pgx interface is faster. Many PostgreSQL specific features such as `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` and `COPY` are not available
through the `database/sql` interface.

The pgx interface is recommended when:

1. The application only targets PostgreSQL.
2. No other libraries that require `database/sql` are in use.

It is also possible to use the `database/sql` interface and convert a connection to the lower-level pgx interface as needed.

## Testing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup instructions.

## Architecture

See the presentation at Golang Estonia, [PGX Top to Bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXMSWhcHCf8) for a description of pgx architecture.

## Supported Go and PostgreSQL Versions

pgx supports the same versions of Go and PostgreSQL that are supported by their respective teams. For [Go](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy) that is the two most recent major releases and for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) the major releases in the last 5 years. This means pgx supports Go 1.24 and higher and PostgreSQL 13 and higher. pgx also is tested against the latest version of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/).

## Version Policy

pgx follows semantic versioning for the documented public API on stable releases. `v5` is the latest stable major version.

## PGX Family Libraries

### [github.com/jackc/pglogrepl](https://github.com/jackc/pglogrepl)

pglogrepl provides functionality to act as a client for PostgreSQL logical replication.

### [github.com/jackc/pgmock](https://github.com/jackc/pgmock)

pgmock offers the ability to create a server that mocks the PostgreSQL wire protocol. This is used internally to test pgx by purposely inducing unusual errors. pgproto3 and pgmock together provide most of the foundational tooling required to implement a PostgreSQL proxy or MitM (such as for a custom connection pooler).

### [github.com/jackc/tern](https://github.com/jackc/tern)

tern is a stand-alone SQL migration system.

### [github.com/jackc/pgerrcode](https://github.com/jackc/pgerrcode)

pgerrcode contains constants for the PostgreSQL error codes.

![Crossplane](banner.png)

Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
needing to write code. It has a highly extensible backend that enables you to
build a control plane that can orchestrate applications and infrastructure no
matter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend that puts you in
control of the schema of the declarative API it offers.

Crossplane is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][cncf] project.

## Get Started

Crossplane&#039;s [Get Started Docs] covers install and resource quickstarts.

## Roadmap

The public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues
added to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the
community, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.

The maintainer team regularly triages requests from the community to identify
features and issues of suitable scope and impact to include in this roadmap. The
community is encouraged to show their support for potential roadmap issues by
adding a :+1: reaction, leaving descriptive comments, and attending the
[regular community meetings] to discuss their requirements and use cases.

The maintainer team updates the roadmap on an as needed basis, in response to
demand, priority, and available resources. The public roadmap can be updated at
any time.

Milestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of
overall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered
approximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific
delivery timeline.

## Introduction

The NVIDIA Container Toolkit allows users to build and run GPU-accelerated containers. The toolkit includes a container runtime [library](https://github.com/NVIDIA/libnvidia-container) and utilities to automatically configure containers to leverage NVIDIA GPUs.

Product documentation including an architecture overview, platform support, and installation and usage guides can be found in the [documentation repository](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/overview.html).

## Getting Started

**Make sure you have installed the [NVIDIA driver](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#nvidia-drivers) for your Linux Distribution**
**Note that you do not need to install the CUDA Toolkit on the host system, but the NVIDIA driver needs to be installed**

For instructions on getting started with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#installation-guide).

## Usage

The [user guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/user-guide.html) provides information on the configuration and command line options available when running GPU containers with Docker.
