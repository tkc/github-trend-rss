Organize your photos &amp; videos, chats &amp; messages, location history, social media content, contacts, and more into a single cohesive timeline on your own computer where you can keep them alive forever.

Timelinize lets you import your data from practically anywhere: your computer, phone, online accounts, GPS-enabled radios, various apps and programs, contact lists, cameras, and more.

**[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/C9dCnTW6qV)** to discuss!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; I am looking for a better name for this project. If you have an idea for a good name that is short, relevant, unique, and available, [I&#039;d love to hear it!](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues/2)

## Screenshots

These were captured using a dev repository of mine filled with a subset of my real data, so I&#039;ve run Timelinize in obfuscation mode: images and videos are blurred (except profile pictures---need to fix that); names, identifiers, and locations around sensitive areas are all randomized, and text has been replaced with random words so that the string is about the same length.

(I hope to make a video tour soon.)

**Please remember this is an early alpha preview, and the software is very much evolving and improving. And you can help!**

![WIP Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293cbe57-ac75-4c4b-b78a-b75f6d442d99) WIP dashboard. **Very** WIP. The bubble chart is particularly interesting as it shows you what kinds of data are most common at which times of day throughout the years. | ![Timeline view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f808c4-7b0e-4ad0-b12a-6398f6321272) The classic timeline view is a combination of all data grouped by types and time segments for reconstructing a day or other custom time period.
![Item view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f5671c-df85-4af5-9f67-6358e7489442) Viewing an item shows all the information about it, regardless of type: text, photo, live photo, video, location, etc. | ![File picker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf2482e-58a5-434f-a0d2-f9b1274af106) I had to make a custom file picker since browser APIs are too limiting. This is how you&#039;ll import most of your data into your timeline, but this flow is being revised soon.
![3D map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051031c1-0659-4388-b01f-475bb4d24490) The large map view is capable of 3D exploration, showing your memories right where they happened with a color-coded path that represents time. | ![Map showing non-geolocated data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ddbe3cd-4bdc-4d3a-be92-d9c41e29ee1b) Because Timelinize is entity-aware and supports multiple data sources, it can show data on a map even if it doesn&#039;t have geolocation information. That&#039;s what the gray dots or pins represent. In this example, a text message was received while at church, even though it doesn&#039;t have any geolocation info associated with it directly.
![Entities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832c6bce-029c-4abf-943e-84253458a9f7) Timelinize treats entities (people, pets/animals, organizations, etc.) as first-class data points which you can filter and organize. | ![Merge entities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932259b1-fc1d-40bc-b27d-a58e37537c4c) Timelinize will automatically recognize the same entity across data sources with enough information, but if it isn&#039;t possible automatically, you can manually merge entities with a click.
![Conversations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0973df3c-eba9-49b8-b369-0e44f4120c37) Conversations are aggregated across data sources that have messaging capabilities. They become emergent from the database by querying relationships between items and entities. | ![Conversation view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ece383-6702-47ed-8f11-6c95af0cc3de) In this conversation view, you can see messages exchanged with this person across both Facebook and SMS/text message are displayed together. Reactions are also supported.
![Gallery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe89db8e-66b1-4854-9d47-a774bf20961f) A gallery displays photos and videos, but not just those in your photo library: it includes pictures and memes sent via messages, photos and videos uploaded to social media, and any other photos/videos in your data. You can always filter to drill down.


## How it works

1. [Obtain your data.](https://timelinize.com/docs/data-preparation) This usually involves exporting your data from apps, online accounts, or devices. For example, requesting an archive from Google Takeout. (Apple iCloud, Facebook, Twitter/X, Strava, Instagram, etc. all offer similar functionality for GDPR compliance.) Do this early/soon, because some services take days to provide your data.
2. Import your data using Timelinize. You don&#039;t need to extract or decompress .tar or .zip archives; Timelinize will attempt to recognize your data in its original format and folder structure. All the data you import is indexed in a SQLite database and stored on disk organized by date -- no obfuscation or proprietary formats; you can simply browse your files if you wish.
3. Explore and organize! Timelinize has a UI that portrays data using various projections and filters. It can recall moments from your past and help you view your life more comprehensively. (It&#039;s a great living family history tool.)
4. Repeat steps 1-3 as often as desired. Timelinize will skip any existing data that is the same and only import new content. You could do this every few weeks or months for busy accounts that are most important to you.

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Timelinize is in active development and is still considered unstable. The schema is still changing, necessitating starting over from a clean slate when updating. Always keep your original source data. Expect to delete and recreate your timelines as you upgrade during this alpha development period.

## Download and run

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/releases/latest) for your platform.

See the website for [installation instructions](https://timelinize.com/docs/install).

## Develop

See our [project wiki](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/) for instructions on [compiling from source](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/Develop).


## Command line interface

Timelinize has a symmetric HTTP API and CLI. When an HTTP API endpoint is created in the code, it automatically adds to the command line as well.

Run `timelinize help` (or `go run main.go help` if you&#039;re running from source) to view the list of commands, which are also HTTP endpoints. JSON or form inputs are converted to command line args/flags that represent the JSON schema or form fields.

&lt;!-- &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Wails UI info (no longer used)&lt;/summary&gt;

## Wails v2 (native GUI) info

The last commit that used Wails (v2) was b9b80838b2b92501139f2f0c5fab63921a7e6502.
That can be used as a reference if we ever switch back to Wails. The last working
commit that had Wails that was released as a dev preview was
bcb0f732e01e5b0e34a142a35b658a1f328c4c6d.

In July-August 2023 we transitioned away from Wails and went to a client/server
model for stability and flexibility. Wails itself was great, the main problem
was the poor performance of Webkit2GTK, even on Mac it was pretty bad (frequent
crashes).

The instructions below are preserved here for reference in case that comes
in handy, though the commits above also have this in their READMEs:

### Development

Run commands in the project root:

#### Linux, macOS

```bash
$ wails dev
```

#### Windows

```powershell
$env:CC=&quot;zig cc&quot;; $env:CXX=&quot;zig c++&quot;; wails dev
```

Or, if cross-compiling:

```powershell
&gt; $env:CC=&quot;zig cc -target x86_64-windows&quot;; $env:CXX=&quot;zig c++ -target x86_64-windows&quot;; wails dev
```

&lt;/details&gt; --&gt;

## Setup Development Environment
Dev Container setup is provided for easy development using GitHub Codespaces or Visual Studio Code with the DevContainers extension.

### Getting started with VSCode
1. Make sure you have the following installed:

	- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
	- [DevContainers for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. Open this project in VSCode
3. Go to the __Remote Explorer__ on Activity Bar
4. Click on __New Dev Container (+)__
5. Click on __Open Current Folder in Container__

This sets up a docker container with all the dependencies required for building this project. You can get started with contributing quickly.


## Motivation and vision

(For roadmap, see [issues tagged `long-term 🔭`](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22long-term%20%F0%9F%94%AD%22).)

The motivation for this project is two-fold. Both press upon me with a sense of urgency, which is why I dedicated some nights and weekends to work on this.

1. Connecting with my family -- both living and deceased -- is important to me and my close relatives. But I wish we had more insights into the lives of those who came before us. What was important to them? Where did they live / travel / spend their time? What lessons did they learn? How did global and local events -- or heck, even the weather -- affect them? What hardships did they endure? What would they have wanted to remember? What would it be like to talk to them? A lot of this could not be known unless they wrote it all down. But these days, we have that data for ourselves. What better time than right now to start collecting personal histories from all available sources and develop a rich timeline of our life for our family, or even just for our own reference and nostalgia.

2. Our lives are better-documented than any before us, but the record of our life is more ephemeral than any before us, too. We lose control of our data by relying on centralized, proprietary apps and cloud services which are useful today, and gone tomorrow. I wrote Timelinize because now is the time to liberate my data from corporations who don&#039;t own it, yet who have the only copy of it. This reality has made me feel uneasy for years, and it&#039;s not going away soon. Timelinize makes it bearable.

Imagine being able to pull up a single screen with your data from any and all of your online accounts and services -- while offline. And there you see so many aspects of your life at a glance: your photos and videos, social media posts, locations on a map and how you got there, emails and letters, documents, health and physical activities, mental and emotional wellness, and maybe even music you listened to, for any given day. You can &quot;zoom out&quot; and get the big picture. Machine learning algorithms could suggest major clusters based on your content to summarize your days, months, or years, and from that, even recommend printing physical memorabilia. It&#039;s like a highly-detailed, automated journal, fully in your control, which you can add to in the app: augment it with your own thoughts like a regular journal.

Then cross-reference your own timeline with a global public timeline: see how locations you went to changed over time, or what major news events may have affected you, or what the political/social climate -- or the literal climate -- was like at the time. For example, you may wonder, &quot;Why did the family stay inside so much of the summer one year?&quot; You could then see, &quot;Oh, because it was 110 F (43 C) degrees for two months straight.&quot;

Or translate the projection sideways, and instead of looking at time cross-sections, look at cross-sections of your timeline by media type: photos, posts, location, sentiment. Look at plots, charts, graphs, of your physical activity.

Or view projections by space instead of time: view interrelations between items on a map, even items that don&#039;t have location data, because the database is entity-aware. So if a person receives a text message and the same person has location information at about the same time from a photo or GPS device, then the text message can appear on a map too, reminding you where you first got the text with the news about your nephew&#039;s birth.

And all of this runs on your own computer: no one else has access to it, no one else owns it, but you.

And if everyone had their own timeline, in theory they could be merged into a global supertimeline to become a thorough record of the human race, all without the need for centralizing our data on cloud services that are controlled by greedy corporations.

## History

I&#039;ve been working on this project since about 2013, even before I conceptualized [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com). My initial vision was to create an automated backup of my Picasa albums that I could store on my own hard drive. This project was called Photobak. Picasa eventually became Google Photos, and about the same time I realized I wanted to backup my photos posted to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, too. And while I was at it, why not include my Google Location History to augment the location data from the photos. The vision continued to expand as I realized that my family could use this too, so the schema was upgraded to support multiple people/entities as well. This could allow us to merge databases, or timelines, as family members pass, or as they share parts of their timeline around with each other. Timelinize is the mature evolution of the original project that is now designed to be a comprehensive, highly detailed archive of one&#039;s life through digital (or _digitized_) content. An authoritative, unified record that is easy to preserve and organize.

## License

This project is licensed with AGPL. I chose this license because I do not want others to make proprietary or commercial software using this package. The point of this project is liberation of and control over one&#039;s own, personal data, and I want to ensure that this project won&#039;t be used in anything that would perpetuate the walled garden dilemma we already face today. Even if the future of this project ever has proprietary source code, I can ensure it will stay aligned with my values and the project&#039;s original goals.

The [Go][] implementation of [gRPC][]: A high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. For more information see the
[Go gRPC docs][], or jump directly into the [quick start][].

## Prerequisites

- **[Go][]**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases][go-releases].

## Installation

Simply add the following import to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]`
will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:


```go
import &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** If you are trying to access `grpc-go` from **China**, see the
&gt; [FAQ](#FAQ) below.

## FAQ

### I/O Timeout Errors

The `golang.org` domain may be blocked from some countries. `go get` usually
produces an error like the following when this happens:

```console
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot; (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

To build Go code, there are several options:

- Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.

- With Go module support: it is possible to use the `replace` feature of `go
  mod` to create aliases for golang.org packages.  In your project&#039;s directory:

  ```sh
  go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
  go mod tidy
  go mod vendor
  go build -mod=vendor
  ```

  Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on
  golang.org as well. For details, refer to [golang/go issue
  #28652](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652).

### Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion

Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using
`go get google.golang.org/grpc`.

### How to turn on logging

The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on
like this:

```console
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
```

### The RPC failed with error `&quot;code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing&quot;`

This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many
possible reasons, including:
 1. mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking
 1. bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between
 1. server shutdown
 1. Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have
    configured your server to terminate connections regularly to [trigger DNS
    lookups](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779).
    If this is the case, you may want to increase your
    [MaxConnectionAgeGrace](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters),
    to allow longer RPC calls to finish.

It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but
the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on
logging on __both client and server__, and see if there are any transport
errors.

# What is Rook?

Rook is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator** for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for Ceph storage to natively integrate with Kubernetes.

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is a distributed storage system that provides file, block and object storage and is deployed in large scale production clusters.

Rook automates deployment and management of Ceph to provide self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services.
The Rook operator does this by building on Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph.

The status of the Ceph storage provider is **Stable**. Features and improvements will be planned for many future versions. Upgrades between versions are provided to ensure backward compatibility between releases.

Rook is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a [graduated](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/) level project. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who&#039;s involved and how Rook plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/01/29/cncf-host-rook-project-cloud-native-storage-capabilities).

## Installation

### Recommended

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/grype | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```
Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of grype is community-maintained and not distributed by the anchore team.

```bash
choco install grype -y
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap anchore/grype
brew install grype
```

### MacPorts

On macOS, Grype can additionally be installed from the [community-maintained port](https://ports.macports.org/port/grype/) via MacPorts:

```bash
sudo port install grype
```

**Note**: Currently, Grype is built only for macOS and Linux.

### From source

See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md#native-development) for instructions to build and run from source.

### GitHub Actions

If you&#039;re using GitHub Actions, you can use our [Grype-based action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/anchore-container-scan) to run vulnerability scans on your code or container images during your CI workflows.

## Verifying the artifacts

Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.

You need the following tool to verify signature:

- [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)

Verification steps are as follow:

1. Download the files you want, and the checksums.txt, checksums.txt.pem and checksums.txt.sig files from the [releases](https://github.com/anchore/grype/releases) page:

2. Verify the signature:

```shell
cosign verify-blob &lt;path to checksum.txt&gt; \
--certificate &lt;path to checksums.txt.pem&gt; \
--signature &lt;path to checksums.txt.sig&gt; \
--certificate-identity-regexp &#039;https://github\.com/anchore/grype/\.github/workflows/.+&#039; \
--certificate-oidc-issuer &quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot;
```

3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:

```shell
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt
```

## Getting started

[Install the binary](#installation), and make sure that `grype` is available in your path. To scan for vulnerabilities in an image:

```
grype &lt;image&gt;
```

The above command scans for vulnerabilities visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the vulnerability scan, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```
grype &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

To run grype from a Docker container so it can scan a running container, use the following command:

```yml
docker run --rm \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
--name Grype anchore/grype:latest \
$(ImageName):$(ImageTag)
```

## Supported sources

Grype can scan a variety of sources beyond those found in Docker.

```
# scan a container image archive (from the result of `docker image save ...`, `podman save ...`, or `skopeo copy` commands)
grype path/to/image.tar

# scan a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container
grype path/to/image.sif

# scan a directory
grype dir:path/to/dir
```

Sources can be explicitly provided with a scheme:

```
podman:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Podman daemon
docker:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Docker daemon
docker-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar   use a tarball from disk for archives created from &quot;docker save&quot;
oci-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar      use a tarball from disk for OCI archives (from Skopeo or otherwise)
oci-dir:path/to/yourimage              read directly from a path on disk for OCI layout directories (from Skopeo or otherwise)
singularity:path/to/yourimage.sif      read directly from a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container on disk
dir:path/to/yourproject                read directly from a path on disk (any directory)
file:path/to/yourfile                  read directly from a file on disk
sbom:path/to/syft.json                 read Syft JSON from path on disk
registry:yourrepo/yourimage:tag        pull image directly from a registry (no container runtime required)
```

If an image source is not provided and cannot be detected from the given reference it is assumed the image should be pulled from the Docker daemon.
If docker is not present, then the Podman daemon is attempted next, followed by reaching out directly to the image registry last.


This default behavior can be overridden with the `default-image-pull-source` configuration option (See [Configuration](https://github.com/anchore/grype#configuration) for more details).

Use SBOMs for even faster vulnerability scanning in Grype:

```
# Then scan for new vulnerabilities as frequently as needed
grype sbom:./sbom.json

# (You can also pipe the SBOM into Grype)
cat ./sbom.json | grype
```

Grype supports input of [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)
SBOM formats. If Syft has generated any of these file types, they should have the appropriate information to work properly with Grype.
It is also possible to use SBOMs generated by other tools with varying degrees of success. Two things that make Grype matching
more successful are the inclusion of CPE and Linux distribution information. If an SBOM does not include any CPE information, it
is possible to generate these based on package information using the `--add-cpes-if-none` flag. To specify a distribution,
use the `--distro &lt;distro&gt;:&lt;version&gt;` flag. A full example is:

```
grype --add-cpes-if-none --distro alpine:3.10 sbom:some-alpine-3.10.spdx.json
```

## Threat &amp; Risk Prioritization

This section explains the columns and UI cues that help prioritize remediation efforts:

- **Severity**: String-based severity derived from CVSS scores that indicates the significance of a vulnerability in levels.
  This balances concerns such as ease of exploitability, and the potential to affect
  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of software and services.

- **EPSS**:
  [Exploit Prediction Scoring System](https://www.first.org/epss/model) is a metric expressing the likelihood
  that a vulnerability will be 
  exploited in the wild over the next 30 days (on a 0–1 scale); higher values signal a greater likelihood of 
  exploitation.
  The table output shows the EPSS percentile, a one-way transform of the EPSS score showing the 
  proportion of all scored vulnerabilities with an equal or lower probability.
  Percentiles linearize a heavily skewed distribution, making threshold choice (e.g. “only CVEs above the 
  90th percentile”) straightforward.

- **KEV Indicator**: Flags entries from CISA’s [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
  --an authoritative list of flaws observed being exploited in the wild.

- **Risk Score**: A composite 0–100 metric calculated as:
  ```markdown
  risk = min(1, threat * average(severity)) * 100
  ```
  Where: 
  - `severity` is the average of all CVSS scores and string severity for a vulnerability (scaled between 0–1).
  - `threat` is the EPSS score (between 0–1). If the vulnerability is on the KEV list then `threat` is 
    `1.05`, or `1.1` if the vulnerability is associated with a ransomware campaign.
  This metric is one way to combine EPSS and CVSS suggested in the [EPSS user guide](https://www.first.org/epss/user-guide).

- **Suggested Fixes**: All possible fixes for a package are listed, however, when multiple fixes are available, we de-emphasize all 
  upgrade paths except for the minimal upgrade path (which highlights the smallest, safest version bump).

Results default to sorting by Risk Score and can be overridden with `--sort-by &lt;value&gt;`:

- `severity`: sort by severity
- `epss`: sort by EPSS percentile (aka, &quot;threat&quot;)
- `risk`: sort by risk score
- `kev`: just like risk, except that KEV entries are always above non-KEV entries
- `package`: sort by package name, version, type
- `vulnerability`: sort by vulnerability ID

### Supported versions

Software updates are always applied to the latest version of Grype; fixes are not backported to any previous versions of Grype.

In terms of database updates, any version of Grype before v0.51.0 (Oct 2022, before schema v5) will not receive
vulnerability database updates. You can still build vulnerability databases for unsupported Grype releases by using previous
releases of [vunnel](https://github.com/anchore/vunnel) to gather the upstream data and [grype-db](https://github.com/anchore/grype-db)
to build databases for unsupported schemas.

Only the latest database schema is considered to be supported. When a new database schema is introduced then the one it replaces is
marked as deprecated. Deprecated schemas will continue to receive updates for at least one year after they are marked
as deprecated at which point they will no longer be supported.

### Working with attestations
Grype supports scanning SBOMs as input via stdin. Users can use [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to verify attestations
with an SBOM as its content to scan an image for vulnerabilities:
```
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-attestation caphill4/java-spdx-tools:latest \
| jq -r .payload \
| base64 --decode \
| jq -r .predicate.Data \
| grype
```

### Vulnerability Summary

#### Basic Grype Vulnerability Data Shape

```json
 {
  &quot;vulnerability&quot;: {
    ...
  },
  &quot;relatedVulnerabilities&quot;: [
    ...
  ],
  &quot;matchDetails&quot;: [
    ...
  ],
  &quot;artifact&quot;: {
    ...
  }
}
```

- **Vulnerability**: All information on the specific vulnerability that was directly matched on (e.g. ID, severity, CVSS score, fix information, links for more information)
- **RelatedVulnerabilities**: Information pertaining to vulnerabilities found to be related to the main reported vulnerability. Perhaps the vulnerability we matched on was a GitHub Security Advisory, which has an upstream CVE (in the authoritative national vulnerability database). In these cases we list the upstream vulnerabilities here.
- **MatchDetails**: This section tries to explain what we searched for while looking for a match and exactly what details on the package and vulnerability that led to a match.
- **Artifact**: This is a subset of the information that we know about the package (when compared to the [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) json output, we summarize the metadata section).
  This has information about where within the container image or directory we found the package, what kind of package it is, licensing info, pURLs, CPEs, etc.

### Excluding file paths

Grype can exclude files and paths from being scanned within a source by using glob expressions
with one or more `--exclude` parameters:

```
grype &lt;source&gt; --exclude &#039;./out/**/*.json&#039; --exclude /etc
```

**Note:** in the case of _image scanning_, since the entire filesystem is scanned it is
possible to use absolute paths like `/etc` or `/usr/**/*.txt` whereas _directory scans_
exclude files _relative to the specified directory_. For example: scanning `/usr/foo` with
`--exclude ./package.json` would exclude `/usr/foo/package.json` and `--exclude &#039;**/package.json&#039;`
would exclude all `package.json` files under `/usr/foo`. For _directory scans_,
it is required to begin path expressions with `./`, `*/`, or `**/`, all of which
will be resolved _relative to the specified scan directory_. Keep in mind, your shell
may attempt to expand wildcards, so put those parameters in single quotes, like:
`&#039;**/*.json&#039;`.

### External Sources

Grype can be configured to incorporate external data sources for added fidelity in vulnerability matching. This
feature is currently disabled by default. To enable this feature add the following to the grype config:

```yaml
external-sources:
  enable: true
  maven:
    search-upstream-by-sha1: true
    base-url: https://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select
    rate-limit: 300ms # Time between Maven API requests
```

You can also configure the base-url if you&#039;re using another registry as your maven endpoint.

The rate at which Maven API requests are made can be configured to match your environment&#039;s requirements. The default is 300ms between requests.

### Output formats

The output format for Grype is configurable as well:

```
grype &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the formats available are:

- `table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `cyclonedx`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `json`: Use this to get as much information out of Grype as possible!
- `sarif`: Use this option to get a [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) report (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](#using-templates) below.

### Using templates

Grype lets you define custom output formats, using [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). Here&#039;s how it works:

- Define your format as a Go template, and save this template as a file.

- Set the output format to &quot;template&quot; (`-o template`).

- Specify the path to the template file (`-t ./path/to/custom.template`).

- Grype&#039;s template processing uses the same data models as the `json` output format — so if you&#039;re wondering what data is available as you author a template, you can use the output from `grype &lt;image&gt; -o json` as a reference.

**Please note:** Templates can access information about the system they are running on, such as environment variables. You should never run untrusted templates.

There are several example templates in the [templates](https://github.com/anchore/grype/tree/main/templates) directory in the Grype source which can serve as a starting point for a custom output format. For example, [csv.tmpl](https://github.com/anchore/grype/blob/main/templates/csv.tmpl) produces a vulnerability report in CSV (comma separated value) format:

```text
&quot;Package&quot;,&quot;Version Installed&quot;,&quot;Vulnerability ID&quot;,&quot;Severity&quot;
&quot;coreutils&quot;,&quot;8.30-3ubuntu2&quot;,&quot;CVE-2016-2781&quot;,&quot;Low&quot;
&quot;libc-bin&quot;,&quot;2.31-0ubuntu9&quot;,&quot;CVE-2016-10228&quot;,&quot;Negligible&quot;
&quot;libc-bin&quot;,&quot;2.31-0ubuntu9&quot;,&quot;CVE-2020-6096&quot;,&quot;Low&quot;
...
```

You can also find the template for the default &quot;table&quot; output format in the same place.

Grype also includes a vast array of utility templating functions from [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) apart from the default golang [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Functions) to allow users to customize the output from Grype.

### Gating on severity of vulnerabilities

You can have Grype exit with an error if any vulnerabilities are reported at or above the specified severity level. This comes in handy when using Grype within a script or CI pipeline. To do this, use the `--fail-on &lt;severity&gt;` CLI flag.

For example, here&#039;s how you could trigger a CI pipeline failure if any vulnerabilities are found in the `ubuntu:latest` image with a severity of &quot;medium&quot; or higher:

```
grype ubuntu:latest --fail-on medium
```

**Note:** Grype returns exit code `2` on vulnerability errors.

### Specifying matches to ignore

If you&#039;re seeing Grype report **false positives** or any other vulnerability matches that you just don&#039;t want to see, you can tell Grype to **ignore** matches by specifying one or more _&quot;ignore rules&quot;_ in your Grype configuration file (e.g. `~/.grype.yaml`). This causes Grype not to report any vulnerability matches that meet the criteria specified by any of your ignore rules.

Each rule can specify any combination of the following criteria:

- vulnerability ID (e.g. `&quot;CVE-2008-4318&quot;`)
- include vulnerability aliases when matching on a vulnerability ID (set `&quot;include-aliases&quot;` to `true`)
- namespace (e.g. `&quot;nvd&quot;`)
- fix state (allowed valu

ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.

## Documentation

This README is a part of the complete documentation, available [here](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/).

## What It Does

Inspired by [Kubernetes DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns), Kubernetes&#039; cluster-internal DNS server, ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers.
Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/api/) to determine a desired list of DNS records.
_Unlike_ KubeDNS, however, it&#039;s not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly—e.g. [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/).

In a broader sense, ExternalDNS allows you to control DNS records dynamically via Kubernetes resources in a DNS provider-agnostic way.

The [FAQ](docs/faq.md) contains additional information and addresses several questions about key concepts of ExternalDNS.

To see ExternalDNS in action, have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HQ2XgL9YVI) or read this [blogpost](https://codemine.be/posts/20190125-devops-eks-externaldns/).

## The Latest Release

- [current release process](./docs/release.md)

ExternalDNS allows you to keep selected zones (via `--domain-filter`) synchronized with Ingresses and Services of `type=LoadBalancer` and nodes in various DNS providers:

- [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/)
- [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- [AWS Cloud Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/)

- [Myra Security DNS](https://www.myrasecurity.com/en/saasp/application-security/secure-dns/)

ExternalDNS is, by default, aware of the records it is managing, therefore it can safely manage non-empty hosted zones.
We strongly encourage you to set `--txt-owner-id` to a unique value that doesn&#039;t change for the lifetime of your cluster.
You might also want to run ExternalDNS in a dry run mode (`--dry-run` flag) to see the changes to be submitted to your DNS Provider API.

Note that all flags can be replaced with environment variables; for instance,
`--dry-run` could be replaced with `EXTERNAL_DNS_DRY_RUN=1`.

## New providers

No new provider will be added to ExternalDNS _in-tree_.

ExternalDNS has introduced a webhook system, which can be used to add a new provider.
See PR #3063 for all the discussions about it.

Some known providers using webhooks are the ones in the table below.

**NOTE**: The maintainers of ExternalDNS have not reviewed those providers, use them at your own risk and following the license
and usage recommendations provided by the respective projects. The maintainers of ExternalDNS take no responsibility for any issue or damage
from the usage of any externally developed webhook.

## Status of in-tree providers

ExternalDNS supports multiple DNS providers which have been implemented by the [ExternalDNS contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/graphs/contributors).
Maintaining all of those in a central repository is a challenge, which introduces lots of toil and potential risks.

This mean that `external-dns` has begun the process to move providers out of tree. See #4347 for more details.
Those who are interested can create a webhook provider based on an _in-tree_ provider and after submit a PR to reference it here.

We define the following stability levels for providers:

- **Stable**: Used for smoke tests before a release, used in production and maintainers are active.
- **Beta**: Community supported, well tested, but maintainers have no access to resources to execute integration tests on the real platform and/or are not using it in production.
- **Alpha**: Community provided with no support from the maintainers apart from reviewing PRs.

The following table clarifies the current status of the providers according to the aforementioned stability levels:

| Provider                        | Status | Maintainers      |
|---------------------------------| ------ |------------------|
| Google Cloud DNS                | Stable |                  |
| AWS Route 53                    | Stable |                  |
| AWS Cloud Map                   | Beta   |                  |

### Running Locally

See the [contributor guide](docs/contributing/dev-guide.md) for details on compiling
from source.

#### Setup Steps

Next, run an application and expose it via a Kubernetes Service:

```console
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80
kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

Annotate the Service with your desired external DNS name. Make sure to change `example.org` to your domain.

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname=nginx.example.org.&quot;
```

Optionally, you can customize the TTL value of the resulting DNS record by using the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl` annotation:

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=10&quot;
```

For more details on configuring TTL, see [here](docs/advanced/ttl.md).

Use the internal-hostname annotation to create DNS records with ClusterIP as the target.

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname=nginx.internal.example.org.&quot;
```

If the service is not of type Loadbalancer you need the --publish-internal-services flag.

Locally run a single sync loop of ExternalDNS.

```console
external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service --once --dry-run
```

This should output the DNS records it will modify to match the managed zone with the DNS records you desire.
It also assumes you are running in the `default` namespace. See the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for more information regarding namespaces.

Note: TXT records will have the `my-cluster-id` value embedded. Those are used to ensure that ExternalDNS is aware of the records it manages.

Once you&#039;re satisfied with the result, you can run ExternalDNS like you would run it in your cluster: as a control loop, and **not in dry-run** mode:

```console
external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service
```

Check that ExternalDNS has created the desired DNS record for your Service and that it points to its load balancer&#039;s IP. Then try to resolve it:

```console
dig +short nginx.example.org.
104.155.60.49
```

Now you can experiment and watch how ExternalDNS makes sure that your DNS records are configured as desired. Here are a couple of things you can try out:

- Change the desired hostname by modifying the Service&#039;s annotation.
- Recreate the Service and see that the DNS record will be updated to point to the new load balancer IP.
- Add another Service to create more DNS records.
- Remove Services to clean up your managed zone.

The **tutorials** section contains examples, including Ingress resources, and shows you how to set up ExternalDNS in different environments such as other cloud providers and alternative Ingress controllers.

# Note

If using a txt registry and attempting to use a CNAME the `--txt-prefix` must be set to avoid conflicts. Changing `--txt-prefix` will result in lost ownership over previously created records.

If `externalIPs` list is defined for a `LoadBalancer` service, this list will be used instead of an assigned load balancer IP to create a DNS record.
It&#039;s useful when you run bare metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT or in a similar setup, where a load balancer IP differs from a public IP (e.g. with [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf)).

## Contributing

Are you interested in contributing to external-dns? We, the maintainers and community, would love your
suggestions, contributions, and help! Also, the maintainers can be contacted at any time to learn more
about how to get involved.

We also encourage ALL active community participants to act as if they are maintainers, even if you don&#039;t have
&quot;official&quot; write permissions. This is a community effort, we are here to serve the Kubernetes community. If you
have an active interest and you want to get involved, you have real power! Don&#039;t assume that the only people who
can get things done around here are the &quot;maintainers&quot;. We also would love to add more &quot;official&quot; maintainers, so
show us what you can do!

The external-dns project is currently in need of maintainers for specific DNS providers. Ideally each provider
would have at least two maintainers. It would be nice if the maintainers run the provider in production, but it
is not strictly required. Provider listed [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns#status-of-in-tree-providers)
that do not have a maintainer listed are in need of assistance.

Read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and have a look at [the contributing docs](docs/contributing/dev-guide.md) to learn about building the project, the project structure, and the purpose of each package.

For an overview on how to write new Sources and Providers check out [Sources and Providers](docs/contributing/sources-and-providers.md).

## Heritage

ExternalDNS is an effort to unify the following similar projects in order to bring the Kubernetes community an easy and predictable way of managing DNS records across cloud providers based on their Kubernetes resources:

- Kops&#039; [DNS Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/HEAD/dns-controller)
- Zalando&#039;s [Mate](https://github.com/linki/mate)
- Molecule Software&#039;s [route53-kubernetes](https://github.com/wearemolecule/route53-kubernetes)

✨ **`samber/lo` is a Lodash-style Go library based on Go 1.18+ Generics.**

A utility library based on Go 1.18+ generics that makes it easier to work with slices, maps, strings, channels, and functions. It provides dozens of handy methods to simplify common coding tasks and improve code readability. It may look like [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) in some aspects.

5 to 10 helpers may overlap with those from the Go standard library, in packages `slices` and `maps`. I feel this library is legitimate and offers many more valuable abstractions.

&lt;/p&gt;

**Why this name?**

I wanted a **short name**, similar to &quot;Lodash&quot;, and no Go package uses this name.

![lo](img/logo-full.png)

## 🚀 Install

```sh
go get github.com/samber/lo@v1
```

This library is v1 and follows SemVer strictly.

No breaking changes will be made to exported APIs before v2.0.0.

This library has no dependencies outside the Go standard library.

## 💡 Usage

You can import `lo` using:

```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;
    lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;
    lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;
    loi &quot;github.com/samber/lo/it&quot;
)
```

Then use one of the helpers below:

```go
names := lo.Uniq([]string{&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Samuel&quot;})
// []string{&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;John&quot;}
```

### Tips for lazy developers

I cannot recommend it, but in case you are too lazy for repeating `lo.` everywhere, you can import the entire library into the namespace.

```go
import (
    . &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;
)
```

I take no responsibility for this junk. 😁 💩

### Filter

Iterates over a collection and returns a slice of all the elements the predicate function returns `true` for.

```go
even := lo.Filter([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int, index int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0
})
// []int{2, 4}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/Apjg3WeSi7K)]

Mutable: like `lo.Filter()`, but the slice is updated in place.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
newList := lom.Filter(list, func(x int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0
})

list
// []int{2, 4, 3, 4}

newList
// []int{2, 4}
```

### Map

Manipulates a slice of one type and transforms it into a slice of another type:

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, index int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)
})
// []string{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/OkPcYAhBo0D)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.Map()`, but the mapper function is called in a goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, _ int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)
})
// []string{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/sCJaB3quRMC)]

Mutable: like `lo.Map()`, but the slice is updated in place.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
lom.Map(list, func(x int) int {
    return x*2
})
// []int{2, 4, 6, 8}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/0jY3Z0B7O_5)]

### UniqMap

Manipulates a slice and transforms it to a slice of another type with unique values.

```go
type User struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
users := []User{{Name: &quot;Alex&quot;, Age: 10}, {Name: &quot;Alex&quot;, Age: 12}, {Name: &quot;Bob&quot;, Age: 11}, {Name: &quot;Alice&quot;, Age: 20}}

names := lo.UniqMap(users, func(u User, index int) string {
    return u.Name
})
// []string{&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/fygzLBhvUdB)]

### FilterMap

Returns a slice obtained after both filtering and mapping using the given callback function.

The callback function should return two values: the result of the mapping operation and whether the result element should be included or not.

```go
matching := lo.FilterMap([]string{&quot;cpu&quot;, &quot;gpu&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;keyboard&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) (string, bool) {
    if strings.HasSuffix(x, &quot;pu&quot;) {
        return &quot;xpu&quot;, true
    }
    return &quot;&quot;, false
})
// []string{&quot;xpu&quot;, &quot;xpu&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/-AuYXfy7opz)]

### FlatMap

Manipulates a slice and transforms and flattens it to a slice of another type. The transform function can either return a slice or a `nil`, and in the `nil` case no value is added to the final slice.

```go
lo.FlatMap([]int64{0, 1, 2}, func(x int64, _ int) []string {
    return []string{
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
    }
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/YSoYmQTA8-U)]

### Reduce

Reduces a collection to a single value. The value is calculated by accumulating the result of running each element in the collection through an accumulator function. Each successive invocation is supplied with the return value returned by the previous call.

```go
sum := lo.Reduce([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(agg int, item int, _ int) int {
    return agg + item
}, 0)
// 10
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/R4UHXZNaaUG)]

### ReduceRight

Like `lo.Reduce` except that it iterates over elements of collection from right to left.

```go
result := lo.ReduceRight([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}, func(agg []int, item []int, _ int) []int {
    return append(agg, item...)
}, []int{})
// []int{4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/Fq3W70l7wXF)]

### ForEach

Iterates over elements of a collection and invokes the function over each element.

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.ForEach([]string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints &quot;hello\nworld\n&quot;
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/oofyiUPRf8t)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.ForEach()`, but the callback is called as a goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.ForEach([]string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints &quot;hello\nworld\n&quot; or &quot;world\nhello\n&quot;
```

### ForEachWhile

Iterates over collection elements and invokes iteratee for each element collection return value decide to continue or break, like do while().

```go
list := []int64{1, 2, -42, 4}

lo.ForEachWhile(list, func(x int64, _ int) bool {
	if x &lt; 0 {
		return false
	}
	fmt.Println(x)
	return true
})
// 1
// 2
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/QnLGt35tnow)]

### Times

Times invokes the iteratee n times, returning a slice of the results of each invocation. The iteratee is invoked with index as argument.

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/vgQj3Glr6lT)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.Times()`, but callback is called in goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

### Uniq

Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice.

```go
uniqValues := lo.Uniq([]int{1, 2, 2, 1})
// []int{1, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/DTzbeXZ6iEN)]

### UniqBy

Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice. It accepts `iteratee` which is invoked for each element in the slice to generate the criterion by which uniqueness is computed.

```go
uniqValues := lo.UniqBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// []int{0, 1, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/g42Z3QSb53u)]

### GroupBy

Returns an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

groups := lo.GroupBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 3}, 1: []int{1, 4}, 2: []int{2, 5}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/XnQBd_v6brd)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.GroupBy()`, but callback is called in goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.GroupBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 3}, 1: []int{1, 4}, 2: []int{2, 5}}
```

### GroupByMap

Returns an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

groups := lo.GroupByMap([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) (int, int) {
    return i%3, i*2
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 6}, 1: []int{2, 8}, 2: []int{4, 10}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/iMeruQ3_W80)]

### Chunk

Returns a slice of elements split into groups of length size. If the slice can&#039;t be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.

```go
lo.Chunk([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2)
// [][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}

lo.Chunk([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2)
// [][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6}}

lo.Chunk([]int{}, 2)
// [][]int{}

lo.Chunk([]int{0}, 2)
// [][]int{{0}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/kEMkFbdu85g)]

### PartitionBy

Returns a slice of elements split into groups. The order of grouped values is determined by the order they occur in collection. The grouping is generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

partitions := lo.PartitionBy([]int{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(x int) string {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        return &quot;negative&quot;
    } else if x%2 == 0 {
        return &quot;even&quot;
    }
    return &quot;odd&quot;
})
// [][]int{{-2, -1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 5}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/NfQ_nGjkgXW)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.PartitionBy()`, but callback is called in goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

partitions := lop.PartitionBy([]int{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(x int) string {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        return &quot;negative&quot;
    } else if x%2 == 0 {
        return &quot;even&quot;
    }
    return &quot;odd&quot;
})
// [][]int{{-2, -1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 5}}
```

### Flatten

Returns a slice a single level deep.

```go
flat := lo.Flatten([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 5}})
// []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/rbp9ORaMpjw)]

### Interleave

Round-robin alternating input slices and sequentially appending value at index into result.

```go
interleaved := lo.Interleave([]int{1, 4, 7}, []int{2, 5, 8}, []int{3, 6, 9})
// []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

interleaved := lo.Interleave([]int{1}, []int{2, 5, 8}, []int{3, 6}, []int{4, 7, 9, 10})
// []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/-RJkTLQEDVt)]

### Shuffle

Returns a slice of shuffled values. Uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.

⚠️ This helper is **mutable**.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
lom.Shuffle(list)

list
// []int{1, 4, 0, 3, 5, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/2xb3WdLjeSJ)]

### Reverse

Reverses a slice so that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second to last, and so on.

⚠️ This helper is **mutable**.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
lom.Reverse(list)

list
// []int{5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/O-M5pmCRgzV)]

### Fill

Fills elements of a slice with `initial` value.

```go
type foo struct {
  bar string
}

func (f foo) Clone() foo {
  return foo{f.bar}
}

initializedSlice := lo.Fill([]foo{foo{&quot;a&quot;}, foo{&quot;a&quot;}}, foo{&quot;b&quot;})
// []foo{foo{&quot;b&quot;}, foo{&quot;b&quot;}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/VwR34GzqEub)]

### Repeat

Builds a slice with N copies of initial value.

```go
type foo struct {
  bar string
}

func (f foo) Clone() foo {
  return foo{f.bar}
}

slice := lo.Repeat(2, foo{&quot;a&quot;})
// []foo{foo{&quot;a&quot;}, foo{&quot;a&quot;}}

&lt;br/&gt;

Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups of containers.
Podman runs containers on Linux, but can also be used on Mac and Windows systems using a Podman-managed virtual machine.
Podman is based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management that is also contained in this repository. The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes.

Podman releases a new major or minor release 4 times a year, during the second week of February, May, August, and November. Patch releases are more frequent and may occur at any time to get bugfixes out to users. All releases are PGP signed. Public keys of members of the team approved to make releases are located [here](https://github.com/containers/release-keys/tree/main/podman).

  * [Downloads](DOWNLOADS.md)

## Overview and scope

At a high level, the scope of Podman and libpod is the following:

* Support for multiple container image formats, including OCI and Docker images.
* Full management of those images, including pulling from various sources (including trust and verification), creating (built via Containerfile or Dockerfile or committed from a container), and pushing to registries and other storage backends.
* Full management of container lifecycle, including creation (both from an image and from an exploded root filesystem), running, checkpointing and restoring (via CRIU), and removal.
* Full management of container networking, using Netavark.
* Support for pods, groups of containers that share resources and are managed together.
* Support for running containers and pods without root or other elevated privileges.
* Resource isolation of containers and pods.
* Support for a Docker-compatible CLI interface, which can both run containers locally and on remote systems.
* No manager daemon, for improved security and lower resource utilization at idle.
* Support for a REST API providing both a Docker-compatible interface and an improved interface exposing advanced Podman functionality.
* Support for running on Windows and Mac via virtual machines run by `podman machine`.

## Roadmap

The future of Podman feature development can be found in its **[roadmap](ROADMAP.md)**.

## Communications

If you think you&#039;ve identified a security issue in the project, please *DO NOT* report the issue publicly via the GitHub issue tracker, mailing list, or IRC.
Instead, send an email with as many details as possible to `security@lists.podman.io`. This is a private mailing list for the core maintainers.

For general questions and discussion, please use Podman&#039;s
[channels](https://podman.io/community/#slack-irc-matrix-and-discord).

For discussions around issues/bugs and features, you can use the GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues)
and
[PRs](https://github.com/containers/podman/pulls)
tracking system.

There is also a [mailing list](https://lists.podman.io/archives/) at `lists.podman.io`.
You can subscribe by sending a message to `podman-join@lists.podman.io` with the subject `subscribe`.

## Rootless
Podman can be easily run as a normal user, without requiring a setuid binary.
When run without root, Podman containers use user namespaces to set root in the container to the user running Podman.
Rootless Podman runs locked-down containers with no privileges that the user running the container does not have.
Some of these restrictions can be lifted (via `--privileged`, for example), but rootless containers will never have more privileges than the user that launched them.
If you run Podman as your user and mount in `/etc/passwd` from the host, you still won&#039;t be able to change it, since your user doesn&#039;t have permission to do so.

Almost all normal Podman functionality is available, though there are some [shortcomings](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/rootless.md).
Any recent Podman release should be able to run rootless without any additional configuration, though your operating system may require some additional configuration detailed in the [install guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

A little configuration by an administrator is required before rootless Podman can be used, the necessary setup is documented [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md).

## Podman Desktop

[Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) provides a local development environment for Podman and Kubernetes on Linux, Windows, and Mac machines.
It is a full-featured desktop UI frontend for Podman which uses the `podman machine` backend on non-Linux operating systems to run containers.
It supports full container lifecycle management (building, pulling, and pushing images, creating and managing containers, creating and managing pods, and working with Kubernetes YAML).
The project develops on [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop) and contributions are welcome.

## Out of scope

* Specialized signing and pushing of images to various storage backends.
  See [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/) for those tasks.
* Support for the Kubernetes CRI interface for container management.
  The [CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) daemon specializes in that.

## OCI Projects Plans

Podman uses OCI projects and best of breed libraries for different aspects:
- Runtime: We use the [OCI runtime tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) to generate OCI runtime configurations that can be used with any OCI-compliant runtime, like [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun/) and [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/).
- Images: Image management uses the [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image) library.
- Storage: Container and image storage is managed by [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage).
- Networking: Networking support through use of [Netavark](https://github.com/containers/netavark) and [Aardvark](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns).  Rootless networking is handled via [pasta](https://passt.top/passt) or [slirp4netns](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns).
- Builds: Builds are supported via [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah).
- Conmon: [Conmon](https://github.com/containers/conmon) is a tool for monitoring OCI runtimes, used by both Podman and CRI-O.
- Seccomp: A unified [Seccomp](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/pkg/seccomp/seccomp.json) policy for Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O.

## Buildah and Podman relationship

Buildah and Podman are two complementary open-source projects that are
available on most Linux platforms and both projects reside at
[GitHub.com](https://github.com) with Buildah
[here](https://github.com/containers/buildah) and Podman
[here](https://github.com/containers/podman).  Both, Buildah and Podman are
command line tools that work on Open Container Initiative (OCI) images and
containers.  The two projects differentiate in their specialization.

Buildah specializes in building OCI images.  Buildah&#039;s commands replicate all
of the commands that are found in a Dockerfile.  This allows building images
with and without Dockerfiles while not requiring any root privileges.
Buildah’s ultimate goal is to provide a lower-level coreutils interface to
build images.  The flexibility of building images without Dockerfiles allows
for the integration of other scripting languages into the build process.
Buildah follows a simple fork-exec model and does not run as a daemon
but it is based on a comprehensive API in golang, which can be vendored
into other tools.

Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify
OCI images, such as pulling and tagging.  It also allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers
created from those images.  For building container images via Dockerfiles, Podman uses Buildah&#039;s
golang API and can be installed independently from Buildah.

A major difference between Podman and Buildah is their concept of a container.  Podman
allows users to create &quot;traditional containers&quot; where the intent of these containers is
to be long lived.  While Buildah containers are really just created to allow content
to be added back to the container image.  An easy way to think of it is the
`buildah run` command emulates the RUN command in a Dockerfile while the `podman run`
command emulates the `docker run` command in functionality.  Because of this and their underlying
storage differences, you can not see Podman containers from within Buildah or vice versa.

In short, Buildah is an efficient way to create OCI images while Podman allows
you to manage and maintain those images and containers in a production environment using
familiar container cli commands.  For more details, see the
[Container Tools Guide](https://github.com/containers/buildah/tree/main/docs/containertools).

Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

* Documentation and Tutorials: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul]
* Forum: [Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/consul)

Consul provides several key features:

* **Multi-Datacenter** - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can
  support any number of regions without complex configuration.

* **Service Mesh** - Consul Service Mesh enables secure service-to-service
  communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Applications
  can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS
  connections for inbound and outbound connections with Transparent Proxy.

* **API Gateway** - Consul API Gateway manages access to services within Consul Service Mesh, 
  allow users to define traffic and authorization policies to services deployed within the mesh.  

* **Service Discovery** - Consul makes it simple for services to register
  themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface.
  External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.

* **Health Checking** - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert
  operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service
  discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service
  level circuit breakers.

* **Dynamic App Configuration** - An HTTP API that allows users to store indexed objects within Consul,
  for storing configuration parameters and application metadata.

Consul runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows and includes an
optional [browser based UI](https://demo.consul.io). A commercial version
called [Consul Enterprise](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/enterprise) is also
available.

**Please note**: We take Consul&#039;s security and our users&#039; trust very seriously. If you
believe you have found a security issue in Consul, please [responsibly disclose](https://www.hashicorp.com/security#vulnerability-reporting)
by contacting us at security@hashicorp.com.

## About

The gRPC-Gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler
[protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).
It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which
translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the
[`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotations in your service definitions.

This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/assets/images/architecture_introduction_diagram.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Docs

You can read our docs at:

- https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/

## Testimonials

&gt; We use the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of API requests per day,
&gt; and have been since 2018 and through all of that,
&gt; we have never had any issues with it.
&gt;
&gt; _- William Mill, [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/)_

## Background

gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming
languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is
combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional
RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining
backward-compatibility, supporting languages or clients that are not well supported by
gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful
JSON architecture.

This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.
A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all
that&#039;s needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.

## Installation

### Compile from source

The following instructions assume you are using
[Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) for dependency
management. Use a
[tool dependency](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
to track the versions of the following executable packages:

```go
// +build tools

package tools

import (
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot;
)
```

Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running

```sh
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

Starting from Go 1.24, the `tool` directive in `go.mod` provides a structured way to track and manage executable dependencies. This replaces the previous workaround of using a separate `tools.go` file with blank imports.

#### **Tracking Tools in `go.mod`**

Instead of manually importing tool dependencies in a Go source file, you can now use the `tool` directive in `go.mod` to declare the tools your project depends on. For example:

```go
module tools

go 1.24

tool (
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
	google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
	google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
)
```

#### **Managing Tool Dependencies**

To add tools to your module, use the `-tool` flag with `go get`:

```sh
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
go get -tool google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
go get -tool google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This automatically updates `go.mod`, adding the tools under the `tool` directive along with `require` statements to ensure version tracking.

### Install Tools

Once the tool dependencies are properly recorded in the `go.mod` file, simply execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
go install tool
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### Download the binaries

You may alternatively download the binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
We generate [SLSA3 signatures](slsa.dev) using the OpenSSF&#039;s [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) during the release process. To verify a release binary:

1. Install the verification tool from [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation).
2. Download the provenance file `attestation.intoto.jsonl` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
3. Run the verifier:

```shell
slsa-verifier -artifact-path &lt;the-binary&gt; -provenance attestation.intoto.jsonl -source github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway -tag &lt;the-tag&gt;
```

Alternatively, see the section on remotely managed plugin versions below.

## Usage

### 1.Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers

`your_service.proto`:

```protobuf
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;

 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
   rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
 }
```

### 2. Generate gRPC stubs

This step generates the gRPC stubs that you can use to implement the service and consume from clients:

Here&#039;s an example `buf.gen.yaml` you can use to generate the stubs with [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf):

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

With this file in place, you can generate your files using `buf generate`.

&gt; For a complete example of using `buf generate` to generate protobuf stubs, see
&gt; [the boilerplate repo](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).
&gt; For more information on generating the stubs with buf, see
&gt; [the official documentation](https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage).

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, here&#039;s an example of what a command
might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . \
    --go_out ./gen/go/ --go_opt paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out ./gen/go/ --go-grpc_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 3. Implement your service in gRPC as usual.

### 4. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

At this point, you have 3 options:

- no further modifications, use the default mapping to HTTP semantics (method, path, etc.)
  - this will work on any `.proto` file, but will not allow setting HTTP paths, request parameters or similar
- additional `.proto` modifications to use a custom mapping
  - relies on parameters in the `.proto` file to set custom HTTP mappings
- no `.proto` modifications, but use an external configuration file
  - relies on an external configuration file to set custom HTTP mappings
  - mostly useful when the source proto file isn&#039;t under your control

#### 1. Using the default mapping

This requires no additional modification to the `.proto` file but does require enabling a specific option when executing the plugin.
The `generate_unbound_methods` should be enabled.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt generate_unbound_methods=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 2. With custom annotations

Add a [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotation to your .proto file

`your_service.proto`:

```diff
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;
+
+import &quot;google/api/annotations.proto&quot;;
+
 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
-  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
+  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
+    option (google.api.http) = {
+      post: &quot;/v1/example/echo&quot;
+      body: &quot;*&quot;
+    };
+  }
 }
```

&gt; You will need to provide the required third party protobuf files to the protobuf compiler.
&gt; If you are using [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf), this dependency can
&gt; be added to the `deps` array in your `buf.yaml` under the name
&gt; `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis`:
&gt;
&gt; ```yaml
&gt; version: v2
&gt; name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
&gt; deps:
&gt;   - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; Always run `buf dep update` after adding a dependency to your `buf.yaml`.

See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
and generated OpenAPI output.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you need to ensure the required
dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found
by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from the
[googleapis repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), and providing
them to `protoc` when running. The files you will need are:

```
google/api/annotations.proto
google/api/field_behavior.proto
google/api/http.proto
google/api/httpbody.proto
```

Here&#039;s what a `protoc` execution might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 3. External configuration

If you do not want to (or cannot) modify the proto file for use with gRPC-Gateway you can
alternatively use an external
[gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
[Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/)
for more information. This is best combined with the `standalone=true` option
to generate a file that can live in its own package, separate from the files
generated by the source protobuf file.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml \
    --grpc-gateway_opt standalone=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 5. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;flag&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog&quot;

  gw &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/proto/gen/go/your/service/v1/your_service&quot;  // Update
)

var (
  // command-line options:
  // gRPC server endpoint
  grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String(&quot;grpc-server-endpoint&quot;,  &quot;localhost:9090&quot;, &quot;gRPC server endpoint&quot;)
)

func run() error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()

  // Register gRPC server endpoint
  // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
  mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
  opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
  err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
  return http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8081&quot;, mux)
}

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  if err := run(); err != nil {
    grpclog.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

### 6. (Optional) Generate OpenAPI definitions using `protoc-gen-openapiv2`

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
  - local: protoc-gen-openapiv2
    out: gen/go
```

To use the custom protobuf annotations supported by `protoc-gen-openapiv2`, we need
another dependency added to our protobuf generation step. If you are using
`buf`, you can add the `buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway` dependency
to your `deps` array:

```yaml
version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
  - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
```

With `protoc` (just the swagger file):

```sh
protoc -I . --openapiv2_out ./gen/openapiv2 \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you will need to copy the protobuf
files from the `protoc-gen-openapiv2/options` directory of this repository,
and providing them to `protoc` when running.

Note that this plugin also supports generating OpenAPI definitions for unannotated methods;
use the `generate_unbound_methods` option to enable this.

It is possible with the HTTP mapping for a gRPC service method to create duplicate mappings
with the only difference being constraints on the path parameter.

`/v1/{name=projects/*}` and `/v1/{name=organizations/*}` both become `/v1/{name}`. When
this occurs the plugin will rename the path parameter with a &quot;\_1&quot; (or &quot;\_2&quot; etc) suffix
to differentiate the different operations. So in the above example, the 2nd path would become
`/v1/{name_1=organizations/*}`. This can also cause OpenAPI clients to URL encode the &quot;/&quot; that is
part of the path parameter as that is what OpenAPI defines in the specification. To allow gRPC gateway to
accept the URL encoded slash and still route the request, use the UnescapingModeAllCharacters or
UnescapingModeLegacy (which is the default currently though may change in future versions). See
[Customizing Your Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/)
for more information.

## Usage with remote plugins

As an alternative to all of the above, you can use `buf` with
[remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage)
to manage plugin versions and generation. An example `buf.gen.yaml` using remote
plugin generation looks like this:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.31.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.3.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/openapiv2:v2.16.2
    out: gen/openapiv2
```

This requires no local installation of any plugins. Be careful to use the same
version of the generator as the runtime library, i.e. if using `v2.16.2`, run

```shell
$ go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2@v2.16.2
```

To get the same version of the runtime in your `go.mod`.

Note that usage of remote plugins is incompatible with usage of external configuration files like [grpc_api_configuration](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/#using-an-external-configuration-file).

## Video intro

This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro to using the gRPC-Gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base: https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Parameters and flags

When using `buf` to generate stubs, flags and parameters are passed through
the `opt` field in your `buf.gen.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

During code generation with `protoc`, flags to gRPC-Gateway tools must be passed
through `protoc` using one of 2 patterns:

- as part of the `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out` `protoc` parameter: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out=&lt;flags&gt;:&lt;path&gt;`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
--openapiv2_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
```

- using additional `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt` parameters: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt=&lt;flag&gt;[,&lt;flag&gt;]*`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
--openapiv2_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
```

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to
receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need
to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support
open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to
multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

Objectives:

- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.
- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.
- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.
- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.
- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.

## Community

The OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)
channel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via
video calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:

- meet the humans behind the project
- get an opinion about specific proposals
- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack
- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously

We rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to
allow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:

Tuesday:

- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)

Wednesday:

- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)
- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)

Contributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.
Post a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong
reasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to
identify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.

Remember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the
relevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull
request where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous
calls and don&#039;t want them to feel excluded.

## Supported OTLP version

This code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,
considered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability
definition
here.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)

## Stability levels

See [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.

## Compatibility

When used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.

Support for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:

1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.
2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.

Official OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.

## Verifying the images signatures

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.

We are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:

```console
$ cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt; \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  &lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;
```

where:

- `&lt;RELEASE_TAG&gt;`: is the release that you want to validate
- `&lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&gt;`: is the image that you want to check

Example:

```console
$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0

Verification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
