## 🔨 Installation

For binary builds, Docker images, RPM &amp; DEB packages, and other builds of
Telegraf, please see the [install guide](/docs/INSTALL_GUIDE.md).

See the [releases documentation](/docs/RELEASES.md) for details on versioning
and when releases are made.

## 💻 Usage

Users define a TOML configuration with the plugins and settings they wish to
use, then pass that configuration to Telegraf. The Telegraf agent then
collects data from inputs at each interval and sends data to outputs at each
flush interval.

For a basic walkthrough see [quick start](/docs/QUICK_START.md).

## 📖 Documentation

For a full list of documentation including tutorials, reference and other
material, start with the [/docs directory](/docs/README.md).

Additionally, each plugin has its own README that includes details about how to
configure, use, and sometimes debug or troubleshoot. Look under the
[/plugins directory](/plugins/) for specific plugins.

Here are some commonly used documents:

* [Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md)
* [Configuration](/docs/CONFIGURATION.md)
* [FAQ](/docs/FAQ.md)
* [Releases](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/releases)

## Installation

Use a package manager:

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install charmbracelet/tap/crush

# NPM
npm install -g @charmland/crush

# Arch Linux (btw)
yay -S crush-bin

# Nix
nix run github:numtide/nix-ai-tools#crush
```

Windows users:

```bash
# Winget
winget install charmbracelet.crush

# Scoop
scoop bucket add charm https://github.com/charmbracelet/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install crush
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nix (NUR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Crush is available via [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) in `nur.repos.charmbracelet.crush`.

You can also try out Crush via `nix-shell`:

```bash
# Add the NUR channel.
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/main.tar.gz nur
nix-channel --update

# Get Crush in a Nix shell.
nix-shell -p &#039;(import &lt;nur&gt; { pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}; }).repos.charmbracelet.crush&#039;
```

### NixOS &amp; Home Manager Module Usage via NUR

Crush provides NixOS and Home Manager modules via NUR.
You can use these modules directly in your flake by importing them from NUR. Since it auto detects whether its a home manager or nixos context you can use the import the exact same way :)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nur.url = &quot;github:nix-community/NUR&quot;;
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nur, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
      modules = [
        nur.modules.nixos.default
        nur.repos.charmbracelet.modules.crush
        {
          programs.crush = {
            enable = true;
            settings = {
              providers = {
                openai = {
                  id = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  name = &quot;OpenAI&quot;;
                  base_url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1&quot;;
                  type = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  api_key = &quot;sk-fake123456789abcdef...&quot;;
                  models = [
                    {
                      id = &quot;gpt-4&quot;;
                      name = &quot;GPT-4&quot;;
                    }
                  ];
                };
              };
              lsp = {
                go = { command = &quot;gopls&quot;; enabled = true; };
                nix = { command = &quot;nil&quot;; enabled = true; };
              };
              options = {
                context_paths = [ &quot;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&quot; ];
                tui = { compact_mode = true; };
                debug = false;
              };
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora/RHEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
echo &#039;[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key&#039; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install crush
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Catwalk Badge&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\crush\crush.json`)

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  &quot;this-setting&quot;: { &quot;this&quot;: &quot;that&quot; },
  &quot;that-setting&quot;: [&quot;ceci&quot;, &quot;cela&quot;]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;lsp&quot;: {
    &quot;go&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gopls&quot;,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GOTOOLCHAIN&quot;: &quot;go1.24.5&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;typescript&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;typescript-language-server&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;--stdio&quot;]
    },
    &quot;nix&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nil&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/mcp-server.js&quot;],
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NODE_ENV&quot;: &quot;production&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;$(echo Bearer $EXAMPLE_MCP_TOKEN)&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;streaming-service&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/sse&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;API-Key&quot;: &quot;$(echo $API_KEY)&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don&#039;t want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you&#039;d like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allowed_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;view&quot;,
      &quot;ls&quot;,
      &quot;grep&quot;,
      &quot;edit&quot;,
      &quot;mcp_context7_get-library-doc&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;attribution&quot;: {
      &quot;co_authored_by&quot;: true,
      &quot;generated_with&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

- `co_authored_by`: When true (default), adds `Co-Authored-By: Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;` to commit messages
- `generated_with`: When true (default), adds `💘 Generated with Crush` line to commit messages and PR descriptions

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;ollama&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ollama&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen3:30b&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;lmstudio&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;LM Studio&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:1234/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don&#039;t forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;deepseek&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deepseek V3&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 0.27,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 0.07,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 64000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;custom-anthropic&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anthropic&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.anthropic.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;extra_headers&quot;: {
        &quot;anthropic-version&quot;: &quot;2023-06-01&quot;
      },
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Claude Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;vertexai&quot;: {
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4@20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VertexAI Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;debug&quot;: true,
    &quot;debug_lsp&quot;: true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_provider_auto_update&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
crush update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
crush update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at crush at build time.
crush update-providers embedded

# For more info:
crush update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Crush records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code ([here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/blob/main/internal/llm/agent/event.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Or by setting the following in your config:

```json
{
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_metrics&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Crush also respects the [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://consoledonottrack.com)
convention which can be enabled via `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

## A Note on Claude Max and GitHub Copilot

Crush only supports model providers through official, compliant APIs. We do not
support or endorse any methods that rely on personal Claude Max and GitHub
Copilot accounts or OAuth workarounds, which violate Anthropic and
Microsoft’s Terms of Service.

We’re committed to building sustainable, trusted integrations with model
providers. If you’re a provider interested in working with us,
[reach out](mailto:vt100@charm.sh).

2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of your repository with the following content:

   ```
   repos:
     - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
       rev: v8.24.2
       hooks:
         - id: gitleaks
   ```

   for a [native execution of gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases) or use the [`gitleaks-docker` pre-commit ID](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml) for executing gitleaks using the [official Docker images](#docker)

3. Auto-update the config to the latest repos&#039; versions by executing `pre-commit autoupdate`
4. Install with `pre-commit install`
5. Now you&#039;re all set!

```
➜ git commit -m &quot;this commit contains a secret&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets.................................................Failed
```

Note: to disable the gitleaks pre-commit hook you can prepend `SKIP=gitleaks` to the commit command
and it will skip running gitleaks

```
➜ SKIP=gitleaks git commit -m &quot;skip gitleaks check&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets................................................Skipped
```

### Commands

⚠️ v8.19.0 introduced a change that deprecated `detect` and `protect`. Those commands are still available but
are hidden in the `--help` menu. Take a look at this [gist](https://gist.github.com/zricethezav/b325bb93ebf41b9c0b0507acf12810d2) for easy command translations.
If you find v8.19.0 broke an existing command (`detect`/`protect`), please open an issue.

There are three scanning modes: `git`, `dir`, and `stdin`.

#### Git

The `git` command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, gitleaks uses the `git log -p` command to scan patches.
You can configure the behavior of `git log -p` with the `log-opts` option.
For example, if you wanted to run gitleaks on a range of commits you could use the following
command: `gitleaks git -v --log-opts=&quot;--all commitA..commitB&quot; path_to_repo`. See the [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) documentation for more information.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.

#### Dir

The `dir` (aliases include `files`, `directory`) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: `gitleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file`.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will scan the current working directory.

#### Stdin

You can also stream data to gitleaks with the `stdin` command. Example: `cat some_file | gitleaks -v stdin`

### Creating a baseline

When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline,
gitleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any gitleaks report. To create a gitleaks report, run gitleaks with the `--report-path` parameter.

```
gitleaks git --report-path gitleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called gitleaks-report.json
```

Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:

```
gitleaks git --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json
```

After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.

## Pre-Commit hook

You can run Gitleaks as a pre-commit hook by copying the example `pre-commit.py` script into
your `.git/hooks/` directory.

## Load Configuration

The order of precedence is:

1. `--config/-c` option:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git --config /home/dev/customgitleaks.toml .
      ```
2. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` with the file path:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG=&quot;/home/dev/customgitleaks.toml&quot;
      gitleaks git .
      ```
3. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` with the file content:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML=`cat customgitleaks.toml`
      gitleaks git .
      ```
4. A `.gitleaks.toml` file within the target path:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git .
      ```

If none of the four options are used, then gitleaks will use the default config.

## Configuration

Gitleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:

```toml
# Title for the gitleaks configuration file.
title = &quot;Custom Gitleaks configuration&quot;

# You have basically two options for your custom configuration:
#
# 1. define your own configuration, default rules do not apply
#
#    use e.g., the default configuration as starting point:
#    https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
#
# 2. extend a configuration, the rules are overwritten or extended
#
#    When you extend a configuration the extended rules take precedence over the
#    default rules. I.e., if there are duplicate rules in both the extended
#    configuration and the default configuration the extended rules or
#    attributes of them will override the default rules.
#    Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain
#    together multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are
#    appended and can contain duplicates.

# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the default gitleaks config built in to the binary
# the latest version is located at:
# https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can provide a path to a configuration to extend from.
# The path is relative to where gitleaks was invoked,
# not the location of the base config.

Refer to the default [gitleaks config](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml) for examples or follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to the default configuration. Additionally, you can check out [this gitleaks blog post](https://blog.gitleaks.io/stop-leaking-secrets-configuration-2-3-aeed293b1fbf) which covers advanced configuration setups.

### Additional Configuration

#### Composite Rules (Multi-part or `required` Rules)
In v8.28.0 Gitleaks introduced composite rules, which are made up of a single &quot;primary&quot; rule and one or more auxiliary or `required` rules. To create a composite rule, add a `[[rules.required]]` table to the primary rule specifying an `id` and optionally `withinLines` and/or `withinColumns` proximity constraints. A fragment is a chunk of content that Gitleaks processes at once (typically a file, part of a file, or git diff), and proximity matching instructs the primary rule to only report a finding if the auxiliary `required` rules also find matches within the specified area of the fragment.

**Proximity matching:** Using the `withinLines` and `withinColumns` fields instructs the primary rule to only report a finding if the auxiliary `required` rules also find matches within the specified proximity. You can set:

- **`withinLines: N`** - required findings must be within N lines (vertically)
- **`withinColumns: N`** - required findings must be within N characters (horizontally)  
- **Both** - creates a rectangular search area (both constraints must be satisfied)
- **Neither** - fragment-level matching (required findings can be anywhere in the same fragment)

Here are diagrams illustrating each proximity behavior:

```
p = primary captured secret
a = auxiliary (required) captured secret
fragment = section of data gitleaks is looking at


    *Fragment-level proximity*

![Moby Project logo](docs/static_files/moby-project-logo.png &quot;The Moby Project&quot;)

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.

It provides a &quot;Lego set&quot; of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.

## Principles

Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set its direction.

- Modular: the project includes lots of components that have well-defined functions and APIs that work together.
- Batteries included but swappable: Moby includes enough components to build fully featured container systems, but its modular architecture ensures that most of the components can be swapped by different implementations.
- Usable security: Moby provides secure defaults without compromising usability.
- Developer focused: The APIs are intended to be functional and useful to build powerful tools.
They are not necessarily intended as end user tools but as components aimed at developers.
Documentation and UX is aimed at developers not end users.

## Audience

The Moby Project is intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent and build systems based on containers.
It is not for people looking for a commercially supported system, but for people who want to work and learn with open source code.

## Relationship with Docker

The components and tools in the Moby Project are initially the open source components that Docker and the community have built for the Docker Project.
New projects can be added if they fit with the community goals. Docker is committed to using Moby as the upstream for the Docker Product.
However, other projects are also encouraged to use Moby as an upstream, and to reuse the components in diverse ways, and all these uses will be treated in the same way. External maintainers and contributors are welcomed.

The Moby project is not intended as a location for support or feature requests for Docker products, but as a place for contributors to work on open source code, fix bugs, and make the code more useful.
The releases are supported by the maintainers, community and users, on a best efforts basis only. For customers who want enterprise or commercial support, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/) are the appropriate products for these use cases.

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary
archives are published at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.23 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  Command   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`geth`** | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options) for command line options. |
|   `clef`   | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  `devp2p`  | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  `abigen`  | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy-to-use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings) page for details.                                  |
|   `evm`    | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `rlpdump`  | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp)) dumps (data encoding used by the Ethereum protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user-friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`).                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we&#039;ve enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

Minimum:

* CPU with 4+ cores
* 8GB RAM
* 1TB free storage space to sync the Mainnet
* 8 MBit/sec download Internet service

Recommended:

* Fast CPU with 8+ cores
* 16GB+ RAM
* High-performance SSD with at least 1TB of free space
* 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum
network: create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this
particular use case, the user doesn&#039;t care about years-old historical data, so we can
sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:

```shell
$ geth console
```

This command will:
 * Start `geth` in snap sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
   of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start the built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/javascript-console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/blob/0.20.7/DOCUMENTATION.md) 
   (note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
   as well as `geth`&#039;s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach it to an already running
   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.

### A Full node on the Holesky test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you&#039;d like to play around with creating Ethereum
contracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until
you get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main
network, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to
the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```shell
$ geth --holesky console
```

The `console` subcommand has the same meaning as above and is equally
useful on the testnet too.

Specifying the `--holesky` flag, however, will reconfigure your `geth` instance a bit:

 * Instead of connecting to the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the Holesky 
   test network, which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis
   states.
 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), `geth`
   will nest itself one level deeper into a `holesky` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/holesky` on
   Linux). Note, on OSX and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node
   requires the use of a custom endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a
   production node endpoint by default, e.g.,
   `geth attach &lt;datadir&gt;/holesky/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by
   this.

*Note: Although some internal protective measures prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should always
use separate accounts for play and real money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

#### Docker quick start

One of the quickest ways to get Ethereum up and running on your machine is by using
Docker:

```shell
docker run -d --name ethereum-node -v /Users/alice/ethereum:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           ethereum/client-go
```

This will start `geth` in snap-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB, as the
above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for
saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag
available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers
and/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints are not
accessible from the outside.

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you&#039;ll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you&#039;d expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API&#039;s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API&#039;s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You&#039;ll need to use your own programming environments&#039; capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you&#039;ll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for
granted in the official networks need to be manually set up.

Unfortunately since [the Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/) it is no longer possible
to easily set up a network of geth nodes without also setting up a corresponding beacon chain.

There are three different solutions depending on your use case:

  * If you are looking for a simple way to test smart contracts from go in your CI, you can use the [Simulated Backend](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings#blockchain-simulator).
  * If you want a convenient single node environment for testing, you can use our [Dev Mode](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/dev-mode).
  * If you are looking for a multiple node test network, you can set one up quite easily with [Kurtosis](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/kurtosis).

![OAuth2 Proxy](docs/static/img/logos/OAuth2_Proxy_horizontal.svg)

OAuth2-Proxy is a flexible, open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. It provides a simple and secure way to protect your web applications with OAuth2 / OIDC authentication. As a reverse proxy, it intercepts requests to your application and redirects users to an OAuth2 provider for authentication. As a middleware, it can be seamlessly integrated into your existing infrastructure to handle authentication for multiple applications.

OAuth2-Proxy supports a lot of OAuth2 as well as OIDC providers. Either through a generic OIDC client or a specific implementation for Google, Microsoft Entra ID, GitHub, login.gov and others. Through specialised provider implementations oauth2-proxy can extract more details about the user like preferred usernames and groups. Those details can then be forwarded as HTTP headers to your upstream applications.

![Simplified Architecture](docs/static/img/simplified-architecture.svg)

## Get Started

OAuth2-Proxy&#039;s [Installation Docs](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/installation) cover how to install and configure your setup. Additionally you can take a further look at the [example setup files](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/tree/master/contrib/local-environment).

## Releases

### Binaries
We publish oauth2-proxy as compiled binaries on GitHub for all major architectures as well as more exotic ones like `ppc64le` as well as `s390x`.

Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/latest).

### Images

From `v7.6.0` and up the base image has been changed from Alpine to [GoogleContainerTools/distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).
This image comes with even fewer installed dependencies and thus should improve security. The image therefore is also slightly smaller than Alpine.
For debugging purposes (and those who really need it. e.g. `armv6`) we still provide images based on Alpine. The tags of these images are suffixed with `-alpine`.

Since 2023-11-18 we build nightly images directly from the `master` branch and provide them at `quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy-nightly`.
These images are considered unstable and therefore should **NOT** be used for production purposes unless you know what you&#039;re doing.

Package `gorilla/mux` implements a request router and dispatcher for matching incoming requests to
their respective handler.

The name mux stands for &quot;HTTP request multiplexer&quot;. Like the standard `http.ServeMux`, `mux.Router` matches incoming requests against a list of registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL or other conditions. The main features are:

* It implements the `http.Handler` interface so it is compatible with the standard `http.ServeMux`.
* Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes, header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
* URL hosts, paths and query values can have variables with an optional regular expression.
* Registered URLs can be built, or &quot;reversed&quot;, which helps maintaining references to resources.
* Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes. As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.

## Install

With a [correctly configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) Go toolchain:

```sh
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```

## Examples

Let&#039;s start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:

```go
func main() {
    r := mux.NewRouter()
    r.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, HomeHandler)
    r.HandleFunc(&quot;/products&quot;, ProductsHandler)
    r.HandleFunc(&quot;/articles&quot;, ArticlesHandler)
    http.Handle(&quot;/&quot;, r)
}
```

Here we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is equivalent to how `http.HandleFunc()` works: if an incoming request URL matches one of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing (`http.ResponseWriter`, `*http.Request`) as parameters.

Paths can have variables. They are defined using the format `{name}` or `{name:pattern}`. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched variable will be anything until the next slash. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc(&quot;/products/{key}&quot;, ProductHandler)
r.HandleFunc(&quot;/articles/{category}/&quot;, ArticlesCategoryHandler)
r.HandleFunc(&quot;/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}&quot;, ArticleHandler)
```

The names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved calling `mux.Vars()`:

```go
func ArticlesCategoryHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    vars := mux.Vars(r)
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    fmt.Fprintf(w, &quot;Category: %v\n&quot;, vars[&quot;category&quot;])
}
```

And this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options are explained below.

### Matching Routes

Routes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host pattern to be matched. They can also have variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
// Only matches if domain is &quot;www.example.com&quot;.
r.Host(&quot;www.example.com&quot;)
// Matches a dynamic subdomain.
r.Host(&quot;{subdomain:[a-z]+}.example.com&quot;)
```

There are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:

```go
r.PathPrefix(&quot;/products/&quot;)
```

...or HTTP methods:

```go
r.Methods(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;)
```

...or URL schemes:

```go
r.Schemes(&quot;https&quot;)
```

...or header values:

```go
r.Headers(&quot;X-Requested-With&quot;, &quot;XMLHttpRequest&quot;)
```

...or query values:

```go
r.Queries(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;)
```

...or to use a custom matcher function:

```go
r.MatcherFunc(func(r *http.Request, rm *RouteMatch) bool {
    return r.ProtoMajor == 0
})
```

...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:

```go
r.HandleFunc(&quot;/products&quot;, ProductsHandler).
  Host(&quot;www.example.com&quot;).
  Methods(&quot;GET&quot;).
  Schemes(&quot;http&quot;)
```

Routes are tested in the order they were added to the router. If two routes match, the first one wins:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc(&quot;/specific&quot;, specificHandler)
r.PathPrefix(&quot;/&quot;).Handler(catchAllHandler)
```

Setting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have a way to group several routes that share the same requirements. We call it &quot;subrouting&quot;.

For example, let&#039;s say we have several URLs that should only match when the host is `www.example.com`. Create a route for that host and get a &quot;subrouter&quot; from it:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host(&quot;www.example.com&quot;).Subrouter()
```

Then register routes in the subrouter:

```go
s.HandleFunc(&quot;/products/&quot;, ProductsHandler)
s.HandleFunc(&quot;/products/{key}&quot;, ProductHandler)
s.HandleFunc(&quot;/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}&quot;, ArticleHandler)
```

The three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is `www.example.com`, because the subrouter is tested first. This is not only convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create subrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.

Subrouters can be used to create domain or path &quot;namespaces&quot;: you define subrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its paths relatively to a given subrouter.

There&#039;s one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix, the inner routes use it as base for their paths:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.PathPrefix(&quot;/products&quot;).Subrouter()
// &quot;/products/&quot;
s.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, ProductsHandler)
// &quot;/products/{key}/&quot;
s.HandleFunc(&quot;/{key}/&quot;, ProductHandler)
// &quot;/products/{key}/details&quot;
s.HandleFunc(&quot;/{key}/details&quot;, ProductDetailsHandler)
```


### Static Files

Note that the path provided to `PathPrefix()` represents a &quot;wildcard&quot;: calling
`PathPrefix(&quot;/static/&quot;).Handler(...)` means that the handler will be passed any
request that matches &quot;/static/\*&quot;. This makes it easy to serve static files with mux:

```go
func main() {
    var dir string

    flag.StringVar(&amp;dir, &quot;dir&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;the directory to serve files from. Defaults to the current dir&quot;)
    flag.Parse()
    r := mux.NewRouter()

    // This will serve files under http://localhost:8000/static/&lt;filename&gt;
    r.PathPrefix(&quot;/static/&quot;).Handler(http.StripPrefix(&quot;/static/&quot;, http.FileServer(http.Dir(dir))))

    srv := &amp;http.Server{
        Handler:      r,
        Addr:         &quot;127.0.0.1:8000&quot;,
        // Good practice: enforce timeouts for servers you create!
        WriteTimeout: 15 * time.Second,
        ReadTimeout:  15 * time.Second,
    }

    log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServe())
}
```

### Serving Single Page Applications

Most of the time it makes sense to serve your SPA on a separate web server from your API,
but sometimes it&#039;s desirable to serve them both from one place. It&#039;s possible to write a simple
handler for serving your SPA (for use with React Router&#039;s [BrowserRouter](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter) for example), and leverage
mux&#039;s powerful routing for your API endpoints.

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;encoding/json&quot;
	&quot;log&quot;
	&quot;net/http&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;
	&quot;path/filepath&quot;
	&quot;time&quot;

	&quot;github.com/gorilla/mux&quot;
)

// spaHandler implements the http.Handler interface, so we can use it
// to respond to HTTP requests. The path to the static directory and
// path to the index file within that static directory are used to
// serve the SPA in the given static directory.
type spaHandler struct {
	staticPath string
	indexPath  string
}

// ServeHTTP inspects the URL path to locate a file within the static dir
// on the SPA handler. If a file is found, it will be served. If not, the
// file located at the index path on the SPA handler will be served. This
// is suitable behavior for serving an SPA (single page application).
func (h spaHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Join internally call path.Clean to prevent directory traversal
	path := filepath.Join(h.staticPath, r.URL.Path)

	// check whether a file exists or is a directory at the given path
	fi, err := os.Stat(path)
	if os.IsNotExist(err) || fi.IsDir() {
		// file does not exist or path is a directory, serve index.html
		http.ServeFile(w, r, filepath.Join(h.staticPath, h.indexPath))
		return
	}

	if err != nil {
		// if we got an error (that wasn&#039;t that the file doesn&#039;t exist) stating the
		// file, return a 500 internal server error and stop
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
	}

	// otherwise, use http.FileServer to serve the static file
	http.FileServer(http.Dir(h.staticPath)).ServeHTTP(w, r)
}

func main() {
	router := mux.NewRouter()

	router.HandleFunc(&quot;/api/health&quot;, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// an example API handler
		json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]bool{&quot;ok&quot;: true})
	})

	spa := spaHandler{staticPath: &quot;build&quot;, indexPath: &quot;index.html&quot;}
	router.PathPrefix(&quot;/&quot;).Handler(spa)

	srv := &amp;http.Server{
		Handler: router,
		Addr:    &quot;127.0.0.1:8000&quot;,
		// Good practice: enforce timeouts for servers you create!
		WriteTimeout: 15 * time.Second,
		ReadTimeout:  15 * time.Second,
	}

	log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServe())
}
```

### Registered URLs

Now let&#039;s see how to build registered URLs.

Routes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built, or &quot;reversed&quot;. We define a name calling `Name()` on a route. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc(&quot;/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}&quot;, ArticleHandler).
  Name(&quot;article&quot;)
```

To build a URL, get the route and call the `URL()` method, passing a sequence of key/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
url, err := r.Get(&quot;article&quot;).URL(&quot;category&quot;, &quot;technology&quot;, &quot;id&quot;, &quot;42&quot;)
```

...and the result will be a `url.URL` with the following path:

```
&quot;/articles/technology/42&quot;
```

This also works for host and query value variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.Host(&quot;{subdomain}.example.com&quot;).
  Path(&quot;/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}&quot;).
  Queries(&quot;filter&quot;, &quot;{filter}&quot;).
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name(&quot;article&quot;)

// url.String() will be &quot;http://news.example.com/articles/technology/42?filter=gorilla&quot;
url, err := r.Get(&quot;article&quot;).URL(&quot;subdomain&quot;, &quot;news&quot;,
                                 &quot;category&quot;, &quot;technology&quot;,
                                 &quot;id&quot;, &quot;42&quot;,
                                 &quot;filter&quot;, &quot;gorilla&quot;)
```

All variables defined in the route are required, and their values must conform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a generated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is for explicitly defined &quot;build-only&quot; routes which never match.

Regex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:

```go
r.HeadersRegexp(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/(text|json)&quot;)
```

...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as `application/text`

There&#039;s also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route: use the methods `URLHost()` or `URLPath()` instead. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
// &quot;http://news.example.com/&quot;
host, err := r.Get(&quot;article&quot;).URLHost(&quot;subdomain&quot;, &quot;news&quot;)

// &quot;/articles/technology/42&quot;
path, err := r.Get(&quot;article&quot;).URLPath(&quot;category&quot;, &quot;technology&quot;, &quot;id&quot;, &quot;42&quot;)
```

And if you use subrouters, host and path defined separately can be built as well:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host(&quot;{subdomain}.example.com&quot;).Subrouter()
s.Path(&quot;/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}&quot;).
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name(&quot;article&quot;)

// &quot;http://news.example.com/articles/technology/42&quot;
url, err := r.Get(&quot;article&quot;).URL(&quot;subdomain&quot;, &quot;news&quot;,
                                 &quot;category&quot;, &quot;technology&quot;,
                                 &quot;id&quot;, &quot;42&quot;)
```

To find all the required variables for a given route when calling `URL()`, the method `GetVarNames()` is available:
```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.Host(&quot;{domain}&quot;).
    Path(&quot;/{group}/{item_id}&quot;).
    Queries(&quot;some_data1&quot;, &quot;{some_data1}&quot;).
    Queries(&quot;some_data2&quot;, &quot;{some_data2}&quot;).
    Name(&quot;article&quot;)

// Will print [domain group item_id some_data1 some_data2] &lt;nil&gt;
fmt.Println(r.Get(&quot;article&quot;).GetVarNames())

```
### Walking Routes

The `Walk` function on `mux.Router` can be used to visit all of the routes that are registered on a router. For example,
the following prints all of the registered routes:

```go
package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;net/http&quot;
	&quot;strings&quot;

	&quot;github.com/gorilla/mux&quot;
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	return
}

func main() {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, handler)
	r.HandleFunc(&quot;/products&quot;, handler).Methods(&quot;POST&quot;)
	r.HandleFunc(&quot;/articles&quot;, handler).Methods(&quot;GET&quot;)
	r.HandleFunc(&quot;/articles/{id}&quot;, handler).Methods(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;PUT&quot;)
	r.HandleFunc(&quot;/authors&quot;, handler).Queries(&quot;surname&quot;, &quot;{surname}&quot;)
	err := r.Walk(func(route *mux.Route, router *mux.Router, ancestors []*mux.Route) error {
		pathTemplate, err := route.GetPathTemplate()
		if err == nil {
			fmt.Println(&quot;ROUTE:&quot;, pathTemplate)
		}
		pathRegexp, err := route.GetPathRegexp()
		if err == nil {

### Graceful Shutdown

Go 1.8 introduced the ability to [gracefully shutdown](https://golang.org/doc/go1.8#http_shutdown) a `*http.Server`. Here&#039;s how to do that alongside `mux`:

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;context&quot;
    &quot;flag&quot;
    &quot;log&quot;
    &quot;net/http&quot;
    &quot;os&quot;
    &quot;os/signal&quot;
    &quot;time&quot;

    &quot;github.com/gorilla/mux&quot;
)

func main() {
    var wait time.Duration
    flag.DurationVar(&amp;wait, &quot;graceful-timeout&quot;, time.Second * 15, &quot;the duration for which the server gracefully wait for existing connections to finish - e.g. 15s or 1m&quot;)
    flag.Parse()

    r := mux.NewRouter()
    // Add your routes as needed

    srv := &amp;http.Server{
        Addr:         &quot;0.0.0.0:8080&quot;,
        // Good practice to set timeouts to avoid Slowloris attacks.
        WriteTimeout: time.Second * 15,
        ReadTimeout:  time.Second * 15,
        IdleTimeout:  time.Second * 60,
        Handler: r, // Pass our instance of gorilla/mux in.
    }

    // Run our server in a goroutine so that it doesn&#039;t block.
    go func() {
        if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
        }
    }()

    c := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    // We&#039;ll accept graceful shutdowns when quit via SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
    // SIGKILL, SIGQUIT or SIGTERM (Ctrl+/) will not be caught.
    signal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt)

    // Block until we receive our signal.
    &lt;-c

    // Create a deadline to wait for.
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), wait)
    defer cancel()
    // Doesn&#039;t block if no connections, but will otherwise wait
    // until the timeout deadline.
    srv.Shutdown(ctx)
    // Optionally, you could run srv.Shutdown in a goroutine and block on
    // &lt;-ctx.Done() if your application should wait for other services
    // to finalize based on context cancellation.
    log.Println(&quot;shutting down&quot;)
    os.Exit(0)
}
```

### Middleware

Mux supports the addition of middlewares to a [Router](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#Router), which are executed in the order they are added if a match is found, including its subrouters.
Middlewares are (typically) small pieces of code which take one request, do something with it, and pass it down to another middleware or the final handler. Some common use cases for middleware are request logging, header manipulation, or `ResponseWriter` hijacking.

Mux middlewares are defined using the de facto standard type:

```go
type MiddlewareFunc func(http.Handler) http.Handler
```

Typically, the returned handler is a closure which does something with the http.ResponseWriter and http.Request passed to it, and then calls the handler passed as parameter to the MiddlewareFunc. This takes advantage of closures being able access variables from the context where they are created, while retaining the signature enforced by the receivers.

A very basic middleware which logs the URI of the request being handled could be written as:

```go
func loggingMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // Do stuff here
        log.Println(r.RequestURI)
        // Call the next handler, which can be another middleware in the chain, or the final handler.
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

Middlewares can be added to a router using `Router.Use()`:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, handler)
r.Use(loggingMiddleware)
```

A more complex authentication middleware, which maps session token to users, could be written as:

```go
// Define our struct
type authenticationMiddleware struct {
	tokenUsers map[string]string
}

// Initialize it somewhere
func (amw *authenticationMiddleware) Populate() {
	amw.tokenUsers[&quot;00000000&quot;] = &quot;user0&quot;
	amw.tokenUsers[&quot;aaaaaaaa&quot;] = &quot;userA&quot;
	amw.tokenUsers[&quot;05f717e5&quot;] = &quot;randomUser&quot;
	amw.tokenUsers[&quot;deadbeef&quot;] = &quot;user0&quot;
}

// Middleware function, which will be called for each request
func (amw *authenticationMiddleware) Middleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        token := r.Header.Get(&quot;X-Session-Token&quot;)

        if user, found := amw.tokenUsers[token]; found {
        	// We found the token in our map
        	log.Printf(&quot;Authenticated user %s\n&quot;, user)
        	// Pass down the request to the next middleware (or final handler)
        	next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
        } else {
        	// Write an error and stop the handler chain
        	http.Error(w, &quot;Forbidden&quot;, http.StatusForbidden)
        }
    })
}
```

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, handler)

amw := authenticationMiddleware{tokenUsers: make(map[string]string)}
amw.Populate()

r.Use(amw.Middleware)
```

Note: The handler chain will be stopped if your middleware doesn&#039;t call `next.ServeHTTP()` with the corresponding parameters. This can be used to abort a request if the middleware writer wants to. Middlewares _should_ write to `ResponseWriter` if they _are_ going to terminate the request, and they _should not_ write to `ResponseWriter` if they _are not_ going to terminate it.

### Handling CORS Requests

[CORSMethodMiddleware](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#CORSMethodMiddleware) intends to make it easier to strictly set the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header.

* You will still need to use your own CORS handler to set the other CORS headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
* The middleware will set the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header to all the method matchers (e.g. `r.Methods(http.MethodGet, http.MethodPut, http.MethodOptions)` -&gt; `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,PUT,OPTIONS`) on a route
* If you do not specify any methods, then:

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## BNB Smart Chain

The goal of BNB Smart Chain is to bring programmability and interoperability to BNB Beacon Chain. In order to embrace the existing popular community and advanced technology, it will bring huge benefits by staying compatible with all the existing smart contracts on Ethereum and Ethereum tooling. And to achieve that, the easiest solution is to develop based on go-ethereum fork, as we respect the great work of Ethereum very much.

BNB Smart Chain starts its development based on go-ethereum fork. So you may see many toolings, binaries and also docs are based on Ethereum ones, such as the name &quot;geth&quot;.

[![API Reference](
https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum?tab=doc)
[![Build Test](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/actions/workflows/build-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/actions)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join%20chat-blue.svg)](https://discord.gg/z2VpC455eU)

But from that baseline of EVM compatible, BNB Smart Chain introduces a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.

**The BNB Smart Chain** will be:

- **A self-sovereign blockchain**: Provides security and safety with elected validators.
- **EVM-compatible**: Supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster finality and cheaper transaction fees.
- **Distributed with on-chain governance**: Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community participants. As the native token, BNB will serve as both the gas of smart contract execution and tokens for staking.

More details in [White Paper](https://github.com/bnb-chain/whitepaper/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md).

## Release Types
There are three types of release, each with a clear purpose and version scheme:

- **1.Stable Release**: production-ready builds for the vast majority of users.  Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;`, example: [v1.5.19](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.19).
- **2.Feature Release**: early access to a single feature without affecting the core product. Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;-feature-&lt;FeatureName&gt;`, example: [v1.5.19-feature-SI](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.19-feature-SI).
- **3.Preview Release**: bleeding-edge builds for users who want the latest code. Format: `v&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;-&lt;Meta&gt;`, Meta values indicate maturity: alpha (experimental), beta (largely complete), rc (release candidate), example: [v1.5.0-alpha](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.5.0-alpha).

## Key features

### Proof of Staked Authority 
Although Proof-of-Work (PoW) has been approved as a practical mechanism to implement a decentralized network, it is not friendly to the environment and also requires a large size of participants to maintain the security. 

Proof-of-Authority(PoA) provides some defense to 51% attack, with improved efficiency and tolerance to certain levels of Byzantine players (malicious or hacked). 
Meanwhile, the PoA protocol is most criticized for being not as decentralized as PoW, as the validators, i.e. the nodes that take turns to produce blocks, have all the authorities and are prone to corruption and security attacks.

Other blockchains, such as EOS and Cosmos both, introduce different types of Deputy Proof of Stake (DPoS) to allow the token holders to vote and elect the validator set. It increases the decentralization and favors community governance. 

To combine DPoS and PoA for consensus, BNB Smart Chain implement a novel consensus engine called Parlia that:

1. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators.
2. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner, similar to Ethereum&#039;s Clique consensus engine.
3. Validator set are elected in and out based on a staking based governance on BNB Smart Chain.
4. Parlia consensus engine will interact with a set of [system contracts](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/staking/overview/#system-contracts) to achieve liveness slash, revenue distributing and validator set renewing func.

## Native Token

BNB will run on BNB Smart Chain in the same way as ETH runs on Ethereum so that it remains as `native token` for BSC. This means,
BNB will be used to:

1. pay `gas` to deploy or invoke Smart Contract on BSC

## Building the source

Many of the below are the same as or similar to go-ethereum.

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.24 or later) and a C compiler (GCC 5 or higher). You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

If you get such error when running the node with self built binary:
```shell
Caught SIGILL in blst_cgo_init, consult &lt;blst&gt;/bindinds/go/README.md.
```
please try to add the following environment variables and build again:
```shell
export CGO_CFLAGS=&quot;-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__&quot; 
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW=&quot;-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__&quot;
```

## Executables

The bsc project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  Command   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`geth`** | Main BNB Smart Chain client binary. It is the entry point into the BSC network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It has the same and more RPC and other interface as go-ethereum and can be used by other processes as a gateway into the BSC network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options. |
|   `clef`   | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  `devp2p`  | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  `abigen`  | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) page for details.                                                                                               |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   `evm`    | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we&#039;ve enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

The hardware must meet certain requirements to run a full node on mainnet:
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
- IMPORTANT 3 TB(Dec 2023) of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 500 MB/S throughput, read latency &lt;1ms. (if node is started with snap sync, it will need NVMe SSD)
- 16 cores of CPU and 64 GB of memory (RAM)
- Suggest m5zn.6xlarge or r7iz.4xlarge instance type on AWS, c2-standard-16 on Google cloud.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 5 MB/S

The requirement for testnet:
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
- 500G of storage for testnet.
- 4 cores of CPU and 16 gigabytes of memory (RAM).

### Steps to Run a Fullnode

#### 1. Download the pre-build binaries
```shell
# Linux
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_linux |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
mv geth_linux geth
chmod -v u+x geth

# MacOS
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_mac |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
mv geth_macos geth
chmod -v u+x geth
```

#### 2. Download the config files
```shell
//== mainnet
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mainnet |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
unzip mainnet.zip

//== testnet
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep testnet |cut -d\&quot; -f4)
unzip testnet.zip
```

#### 3. Download snapshot
Download latest chaindata snapshot from [here](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-snapshots). Follow the guide to structure your files.

#### 4. Start a full node
```shell
## It will run with Path-Base Storage Scheme by default and enable inline state prune, keeping the latest 90000 blocks&#039; history state.
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --history.transactions 0

## It is recommend to run fullnode with `--tries-verify-mode none` if you want high performance and care little about state consistency.
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --history.transactions 0 --tries-verify-mode none
```

#### 5. Monitor node status

Monitor the log from **./node/bsc.log** by default. When the node has started syncing, should be able to see the following output:
```shell
t=2022-09-08T13:00:27+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=177   mgas=17.317   elapsed=31.131ms    mgasps=556.259  number=21,153,429 hash=0x42e6b54ba7106387f0650defc62c9ace3160b427702dab7bd1c5abb83a32d8db dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
t=2022-09-08T13:00:29+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=251   mgas=39.638   elapsed=68.827ms    mgasps=575.900  number=21,153,430 hash=0xa3397b273b31b013e43487689782f20c03f47525b4cd4107c1715af45a88796e dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
t=2022-09-08T13:00:33+0000 lvl=info msg=&quot;Imported new chain segment&quot;             blocks=1    txs=197   mgas=19.364   elapsed=34.663ms    mgasps=558.632  number=21,153,431 hash=0x0c7872b698f28cb5c36a8a3e1e315b1d31bda6109b15467a9735a12380e2ad14 dirty=&quot;0.00 B&quot;
```

#### 6. Interact with fullnode
Start up `geth`&#039;s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/javascript-console),
(via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/) 
(note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
as well as `geth`&#039;s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server).
This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
`geth` instance with `geth attach`.

#### 7. More

More details about [running a node](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/developers/node_operators/full_node/) and [becoming a validator](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-smart-chain/validator/create-val/)

*Note: Although some internal protective measures prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should always
use separate accounts for play and real money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you&#039;ll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
BSC network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/),
[`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc), and [BSC&#039;s JSON-RPC API Reference](rpc/json-rpc-api.md)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you&#039;d expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API&#039;s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API&#039;s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You&#039;ll need to use your own programming environments&#039; capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you&#039;ll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
BSC nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

## Running a bootnode

Bootnodes are super-lightweight nodes that are not behind a NAT and are running just discovery protocol. When you start up a node it should log your enode, which is a public identifier that others can use to connect to your node. 

First the bootnode requires a key, which can be created with the following command, which will save a key to boot.key:

```
bootnode -genkey boot.key
```

This key can then be used to generate a bootnode as follows:

```
bootnode -nodekey boot.key -addr :30311 -network bsc
```

The choice of port passed to -addr is arbitrary. 
The bootnode command returns the following logs to the terminal, confirming that it is running:

```
enode://3063d1c9e1b824cfbb7c7b6abafa34faec6bb4e7e06941d218d760acdd7963b274278c5c3e63914bd6d1b58504c59ec5522c56f883baceb8538674b92da48a96@127.0.0.1:0?discport=30311
Note: you&#039;re using cmd/bootnode, a developer tool.
We recommend using a regular node as bootstrap node for production deployments.

## Supported Models

You can run any compatible GGUF, MLX, or nexa model from 🤗 Hugging Face by using the `&lt;full repo name&gt;`.

### Qualcomm NPU models
&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You need to download the [arm64 with Qualcomm NPU support](https://nexa-model-hub-bucket.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/public/nexa_sdk/downloads/nexa-cli_windows_arm64.exe) and make sure you have Snapdragon® X Elite chip on your laptop.

#### Quick Start (Windows arm64, Snapdragon X Elite)

1. **Login &amp; Get Access Token (required for Pro Models)**  
   - Create an account at [sdk.nexa.ai](https://sdk.nexa.ai)  
   - Go to **Deployment → Create Token**  
   - Run this once in your terminal (replace with your token):  
     ```bash
     nexa config set license &#039;&lt;your_token_here&gt;&#039;
     ```

2. Run and chat with our multimodal model, OmniNeural-4B, or other models on NPU

```bash
nexa infer omni-neural
nexa infer NexaAI/OmniNeural-4B
nexa infer NexaAI/qwen3-1.7B-npu
```


### GGUF models

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; GGUF runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

📝 Run and chat with LLMs, e.g. Qwen3:

```bash
nexa infer ggml-org/Qwen3-1.7B-GGUF
```

🖼️ Run and chat with Multimodal models, e.g. Qwen2.5-Omni:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/Qwen2.5-Omni-3B-GGUF
```

### MLX models
&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; MLX is macOS-only (Apple Silicon). Many MLX models in the Hugging Face mlx-community organization have quality issues and may not run reliably.
&gt; We recommend starting with models from our curated [NexaAI Collection](https://huggingface.co/NexaAI/collections) for best results. For example

📝 Run and chat with LLMs, e.g. Qwen3:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/Qwen3-4B-4bit-MLX
```

🖼️ Run and chat with Multimodal models, e.g. Gemma3n:

```bash
nexa infer NexaAI/gemma-3n-E4B-it-4bit-MLX
```

KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. KEDA serves
as a Kubernetes Metrics Server and allows users to define autoscaling rules using a dedicated Kubernetes custom
resource definition.

KEDA can run on both the cloud and the edge, integrates natively with Kubernetes components such as the Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler, and has no external dependencies.

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.

&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; SSH3 is probably going to change its name. It is still the SSH Connection Protocol (RFC4254) running on top of HTTP/3 Extended connect, but the required changes are heavy and
&gt; too distant from the philosophy of popular SSH implementations to be considered for integration. The [specification draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3/) has already been renamed (&quot;Remote Terminals over HTTP/3&quot;),
&gt; but we need some time to come up with a nice permanent name.

# SSH3: faster and rich secure shell using HTTP/3
SSH3 is a complete revisit of the SSH
protocol, mapping its semantics on top of the HTTP mechanisms. It comes from our research work and we (researchers) recently proposed it as an [Internet-Draft](https://www.ietf.org/how/ids/) ([draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3/)).

In a nutshell, SSH3 uses [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000)+[TLS1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446) for
secure channel establishment and the [HTTP Authorization](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-authorization) mechanisms for user authentication.
Among others, SSH3 allows the following improvements:
- Significantly faster session establishment
- New HTTP authentication methods such as [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) in addition to classical SSH authentication
- Robustness to port scanning attacks: your SSH3 server can be made **invisible** to other Internet users
- UDP port forwarding in addition to classical TCP port forwarding
- All the features allowed by the modern QUIC protocol: including connection migration (soon) and multipath connections

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Quickly want to get started ? Checkout how to [install SSH3](#installing-ssh3). You will learn to [setup an SSH3 server](#deploying-an-ssh3-server) and [use the SSH3 client](#using-the-ssh3-client).

## ⚡ SSH3 is faster
Faster for session establishment, not throughput ! SSH3 offers a significantly faster session establishment than SSHv2. Establishing a new session with SSHv2 can take 5 to 7 network round-trip times, which can easily be noticed by the user. SSH3 only needs 3 round-trip times. The keystroke latency in a running session is unchanged.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;resources/figures/ssh3_100ms_rtt.gif&quot;/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;SSH3 (top) VS SSHv2 (bottom) session establishement with a 100ms ping towards the server.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## 🔒 SSH3 security
While SSHv2 defines its own protocols for user authentication and secure channel establishment, SSH3 relies on the robust and time-tested mechanisms of TLS 1.3, QUIC and HTTP. These protocols are already extensively used to secure security-critical applications on the Internet such as e-commerce and Internet banking.

SSH3 already implements the common password-based and public-key (RSA and EdDSA/ed25519) authentication methods. It also supports new authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and allows logging in to your servers using your Google/Microsoft/Github accounts.

### 🧪 SSH3 is still experimental
While SSH3 shows promise for faster session establishment, it is still at an early proof-of-concept stage. As with any new complex protocol, **expert cryptographic review over an extended timeframe is required before reasonable security conclusions can be made**.

We are developing SSH3 as an open source project to facilitate community feedback and analysis. However, we **cannot yet endorse its appropriateness for production systems** without further peer review. Please collaborate with us if you have relevant expertise!

### 🥷 Do not deploy the SSH3 server on your production servers for now
Given the current prototype state, we advise *testing SSH3 in sandboxed environments or private networks*. Be aware that making experimental servers directly Internet-accessible could introduce risk before thorough security vetting.

While [hiding](#-your-ssh3-public-server-can-be-hidden) servers behind secret paths has potential benefits, it does not negate the need for rigorous vulnerability analysis before entering production. We are excited by SSH3&#039;s future possibilities but encourage additional scrutiny first.

## 🥷 Your SSH3 public server can be hidden
Using SSH3, you can avoid the usual stress of scanning and dictionary attacks against your SSH server. Similarly to your secret Google Drive documents, your SSH3 server can be hidden behind a secret link and only answer to authentication attempts that made an HTTP request to this specific link, like the following:

    ssh3-server -bind 192.0.2.0:443 -url-path &lt;my-long-secret&gt;

By replacing `&lt;my-long-secret&gt;` by, let&#039;s say, the random value `M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU`, your SSH3 server will only answer to SSH3 connection attempts made to the URL `https://192.0.2.0:443/M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU` and it will respond a `404 Not Found` to other requests. Attackers and crawlers on the Internet can therefore not detect the presence of your SSH3 server. They will only see a simple web server answering 404 status codes to every request.

**NOTE WELL**: placing your SSH3 server behind a secret URL may reduce the impact of scanning attacks but will and must *never* replace classical authentication mechanisms. The secret link should only be used to avoid your host to be discovered. Knowing the secret URL should not grant someone access to your server. Use the classical authentication mechanisms described above to protect your server. 

## 💐 SSH3 is already feature-rich
SSH3 provides new feature that could not be provided by the SSHv2 protocol.

### Brand new features
- **UDP port forwarding**: you can now access your QUIC, DNS, RTP or any UDP-based server that are only reachable from your SSH3 host.
UDP packets are forwarded using QUIC datagrams.
- **X.509 certificates**: you can now use your classical HTTPS certificates to authenticate your SSH3 server. This mechanism is more secure than the classical SSHv2 host key mechanism. Certificates can be obtained easily using LetsEncrypt for instance.
- **Hiding** your server behind a secret link.
- **Keyless** secure user authentication using **OpenID Connect**. You can connect to your SSH3 server using the SSO of your company or your Google/Github account, and you don&#039;t need to copy the public keys of your users anymore.

### Famous OpenSSH features implemented
This SSH3 implementation already provides many of the popular features of OpenSSH, so if you are used to OpenSSH, the process of adopting SSH3 will be smooth. Here is a list of some OpenSSH features that SSH3 also implements:
- Parses `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server
- Certificate-based server authentication
- `known_hosts` mechanism when X.509 certificates are not used.
- Automatically using the `ssh-agent` for public key authentication
- SSH agent forwarding to use your local keys on your remote server
- Direct TCP port forwarding (reverse port forwarding will be implemented in the future)
- Proxy jump (see the `-proxy-jump` parameter). If A is an SSH3 client and B and C are both SSH3 servers, you can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. The proxy uses UDP forwarding to forward the QUIC packets from A to C, so B cannot decrypt the traffic A&lt;-&gt;C SSH3 traffic.
- Parses `~/.ssh/config` on the client and handles the `Hostname`, `User`, `Port` and `IdentityFile` config options (the other options are currently ignored). Also parses a new `UDPProxyJump` that behaves similarly to OpenSSH&#039;s `ProxyJump`.

## 🙏 Community support
Help us progress SSH3 responsibly! We welcome capable security researchers to review our codebase and provide feedback. Please also connect us with relevant standards bodies to potentially advance SSH3 through the formal IETF/IRTF processes over time.

With collaborative assistance, we hope to iteratively improve SSH3 towards safe production readiness. But we cannot credibly make definitive security claims without evidence of extensive expert cryptographic review and adoption by respected security authorities. Let&#039;s work together to realize SSH3&#039;s possibilities!

## Installing SSH3
You can either download the last [release binaries](https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/releases),
[install it using `go install`](#installing-ssh3-and-ssh3-server-using-go-install) or generate these binaries yourself by compiling the code from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; SSH3 is still experimental and is the fruit of a research work. If you are afraid of deploying publicly a new SSH3 server, you can use the
&gt; [secret path](#-your-ssh3-public-server-can-be-hidden) feature of SSH3 to hide it behing a secret URL.

### Installing ssh3 and ssh3-server using Go install
```bash
go install github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/cmd/...@latest
```



### Compiling SSH3 from source
You need a recent [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/) version to do this.
Downloading the source code and compiling the binaries can be done with the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3    # clone the repo
cd ssh3
go build -o ssh3 cmd/ssh3/main.go                        # build the client
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o ssh3-server cmd/ssh3-server/main.go   # build the server, requires having gcc installed
```

If you have root/sudo privileges and you want to make ssh3 accessible to all you users,
you can then directly copy the binaries to `/usr/bin`:

```bash
cp ssh3 /usr/bin/ &amp;&amp; cp ssh3-server /usr/bin
```

Otherwise, you can simply add the executables to your `PATH` environment variable by adding
the following line at the end of your `.bashrc` or equivalent:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/the/ssh3/directory
```

### Deploying an SSH3 server
Before connecting to your host, you need to deploy an SSH3 server on it. There is currently
no SSH3 daemon, so right now, you will have to run the `ssh3-server` executable in background
using `screen` or a similar utility.


&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; As SSH3 runs on top of HTTP/3, a server needs an X.509 certificate and its corresponding private key. Public certificates can be generated automatically for your public domain name through Let&#039;s Encrypt using the `-generate-public-cert` command-line argument on the server. If you do not want to generate a certificate signed by a real certificate authority or if you don&#039;t have any public domain name, you can generate a self-signed one using the `-generate-selfsigned-cert` command-line argument. Self-signed certificates provide you with similar security guarantees to SSHv2&#039;s host keys mechanism, with the same security issue: you may be vulnerable to machine-in-the-middle attacks during your first connection to your server. Using real certificates signed by public certificate authorities such as Let&#039;s Encrypt avoids this issue.


Here is the usage of the `ssh3-server` executable:

```
Usage of ./ssh3-server:
  -bind string
        the address:port pair to listen to, e.g. 0.0.0.0:443 (default &quot;[::]:443&quot;)
  -cert string
        the filename of the server certificate (or fullchain) (default &quot;./cert.pem&quot;)
  -key string
        the filename of the certificate private key (default &quot;./priv.key&quot;)
  -enable-password-login
        if set, enable password authentication (disabled by default)
  -generate-public-cert value
        Automatically produce and use a valid public certificate usingLet&#039;s Encrypt for the provided domain name. The flag can be used several times to generate several certificates.If certificates have already been generated previously using this flag, they will simply be reused without being regenerated. The public certificates are automatically renewed as long as the server is running. Automatically-generated IP public certificates are not available yet.
  -generate-selfsigned-cert
        if set, generates a self-self-signed cerificate and key that will be stored at the paths indicated by the -cert and -key args (they must not already exist)
  -url-path string
        the secret URL path on which the ssh3 server listens (default &quot;/ssh3-term&quot;)
  -v    verbose mode, if set
  -version
        if set, displays the software version on standard output and exit
```

The following command starts a public SSH3 server on port 443 with a valid Let&#039;s Encrypt public certificate
for domain `my-domain.example.org` and answers to new sessions requests querying the `/ssh3` URL path:

    ssh3-server -generate-public-cert my-domain.example.org -url-path /ssh3

If you don&#039;t have a public domain name (i.e. only an IP address), you can either use an existing certificate
for your IP address using the `-cert` and `-key` arguments or generate a self-signed certificate using the
`-generate-selfsigned-cert` argument.

If you have existing certificates and keys, you can run the server as follows to use them=

    ssh3-server -cert /path/to/cert/or/fullchain -key /path/to/cert/private/key -url-path /ssh3

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Similarly to OpenSSH, the server must be run with root priviledges to log in as other users.

#### Authorized keys and authorized identities
By default, the SSH3 server will look for identities in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `~/.ssh3/authorized_identities` files for each user.
`~/.ssh3/authorized_identities` allows new identities such as OpenID Connect (`oidc`) discussed [below](#openid-connect-authentication-still-experimental).
Popular key types such as `rsa`, `ed25519` and keys in the OpenSSH format can be used.

### Using the SSH3 client
Once you have an SSH3 server running, you can connect to it using the SSH3 client similarly to what
you did with your classical SSHv2 tool.

Here is the usage of the `ssh3` executable:

```
Usage of ssh3:
  -pubkey-for-agent string
        if set, use an agent key whose public key matches the one in the specified path
  -privkey string
        private key file
  -use-password
        if set, do classical password authentication
  -forward-agent
        if set, forwards ssh agent to be used with sshv2 connections on the remote host
  -forward-tcp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -forward-udp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -proxy-jump string
    	if set, performs a proxy jump using the specified remote host as proxy
  -insecure
        if set, skip server certificate verification
  -keylog string
        Write QUIC TLS keys and master secret in the specified keylog file: only for debugging purpose
  -use-oidc string
        if set, force the use of OpenID Connect with the specified issuer url as parameter
  -oidc-config string
        OpenID Connect json config file containing the &quot;client_id&quot; and &quot;client_secret&quot; fields needed for most identity providers
  -do-pkce
        if set, perform PKCE challenge-response with oidc
  -v    if set, enable verbose mode
```

#### Private-key authentication
You can connect to your SSH3 server at my-server.example.org listening on `/my-secret-path` using the private key located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with the following command:

      ssh3 -privkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path

#### Agent-based private key authentication
The SSH3 client works with the OpenSSH agent and uses the classical `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to
communicate with this agent. Similarly to OpenSSH, SSH3 will list the keys provided by the SSH agent
and connect using the first key listen by the agent by default.
If you want to specify a specific key to use with the agent, you can either specify the private key
directly with the `-privkey` argument like above, or specify the corresponding public key using the
`-pubkey-for-agent` argument. This allows you to authenticate in situations where only the agent has
a direct access to the private key but you only have access to the public key.

#### Password-based authentication
While discouraged, you can connect to your server using passwords (if explicitly enabled on the `ssh3-server`)
with the following command:

      ssh3 -use-password username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path

#### Config-based session establishment
`ssh3` parses your OpenSSH config. Currently, it only handles the `Hostname`; `User`, `Port` and `IdentityFile` OpenSSH options.
It also adds new option only used by SSH3, such as `URLPath` or `UDPProxyJump`. `URLPath` allows you to omit the secret URL path in your
SSH3 command. `UDPProxyJump` allows you to perform SSH3 (#proxy-jump)[Proxy Jump] and has the same meaning as the `-proxy-jump` command-line argument.
Let&#039;s say you have the following lines in your OpenSSH config located in `~/.ssh/config` :
```
IgnoreUnknown URLPath
Host my-server
  HostName 192.0.2.0
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  URLPath /my-secret-path
```

Similarly to what OpenSSH does, the following `ssh3` command will connect you to the SSH3 server running on 192.0.2.0 on UDP port 443 using public key authentication with the private key located in `.ssh/id_rsa` :

      ssh3 my-server/my-secret-path

If you do not want a config-based utilization of SSH3, you can read the sections below to see how to use the CLI parameters of `ssh3`.

#### OpenID Connect authentication (still experimental)
This feature allows you to connect using an external identity provider such as the one
of your company or any other provider that implements the OpenID Connect standard, such as Google Identity,
Github or Microsoft Entra. The authentication flow is illustrated in the GIF below.

&lt;img src=&quot;resources/figures/ssh3_oidc.gif&quot; width=75%&gt;

*Secure connection without private key using a Google account.*
&lt;/div&gt;

The way it connects to your identity provider is configured in a file named `~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json`.
Below is an example `config.json` file for use with a Google account. This configuration file is an array
and can contain several identity providers configurations.
```json
[
    {
        &quot;issuer_url&quot;: &quot;https://accounts.google.com&quot;,
        &quot;client_id&quot;: &quot;&lt;your_client_id&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;client_secret&quot;: &quot;&lt;your_client_secret&gt;&quot;
    }
]
```
This might change in the future, but currently, to make this feature work with your Google account, you will need to setup a new experimental application in your Google Cloud console and add your email as authorized users.
This will provide you with a `client_id` and a `client_secret` that you can then set in your `~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json`. On the server side, you just have to add the following line in your `~/.ssh3/authorized_identities`:

```
oidc &lt;client_id&gt; https://accounts.google.com &lt;email&gt;
```
We currently consider removing the need of setting the client_id in the `authorized_identities` file in the future.

#### Proxy jump
It is often the case that some SSH hosts can only be accessed through a gateway. SSH3 allows you to perform a Proxy Jump similarly to what is proposed by OpenSSH.
You can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. B and C must both be running a valid SSH3 server. This works by establishing UDP port forwarding on B to forward QUIC packets from A to C.
The connection from A to C is therefore fully end-to-end and B cannot decrypt or alter the SSH3 traffic between A and C.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># GoDotEnv ![CI](https://github.com/joho/godotenv/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/joho/godotenv)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/joho/godotenv)

A Go (golang) port of the Ruby [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) project (which loads env vars from a .env file).

From the original Library:

&gt; Storing configuration in the environment is one of the tenets of a twelve-factor app. Anything that is likely to change between deployment environments–such as resource handles for databases or credentials for external services–should be extracted from the code into environment variables.
&gt;
&gt; But it is not always practical to set environment variables on development machines or continuous integration servers where multiple projects are run. Dotenv load variables from a .env file into ENV when the environment is bootstrapped.

It can be used as a library (for loading in env for your own daemons etc.) or as a bin command.

There is test coverage and CI for both linuxish and Windows environments, but I make no guarantees about the bin version working on Windows.

## Installation

As a library

```shell
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
```

or if you want to use it as a bin command

go &gt;= 1.17
```shell
go install github.com/joho/godotenv/cmd/godotenv@latest
```

go &lt; 1.17
```shell
go get github.com/joho/godotenv/cmd/godotenv
```

## Usage

Add your application configuration to your `.env` file in the root of your project:

```shell
S3_BUCKET=YOURS3BUCKET
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE
```

Then in your Go app you can do something like

```go
package main

import (
    &quot;log&quot;
    &quot;os&quot;

    &quot;github.com/joho/godotenv&quot;
)

func main() {
  err := godotenv.Load()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(&quot;Error loading .env file&quot;)
  }

  s3Bucket := os.Getenv(&quot;S3_BUCKET&quot;)
  secretKey := os.Getenv(&quot;SECRET_KEY&quot;)

  // now do something with s3 or whatever
}
```

If you&#039;re even lazier than that, you can just take advantage of the autoload package which will read in `.env` on import

```go
import _ &quot;github.com/joho/godotenv/autoload&quot;
```

While `.env` in the project root is the default, you don&#039;t have to be constrained, both examples below are 100% legit

```go
godotenv.Load(&quot;somerandomfile&quot;)
godotenv.Load(&quot;filenumberone.env&quot;, &quot;filenumbertwo.env&quot;)
```

If you want to be really fancy with your env file you can do comments and exports (below is a valid env file)

```shell
# I am a comment and that is OK
SOME_VAR=someval
FOO=BAR # comments at line end are OK too
export BAR=BAZ
```

Or finally you can do YAML(ish) style

```yaml
FOO: bar
BAR: baz
```

as a final aside, if you don&#039;t want godotenv munging your env you can just get a map back instead

```go
var myEnv map[string]string
myEnv, err := godotenv.Read()

s3Bucket := myEnv[&quot;S3_BUCKET&quot;]
```

... or from an `io.Reader` instead of a local file

```go
reader := getRemoteFile()
myEnv, err := godotenv.Parse(reader)
```

... or from a `string` if you so desire

```go
content := getRemoteFileContent()
myEnv, err := godotenv.Unmarshal(content)
```

### Precedence &amp; Conventions

Existing envs take precedence of envs that are loaded later.

The [convention](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#what-other-env-files-can-i-use)
for managing multiple environments (i.e. development, test, production)
is to create an env named `{YOURAPP}_ENV` and load envs in this order:

```go
env := os.Getenv(&quot;FOO_ENV&quot;)
if &quot;&quot; == env {
  env = &quot;development&quot;
}

godotenv.Load(&quot;.env.&quot; + env + &quot;.local&quot;)
if &quot;test&quot; != env {
  godotenv.Load(&quot;.env.local&quot;)
}
godotenv.Load(&quot;.env.&quot; + env)
godotenv.Load() // The Original .env
```

If you need to, you can also use `godotenv.Overload()` to defy this convention
and overwrite existing envs instead of only supplanting them. Use with caution.

### Command Mode

Assuming you&#039;ve installed the command as above and you&#039;ve got `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`

```
godotenv -f /some/path/to/.env some_command with some args
```

If you don&#039;t specify `-f` it will fall back on the default of loading `.env` in `PWD`

By default, it won&#039;t override existing environment variables; you can do that with the `-o` flag.

### Writing Env Files

Godotenv can also write a map representing the environment to a correctly-formatted and escaped file

```go
env, err := godotenv.Unmarshal(&quot;KEY=value&quot;)
err := godotenv.Write(env, &quot;./.env&quot;)
```

... or to a string

```go
env, err := godotenv.Unmarshal(&quot;KEY=value&quot;)
content, err := godotenv.Marshal(env)
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but with some caveats.

This library has been declared feature complete (see [#182](https://github.com/joho/godotenv/issues/182) for background) and will not be accepting issues or pull requests adding new functionality or breaking the library API.

Contributions would be gladly accepted that:

* bring this library&#039;s parsing into closer compatibility with the mainline dotenv implementations, in particular [Ruby&#039;s dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) and [Node.js&#039; dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)
* keep the library up to date with the go ecosystem (ie CI bumps, documentation changes, changes in the core libraries)
* bug fixes for use cases that pertain to the library&#039;s purpose of easing development of codebases deployed into twelve factor environments

*code changes without tests and references to peer dotenv implementations will not be accepted*

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am &#039;Added some feature&#039;`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

## Releases

Releases should follow [Semver](http://semver.org/) though the first couple of releases are `v1` and `v1.1`.

Use [annotated tags for all releases](https://github.com/joho/godotenv/issues/30). Example `git tag -a v1.2.1`

## Who?

The original library [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) was written by [Brandon Keepers](http://opensoul.org/), and this port was done by [John Barton](https://johnbarton.co/) based off the tests/fixtures in the original library.

# Please see [Our Documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for more in-depth installation etc.

kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container &quot;nodes&quot;.
kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

If you have [go] 1.16+ and [docker], [podman] or [nerdctl] installed `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.30.0 &amp;&amp; kind create cluster` is all you need!

![](site/static/images/kind-create-cluster.png)

kind consists of:
- Go [packages][packages] implementing [cluster creation][cluster package], [image build][build package], etc.
- A command line interface ([`kind`][kind cli]) built on these packages.
- Docker [image(s)][images] written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc.
- [`kubetest`][kubetest] integration also built on these packages (WIP)

kind bootstraps each &quot;node&quot; with [kubeadm][kubeadm]. For more details see [the design documentation][design doc].

**NOTE**: kind is still a work in progress, see the [1.0 roadmap].

## Installation and usage

For a complete [install guide] see [the documentation here][install guide].

You can install kind with `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.30.0`.

**NOTE**: please use the latest go to do this. KIND is developed with the latest stable go, see [`.go-version`](./.go-version) for the exact version we&#039;re using.

This will put `kind` in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. If you encounter the error
`kind: command not found` after installation then you may need to either add that directory to your `$PATH` as
shown [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) or do a manual installation by cloning the repo and run
`make build` from the repository.

Without installing go, kind can be built reproducibly with docker using `make build`.

Stable binaries are also available on the [releases] page. Stable releases are
generally recommended for CI usage in particular.
To install, download the binary for your platform from &quot;Assets&quot; and place this
into your `$PATH`:

On Linux:

```console
# For AMD64 / x86_64
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] &amp;&amp; curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-$(uname)-amd64
# For ARM64
[ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] &amp;&amp; curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-$(uname)-arm64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

On macOS via Homebrew:

```console
brew install kind
```

On macOS via MacPorts:

```console
sudo port selfupdate &amp;&amp; sudo port install kind
```

On macOS via Bash:

```console
# For Intel Macs
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] &amp;&amp; curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-darwin-amd64
# For M1 / ARM Macs
[ $(uname -m) = arm64 ] &amp;&amp; curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ./kind
mv ./kind /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind
```

On Windows:

```powershell
curl.exe -Lo kind-windows-amd64.exe https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.30.0/kind-windows-amd64
Move-Item .\kind-windows-amd64.exe c:\some-dir-in-your-PATH\kind.exe

# OR via Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/packages/kind)
choco install kind
```

To use kind, you will need to [install docker].
Once you have docker running you can create a cluster with:

```console
kind create cluster
```

To delete your cluster use:

```console
kind delete cluster
```

&lt;!--TODO(bentheelder): improve this part of the guide--&gt;
To create a cluster from Kubernetes source:
- ensure that Kubernetes is cloned in `$(go env GOPATH)/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`
- build a node image and create a cluster with:
```console
kind build node-image
kind create cluster --image kindest/node:latest
```

Multi-node clusters and other advanced features may be configured with a config
file, for more usage see [the docs][user guide] or run `kind [command] --help`

## What is Argo Workflows?

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.
Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

* Define workflows where each step is a container.
* Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
* Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.

Argo is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/) graduated project.

## Use Cases

* [Machine Learning pipelines](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/machine-learning/)
* [Data and batch processing](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/data-processing/)
* [Infrastructure automation](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/infrastructure-automation/)
* [CI/CD](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/ci-cd/)
* [Other use cases](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/other/)

## Why Argo Workflows?

* Argo Workflows is the most popular workflow execution engine for Kubernetes.
* Light-weight, scalable, and easier to use.
    * Including for Python users through [the Hera Python SDK for Argo Workflows](https://hera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

  &quot;log/slog&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;
)

func main() {
  // Echo instance
  e := echo.New()

  // Middleware
  e.Use(middleware.Logger())
  e.Use(middleware.Recover())

  // Routes
  e.GET(&quot;/&quot;, hello)

  // Start server
  if err := e.Start(&quot;:8080&quot;); err != nil &amp;&amp; !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) {
    slog.Error(&quot;failed to start server&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, err)
  }
}

// Handler
func hello(c echo.Context) error {
  return c.String(http.StatusOK, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
}
```

# DBOS Transact: Lightweight Durable Workflow Orchestration with Postgres

#### [Documentation](https://docs.dbos.dev/) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  [Examples](https://docs.dbos.dev/examples) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [Github](https://github.com/dbos-inc)
&lt;/div&gt;

---

## What is DBOS?

DBOS provides lightweight durable workflow orchestration on top of Postgres. Instead of managing your own workflow orchestrator or task queue system, you can use DBOS to add durable workflows and queues to your program in just a few lines of code.


## When Should I Use DBOS?

You should consider using DBOS if your application needs to **reliably handle failures**.
For example, you might be building a payments service that must reliably process transactions even if servers crash mid-operation, or a long-running data pipeline that needs to resume seamlessly from checkpoints rather than restart from the beginning when interrupted.

Handling failures is costly and complicated, requiring complex state management and recovery logic as well as heavyweight tools like external orchestration services.
DBOS makes it simpler: annotate your code to checkpoint it in Postgres and automatically recover from any failure.
DBOS also provides powerful Postgres-backed primitives that makes it easier to write and operate reliable code, including durable queues, notifications, scheduling, event processing, and programmatic workflow management.


## Features
&lt;details open&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💾 Durable Workflows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
 
DBOS workflows make your program **durable** by checkpointing its state in Postgres.
If your program ever fails, when it restarts all your workflows will automatically resume from the last completed step.

You add durable workflows to your existing Golang program by registering ordinary functions as workflows or running them as steps:

```golang
package main

import (
    &quot;context&quot;
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;os&quot;
    &quot;time&quot;

    &quot;github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-golang/dbos&quot;
)

func workflow(dbosCtx dbos.DBOSContext, _ string) (string, error) {
    _, err := dbos.RunAsStep(dbosCtx, stepOne)
    if err != nil {
        return &quot;&quot;, err
    }
    return dbos.RunAsStep(dbosCtx, stepTwo)
}

func stepOne(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
    fmt.Println(&quot;Step one completed!&quot;)
    return &quot;Step 1 completed&quot;, nil
}

func stepTwo(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
    fmt.Println(&quot;Step two completed!&quot;)
    return &quot;Step 2 completed - Workflow finished successfully&quot;, nil
}

func main() {
    // Initialize a DBOS context
    ctx, err := dbos.NewDBOSContext(context.Background(), dbos.Config{
        DatabaseURL: os.Getenv(&quot;DBOS_SYSTEM_DATABASE_URL&quot;),
        AppName:     &quot;myapp&quot;,
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Register a workflow
    dbos.RegisterWorkflow(ctx, workflow)

    // Launch DBOS
    err = dbos.Launch(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer dbos.Shutdown(ctx, 2 * time.Second)

    // Run a durable workflow and get its result
    handle, err := dbos.RunWorkflow(ctx, workflow, &quot;&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    res, err := handle.GetResult()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(&quot;Workflow result:&quot;, res)
}
```


Workflows are particularly useful for 

- Orchestrating business processes so they seamlessly recover from any failure.
- Building observable and fault-tolerant data pipelines.
- Operating an AI agent, or any application that relies on unreliable or non-deterministic APIs.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📒 Durable Queues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

####

DBOS queues help you **durably** run tasks in the background.
When you enqueue a workflow, one of your processes will pick it up for execution.
DBOS manages the execution of your tasks: it guarantees that tasks complete, and that their callers get their results without needing to resubmit them, even if your application is interrupted.

Queues also provide flow control, so you can limit the concurrency of your tasks on a per-queue or per-process basis.
You can also set timeouts for tasks, rate limit how often queued tasks are executed, deduplicate tasks, or prioritize tasks.

You can add queues to your workflows in just a couple lines of code.
They don&#039;t require a separate queueing service or message broker&amp;mdash;just Postgres.

```golang
package main

import (
    &quot;context&quot;
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;os&quot;
    &quot;time&quot;

    &quot;github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-golang/dbos&quot;
)

func task(ctx dbos.DBOSContext, i int) (int, error) {
    dbos.Sleep(ctx, 5*time.Second)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;Task %d completed\n&quot;, i)
    return i, nil
}

func main() {
    // Initialize a DBOS context
    ctx, err := dbos.NewDBOSContext(context.Background(), dbos.Config{
        DatabaseURL: os.Getenv(&quot;DBOS_SYSTEM_DATABASE_URL&quot;),
        AppName:     &quot;myapp&quot;,
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Register the workflow and create a durable queue
    dbos.RegisterWorkflow(ctx, task)
    queue := dbos.NewWorkflowQueue(ctx, &quot;queue&quot;)

    // Launch DBOS
    err = dbos.Launch(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer dbos.Shutdown(ctx, 2 * time.Second)

    // Enqueue tasks and gather results
    fmt.Println(&quot;Enqueuing workflows&quot;)
    handles := make([]dbos.WorkflowHandle[int], 10)
    for i := range 10 {
        handle, err := dbos.RunWorkflow(ctx, task, i, dbos.WithQueue(queue.Name))
        if err != nil {
            panic(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;failed to enqueue step %d: %v&quot;, i, err))
        }
        handles[i] = handle
    }
    results := make([]int, 10)
    for i, handle := range handles {
        result, err := handle.GetResult()
        if err != nil {
            panic(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;failed to get result for step %d: %v&quot;, i, err))
        }
        results[i] = result
    }
    fmt.Printf(&quot;Successfully completed %d steps\n&quot;, len(results))
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎫 Exactly-Once Event Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

####

Use DBOS to build reliable webhooks, event listeners, or Kafka consumers by starting a workflow exactly-once in response to an event.
Acknowledge the event immediately while reliably processing it in the background.

For example:

```golang
_, err := dbos.RunWorkflow(ctx, task, i, dbos.WithWorkflowID(exactlyOnceEventID))
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Durable Scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

####

Schedule workflows using cron syntax, or use durable sleep to pause workflows for as long as you like (even days or weeks) before executing.

```golang
dbos.RegisterWorkflow(dbosCtx, func(ctx dbos.DBOSContext, scheduledTime time.Time) (string, error) {
    return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Workflow executed at %s&quot;, scheduledTime), nil
}, dbos.WithSchedule(&quot;* * * * * *&quot;)) // Every second
```

You can add a durable sleep to any workflow with a single line of code.
It stores its wakeup time in Postgres so the workflow sleeps through any interruption or restart, then always resumes on schedule.

```golang
func workflow(ctx dbos.DBOSContext, duration time.Duration) (string, error) {
    dbos.Sleep(ctx, duration)
    return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Workflow slept for %s&quot;, duration), nil
}

handle, err := dbos.RunWorkflow(dbosCtx, workflow, time.Second*5)
_, err = handle.GetResult()
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📫 Durable Notifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

####

Pause your workflow executions until a notification is received, or emit events from your workflow to send progress updates to external clients.
All notifications are stored in Postgres, so they can be sent and received with exactly-once semantics.
Set durable timeouts when waiting for events, so you can wait for as long as you like (even days or weeks) through interruptions or restarts, then resume once a notification arrives or the timeout is reached.

For example, build a reliable billing workflow that durably waits for a notification from a payments service, processing it exactly-once:

```golang
func sendWorkflow(ctx dbos.DBOSContext, message string) (string, error) {
    err := dbos.Send(ctx, &quot;receiverID&quot;, message, &quot;topic&quot;)
    return &quot;sent&quot;, err
}

func receiveWorkflow(ctx dbos.DBOSContext, topic string) (string, error) {
    return dbos.Recv[string](ctx, topic, 48 * time.Hour)
}

// Start a receiver in the background
recvHandle, err := dbos.RunWorkflow(dbosCtx, receiveWorkflow, &quot;topic&quot;, dbos.WithWorkflowID(&quot;receiverID&quot;))

// Send a message
sendHandle, err := dbos.RunWorkflow(dbosCtx, sendWorkflow, &quot;hola!&quot;)
_, err = sendHandle.GetResult()

// Eventually get the response
recvResult, err := recvHandle.GetResult()
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## DBOS vs. Other Systems

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBOS vs. Temporal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

####

Both DBOS and Temporal provide durable execution, but DBOS is implemented in a lightweight Postgres-backed library whereas Temporal is implemented in an externally orchestrated server.

You can add DBOS to your program by installing this open-source library, connecting it to Postgres, and annotating workflows and steps.
By contrast, to add Temporal to your program, you must rearchitect your program to move your workflows and steps (activities) to a Temporal worker, configure a Temporal server to orchestrate those workflows, and access your workflows only through a Temporal client.
[This blog post](https://www.dbos.dev/blog/durable-execution-coding-comparison) makes the comparison in more detail.

**When to use DBOS:** You need to add durable workflows to your applications with minimal rearchitecting, or you are using Postgres.

**When to use Temporal:** You don&#039;t want to add Postgres to your stack, or you need a language DBOS doesn&#039;t support yet.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBOS vs. Airflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

####

DBOS and Airflow both provide workflow abstractions.
Airflow is targeted at data science use cases, providing many out-of-the-box connectors but requiring workflows be written as explicit DAGs and externally orchestrating them from an Airflow cluster.
Airflow is designed for batch operations and does not provide good performance for streaming or real-time use cases.
DBOS is general-purpose, but is often used for data pipelines, allowing developers to write workflows as code and requiring no infrastructure except Postgres.

**When to use DBOS:** You need the flexibility of writing workflows as code, or you need higher performance than Airflow is capable of (particularly for streaming or real-time use cases).

**When to use Airflow:** You need Airflow&#039;s ecosystem of connectors.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBOS vs. Celery/BullMQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

####

DBOS provides a similar queue abstraction to dedicated queueing systems like Celery or BullMQ: you can declare queues, submit tasks to them, and control their flow with concurrency limits, rate limits, timeouts, prioritization, etc.
However, DBOS queues are **durable and Postgres-backed** and integrate with durable workflows.
For example, in DBOS you can write a durable workflow that enqueues a thousand tasks and waits for their results.
DBOS checkpoints the workflow and each of its tasks in Postgres, guaranteeing that even if failures or interruptions occur, the tasks will complete and the workflow will collect their results.
By contrast, Celery/BullMQ are Redis-backed and don&#039;t provide workflows, so they provide fewer guarantees but better performance.

**When to use DBOS:** You need the reliability of enqueueing tasks from durable workflows.

**When to use Celery/BullMQ**: You don&#039;t need durability, or you need very high throughput beyond what your Postgres server can support.

![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true &quot;Docker Compose Logo&quot;)

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.

&gt; **Note**: About Docker Swarm
&gt; Docker Swarm used to rely on the legacy compose file format but did not adopted the compose specification
&gt; so is missing some of the recent enhancements in the compose syntax. After 
&gt; [acquisition by Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/software/swarm/) swarm isn&#039;t maintained by Docker Inc, and
&gt; as such some Docker Compose features aren&#039;t accessible to swarm users.

# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app&#039;s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `compose.yaml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - &quot;5000:5000&quot;
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```

[contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you find an issue, please report it on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).

Legacy
-------------

The Python version of Compose is available under the `v1` [branch](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1).
