Uncloud is a lightweight clustering and container orchestration tool that lets you deploy and manage web apps across
cloud VMs and bare metal with minimised cluster management overhead. It creates a secure WireGuard mesh network between
your Docker hosts and provides automatic service discovery, load balancing, ingress with HTTPS, and simple CLI commands
to manage your apps.

Unlike traditional orchestrators, there&#039;s no central control plane and quorum to maintain. Each machine maintains a
synchronised copy of the cluster state through peer-to-peer communication, keeping cluster operations functional even if
some machines go offline.

Uncloud is the solution for developers who want the flexibility of self-hosted infrastructure without the operational
complexity of Kubernetes.

## ✨ Features

* **Deploy anywhere**: Combine cloud VMs, dedicated servers, and bare metal into a unified computing environment,
  regardless of location or provider.
* **Docker Compose**: Familiar [Docker Compose](https://compose-spec.io/) format for defining services and volumes. No
  need to learn a new bespoke DSL.
* **Zero-downtime deployments**: Rolling updates without service interruption. Automatic rollback on failure is coming
  soon.
* **[Unregistry](https://github.com/psviderski/unregistry) integration**: Build and push your Docker images directly to
  your machines without an external registry. It will transfer only the missing layers, making it fast and efficient.
* **Service discovery**: Built-in DNS server resolves service names to container IPs.
* **Persistent storage**: Run stateful services with Docker volumes managed across machines.
* **Zero-config private network**: Automatic WireGuard mesh with peer discovery and NAT traversal. Containers get unique
  IPs for direct cross-machine communication.
* **No control plane**: Fully decentralised design eliminates single points of failure and reduces operational overhead.
* **Imperative over declarative**: Favoring imperative operations over state reconciliation simplifies both the mental
  model and troubleshooting.
* **Managed DNS**: Automatic DNS records `*.&lt;id&gt;.cluster.uncloud.run` for services with public access via managed
  [Uncloud DNS](https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud-dns) service.
* **Automatic HTTPS**: Built-in Caddy reverse proxy handles TLS certificate provisioning and renewal using Let&#039;s
  Encrypt.
* **Docker-like CLI**: Familiar commands for managing both infrastructure and applications.
* **Remote management**: Control your entire infrastructure through SSH access to any single machine in the cluster.

## 🎬 Quick demo

The screenshot below demonstrates how I use Uncloud to deploy https://uncloud.run website to 2 remote machines from
the [`compose.yaml`](website/compose.yaml) file on my local machine.

It exposes the container port `8000/tcp` as HTTPS on the domain `uncloud.run`, served by the Caddy reverse proxy on the
remote machines. All managed by Uncloud.

![Uncloud compose deployment demo](.github/images/compose-deploy.jpg)

Here is a more advanced use case. Deploy a highly available web app with automatic HTTPS across multiple regions and
on-premises in just a couple minutes.

## 💫 Why Uncloud?

Modern cloud platforms like Heroku and Render offer amazing developer experiences but at a premium price. Traditional
container orchestrators like Kubernetes provide power and flexibility but require significant operational expertise. I
believe there&#039;s a sweet spot in between — a pragmatic solution for the majority of us who aren&#039;t running at Google
scale. You should be able to:

* **Own your infrastructure and data**: Whether driven by costs, compliance, or flexibility, run applications on any
  combination of cloud VMs and personal hardware while controlling your data and maintaining the cloud-like experience
  you love.
* **Stay simple as you grow**: Start with a single machine and add more whenever you need without changing your
  workflow. No worrying about highly-available control planes or complex YAML configurations.
* **Build with proven primitives**: Get production-grade networking, deployment primitives, service discovery, load
  balancing, and ingress with HTTPS out of the box without becoming a distributed systems expert.
* **Support sustainable computing** 🌿: Minimise system overhead to maximise resources available for your applications.

Uncloud&#039;s goal is to make deployment and management of containerised applications feel as seamless as using a cloud
platform, whether you&#039;re running on a $5 VPS, a spare Mac mini, or a rack of bare metal servers.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Install Uncloud CLI:

   ```bash
   brew install psviderski/tap/uncloud

   # or using curl (macOS/Linux)
   curl -fsS https://get.uncloud.run/install.sh | sh
   ```

   See [Installation](https://uncloud.run/docs/getting-started/install-cli) for more options.

2. Initialise your first machine:

   ```bash
   uc machine init root@your-server-ip
   ```

3. Deploy your app from a Docker image and publish its container port 8000 as HTTPS using `app.example.com` domain:

   ```bash
   uc run -p app.example.com:8000/https image/my-app
   ```

4. Create a DNS A record in your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.) that points `app.example.com` to your
   server&#039;s IP address. Allow a few minutes for DNS propagation.

   That&#039;s it! Your app is now running and accessible at https://app.example.com ✨

5. Clean up when you&#039;re done:

   ```bash
   uc ls
   # Copy the service name from the output and run the rm command:
   uc rm my-app-name
   ```

   If you want to fully uninstall Uncloud on a machine, run:

   ```bash
   uncloud-uninstall
   ```

1. The CLI SSHs into the machine and installs Docker, the `uncloudd` machine daemon and
   [corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion) service, managed by systemd.
2. Generates a unique WireGuard key pair, allocates a dedicated subnet `10.210.0.0/24` for the machine and its
   containers, and configures `uncloudd` accordingly. All subsequent communication happens with `uncloudd`
   through its gRPC API over SSH.
3. Configures and starts `corrosion`, a CRDT-based distributed SQLite database to share cluster state between machines.
4. Creates a Docker bridge network connected to the WireGuard interface.
5. This machine becomes an entry point for the newly created cluster which is stored in the cluster config under
   `~/.config/uncloud` on your local machine.

```

1. The second machine gets provisioned just like the first. A non-root SSH user will need `sudo` access.
2. Allocates a new subnet `10.210.1.0/24` for the second machine and its containers.
3. Registers the second machine in the cluster state and exchanges WireGuard keys with the first machine.
4. Both machines establish a WireGuard tunnel between each other, allowing Docker containers connected to the bridge
   network to communicate directly across machines.
5. Configures and starts `corrosion` on the second machine to sync the cluster state.
6. The second machine is added as an alternative entry point in the cluster config.
7. If one of the machines goes offline, the other machine can still serve cluster operations.

If one more machine is added, the process repeats with a new subnet. The new machine needs to establish a WireGuard
connection with only one of the existing machines. Other machines will learn about it through the shared cluster state
and automatically establish a WireGuard tunnel with it.

**When you run a service:**

```bash
$ uc run -p app.example.com:8000/https image/my-app

[+] Running service my-app-1b3b (replicated mode) 1/1
 ✔ Container my-app-1b3b-tcex on oracle-vm  Started

my-app-1b3b endpoints:
 • https://app.example.com → :8000
 • https://my-app-1b3b.xuw3xd.cluster.uncloud.run → :8000
```

1. CLI picks a machine to run your container.
2. `uncloudd` that the CLI communicates with uses [`grpc-proxy`](https://github.com/siderolabs/grpc-proxy) to forward
   the request to the target machine to launch a container there.
3. `uncloudd` on the target machine starts the Docker container in the bridge network and stores its info in the
   cluster&#039;s distributed state.
4. The container gets a cluster-unique IP address from the bridge network (in the `10.210.X.2-254` range) and becomes
   accessible from other machines in the cluster.
5. Caddy reverse proxy which runs in [`global`](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/deploy.md#mode)
   mode on each machine watches the cluster state for new services and updates its configuration to route traffic to the
   new container.

Look ma, no control plane or master nodes to maintain! Just a simple overlay network and eventually consistent state
sync that lets machines work together. Want to check on things or make changes? Connect to any machine either implicitly
using the CLI or directly over SSH. They all have the complete cluster state and can control everything. It&#039;s like each
machine is a full backup of your control plane.
&lt;/details&gt;

## 🙏 Inspiration &amp; Acknowledgements

I&#039;m grateful to the following projects that inspired Uncloud&#039;s design and implementation:

* [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) — for proving that even in the declarative era of Kubernetes there is a place for
  simple deployment tools that use imperative commands without complex orchestration. Kamal powers the multi-billion
  dollar company [37signals](https://37signals.com/) where it was created, and that&#039;s truly inspiring!
* [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) — for inspiring my vision for what self-hosted infrastructure should feel like, proving that
  developer experience and powerful infrastructure can coexist beautifully.
* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) — for pioneering the vision of decentralised flat mesh networking with an amazing
  user experience that feels like magic.
* [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos)
  and [KubeSpan](https://www.talos.dev/v1.10/talos-guides/network/kubespan/) — for the machine API design using
  [grpc-proxy](https://github.com/siderolabs/grpc-proxy) and for its elegant approach to secure WireGuard-based overlay
  networking with zero configuration.
* [Docker Swarm Classic](https://github.com/docker-archive/classicswarm) and
  [Rancher 1.x](http://rancher-com-website-main-elb-elb-1798790864.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/)
  — for showing the power of simplicity and pragmatism in container orchestration and that not every problem needs the
  complexity of Kubernetes.

Special thanks to the [Corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion) project by Fly.io for providing the distributed
SQLite database used to share Uncloud&#039;s cluster state.

To use this, set this in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    &quot;typescript.experimental.useTsgo&quot;: true
}
```

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 5.9. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 5.9 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | done | Done, though `tsconfig` errors may not be as helpful. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 5.9. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 5.9. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | in progress | Mostly complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit not complete. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled. |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps. |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Most functionality. More features coming soon. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.9, see CHANGES.md.

# n.eko

Welcome to Neko, a self-hosted virtual browser that runs in Docker and uses WebRTC technology. Neko is a powerful tool that allows you to **run a fully-functional browser in a virtual environment**, giving you the ability to **access the internet securely and privately from anywhere**. With Neko, you can browse the web, **run applications**, and perform other tasks just as you would on a regular browser, all within a **secure and isolated environment**. Whether you are a developer looking to test web applications, a **privacy-conscious user seeking a secure browsing experience**, or simply someone who wants to take advantage of the **convenience and flexibility of a virtual browser**, Neko is the perfect solution.

In addition to its security and privacy features, Neko offers the **ability for multiple users to access it simultaneously**. This makes it an ideal solution for teams or organizations that need to share access to a browser, as well as for individuals who want to use **multiple devices to access the same virtual environment**. With Neko, you can **easily and securely share access to a browser with others**, without having to worry about maintaining separate configurations or settings. Whether you need to **collaborate on a project**, access shared resources, or simply want to **share access to a browser with friends or family**, Neko makes it easy to do so.

Neko is also a great tool for **hosting watch parties** and interactive presentations. With its virtual browser capabilities, Neko allows you to host watch parties and presentations that are **accessible from anywhere**, without the need for in-person gatherings. This makes it easy to **stay connected with friends and colleagues**, even when you are unable to meet in person. With Neko, you can easily host a watch party or give an **interactive presentation**, whether it&#039;s for leisure or work. Simply invite your guests to join the virtual environment, and you can share the screen and **interact with them in real-time**.

## About

This app uses WebRTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and he was able to figure out the rest.

Then I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore and it got eventually archived.

## Use-cases and comparison

Neko started as a virtual browser that is streamed using WebRTC to multiple users.
- It is **not only limited to a browser**; it can run anything that runs on linux (e.g. VLC). Browser only happens to be the most popular and widely used use-case.
- In fact, it is not limited to a single program either; you can install a full desktop environment (e.g. XFCE, KDE).
- Speaking of limits, it does not need to run in a container; you could install neko on your host, connect to your X server and control your whole VM.
- Theoretically it is not limited to only X server, anything that can be controlled and scraped periodically for images could be used instead.
  - Like implementing RDP or VNC protocol, where neko would only act as WebRTC relay server. This is currently only future.

Primary use case is connecting with multiple people, leveraging real time synchronization and interactivity:
- **Watch party** - watching video content together with multiple people and reacting to it (chat, emotes) - open source alternative to [giggl.app](https://giggl.app/) or [hyperbeam](https://watch.hyperbeam.com).
- **Interactive presentation** - not only screen sharing, but others can control the screen.
- **Collaborative tool** - brainstorming ideas, cobrowsing, code debugging together.
- **Support/Teaching** - interactively guiding people in controlled environment.
- **Embed anything** - embed virtual browser in your web app - open source alternative to [hyperbeam API](https://hyperbeam.com/).
  - open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants.
  - request rooms using API with [neko-rooms](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-rooms).

Other use cases that benefit from single-user:
- **Personal workspace** - streaming containerized apps and desktops to end-users - similar to [kasm](https://www.kasmweb.com/).
- **Persistent browser** - own browser with persistent cookies available anywhere - similar to [mightyapp](https://www.mightyapp.com/).
  - no state is left on the host browser after terminating the connection.
  - sensitive data like cookies are not transferred - only video is shared.
- **Throwaway browser** - a better solution for planning secret parties and buying birthday gifts off the internet.
  - use Tor Browser and [VPN](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-vpn) for additional anonymity.
  - mitigates risk of OS fingerprinting and browser vulnerabilities by running in container.
- **Session broadcasting** - broadcast room content using RTMP (to e.g. twitch or youtube...).
- **Session recording** - broadcast RTMP can be saved to a file using e.g. [nginx-rtmp](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/modules/rtmp-media-streaming/)
  - have clean environment when recording tutorials.
  - no need to hide bookmarks or use incognito mode.
- **Jump host** - access your internal applications securely without the need for VPN.
- **Automated browser** - you can install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and automate tasks while being able to actively intercept them.

Compared to clientless remote desktop gateway (e.g. [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) or [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) with [noVNC](https://novnc.com/)), installed with remote desktop server along with desired program (e.g. [linuxserver/firefox](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-firefox)) provides neko additionally:
- **Smooth video** because it uses WebRTC and not images sent over WebSockets.
- **Built in audio** support, what is not part of Apache Guacamole or noVNC.
- **Multi-participant control**, what is not natively supported by Apache Guacamole or noVNC.

### Why neko?

I like cats 🐱 (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I&#039;m a weeb/nerd.

***But why the cat butt?*** Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyways.

**Knowledge Base Management:** Support for creating FAQ and document knowledge base types, with multiple import methods including drag-and-drop, folder import, and URL import. Automatically identifies document structures and extracts core knowledge to establish indexes. Supports tag management and online entry. The system clearly displays processing progress and document status, achieving efficient knowledge base management.

**Agent Mode:** Support for ReACT Agent mode that can use built-in tools to retrieve knowledge bases, call user-configured MCP tools and web search tools to access external services, providing comprehensive summary reports through multiple iterations and reflection. Supports cross-knowledge base retrieval, allowing selection of multiple knowledge bases for simultaneous retrieval.

**Conversation Strategy:** Support for configuring Agent models, normal mode models, retrieval thresholds, and online Prompt configuration, with precise control over multi-turn conversation behavior and retrieval execution methods. The conversation input box supports Agent mode/normal mode switching, enabling/disabling web search, and selecting conversation models.

### Document Knowledge Graph

WeKnora supports transforming documents into knowledge graphs, displaying the relationships between different sections of the documents. Once the knowledge graph feature is enabled, the system analyzes and constructs an internal semantic association network that not only helps users understand document content but also provides structured support for indexing and retrieval, enhancing the relevance and breadth of search results.

For detailed configuration, please refer to the [Knowledge Graph Configuration Guide](./docs/KnowledgeGraph.md).

### MCP Server

Please refer to the [MCP Configuration Guide](./mcp-server/MCP_CONFIG.md) for the necessary setup.

## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don&#039;t need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Method 1: Using Make commands (Recommended)
make dev-start      # Start infrastructure
make dev-app        # Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend (new terminal)

# Method 2: One-click start
./scripts/quick-dev.sh

# Method 3: Using scripts
./scripts/dev.sh start     # Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev.sh app       # Start backend (new terminal)
./scripts/dev.sh frontend  # Start frontend (new terminal)
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging

# Quick Start #

## Quick Start for S3 API on Docker ##

`docker run -p 8333:8333 chrislusf/seaweedfs server -s3`

## Quick Start with Single Binary ##
* Download the latest binary from https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/releases and unzip a single binary file `weed` or `weed.exe`. Or run `go install github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed@latest`.
* `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin ; export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=key` as the admin credentials to access the object store.
* Run `weed server -dir=/some/data/dir -s3` to start one master, one volume server, one filer, and one S3 gateway.

Also, to increase capacity, just add more volume servers by running `weed volume -dir=&quot;/some/data/dir2&quot; -mserver=&quot;&lt;master_host&gt;:9333&quot; -port=8081` locally, or on a different machine, or on thousands of machines. That is it!

# Introduction #

SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

1. to store billions of files!
2. to serve the files fast!

SeaweedFS started as an Object Store to handle small files efficiently. 
Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, 
the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, 
and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. 
This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, 
allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation).

There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file&#039;s metadata. 
It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases.

SeaweedFS started by implementing [Facebook&#039;s Haystack design paper](http://www.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf). 
Also, SeaweedFS implements erasure coding with ideas from 
[f4: Facebook’s Warm BLOB Storage System](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-muralidhar.pdf), and has a lot of similarities with [Facebook’s Tectonic Filesystem](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast21-pan.pdf)

On top of the object store, optional [Filer] can support directories and POSIX attributes. 
Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, 
e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc.

For any distributed key value stores, the large values can be offloaded to SeaweedFS. 
With the fast access speed and linearly scalable capacity, 
SeaweedFS can work as a distributed [Key-Large-Value store][KeyLargeValueStore].

SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud. 
With hot data on local cluster, and warm data on the cloud with O(1) access time, 
SeaweedFS can achieve both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity.
What&#039;s more, the cloud storage access API cost is minimized. 
Faster and cheaper than direct cloud storage!

## Example: Using Seaweed Object Store ##

By default, the master node runs on port 9333, and the volume nodes run on port 8080.
Let&#039;s start one master node, and two volume nodes on port 8080 and 8081. Ideally, they should be started from different machines. We&#039;ll use localhost as an example.

SeaweedFS uses HTTP REST operations to read, write, and delete. The responses are in JSON or JSONP format.

### Start Master Server ###

```
&gt; ./weed master
```

### Start Volume Servers ###

```
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data1&quot; -max=5  -mserver=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8080 &amp;
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data2&quot; -max=10 -mserver=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8081 &amp;
```

### Write File ###

To upload a file: first, send a HTTP POST, PUT, or GET request to `/dir/assign` to get an `fid` and a volume server URL:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign
{&quot;count&quot;:1,&quot;fid&quot;:&quot;3,01637037d6&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;,&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}
```

Second, to store the file content, send a HTTP multi-part POST request to `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` from the response:

```
&gt; curl -F file=@/home/chris/myphoto.jpg http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;myphoto.jpg&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:43234,&quot;eTag&quot;:&quot;1cc0118e&quot;}
```

To update, send another POST request with updated file content.

For deletion, send an HTTP DELETE request to the same `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` URL:

```
&gt; curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
```

### Save File Id ###

Now, you can save the `fid`, 3,01637037d6 in this case, to a database field.

The number 3 at the start represents a volume id. After the comma, it&#039;s one file key, 01, and a file cookie, 637037d6.

The volume id is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The file key is an unsigned 64-bit integer. The file cookie is an unsigned 32-bit integer, used to prevent URL guessing.

The file key and file cookie are both coded in hex. You can store the &lt;volume id, file key, file cookie&gt; tuple in your own format, or simply store the `fid` as a string.

If stored as a string, in theory, you would need 8+1+16+8=33 bytes. A char(33) would be enough, if not more than enough, since most uses will not need 2^32 volumes.

If space is really a concern, you can store the file id in your own format. You would need one 4-byte integer for volume id, 8-byte long number for file key, and a 4-byte integer for the file cookie. So 16 bytes are more than enough.

### Read File ###

Here is an example of how to render the URL.

First look up the volume server&#039;s URLs by the file&#039;s volumeId:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/lookup?volumeId=3
{&quot;volumeId&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}]}
```

Since (usually) there are not too many volume servers, and volumes don&#039;t move often, you can cache the results most of the time. Depending on the replication type, one volume can have multiple replica locations. Just randomly pick one location to read.

Now you can take the public URL, render the URL or directly read from the volume server via URL:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
```

Notice we add a file extension &quot;.jpg&quot; here. It&#039;s optional and just one way for the client to specify the file content type.

If you want a nicer URL, you can use one of these alternative URL formats:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6/my_preferred_name.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6
```

If you want to get a scaled version of an image, you can add some params:

```
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fit
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fill
```

### Rack-Aware and Data Center-Aware Replication ###

SeaweedFS applies the replication strategy at a volume level. So, when you are getting a file id, you can specify the replication strategy. For example:

```
curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?replication=001
```

The replication parameter options are:

```
000: no replication
001: replicate once on the same rack
010: replicate once on a different rack, but same data center
100: replicate once on a different data center
200: replicate twice on two different data center
110: replicate once on a different rack, and once on a different data center
```

More details about replication can be found [on the wiki][Replication].

[Replication]: https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Replication

You can also set the default replication strategy when starting the master server.

### Allocate File Key on Specific Data Center ###

Volume servers can be started with a specific data center name:

```
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/1 -port=8080 -dataCenter=dc1
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/2 -port=8081 -dataCenter=dc2
```

When requesting a file key, an optional &quot;dataCenter&quot; parameter can limit the assigned volume to the specific data center. For example, this specifies that the assigned volume should be limited to &#039;dc1&#039;:

```
 http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?dataCenter=dc1
```

## Object Store Architecture ##

Usually distributed file systems split each file into chunks, a central master keeps a mapping of filenames, chunk indices to chunk handles, and also which chunks each chunk server has.

The main drawback is that the central master can&#039;t handle many small files efficiently, and since all read requests need to go through the chunk master, so it might not scale well for many concurrent users.

Instead of managing chunks, SeaweedFS manages data volumes in the master server. Each data volume is 32GB in size, and can hold a lot of files. And each storage node can have many data volumes. So the master node only needs to store the metadata about the volumes, which is a fairly small amount of data and is generally stable.

The actual file metadata is stored in each volume on volume servers. Since each volume server only manages metadata of files on its own disk, with only 16 bytes for each file, all file access can read file metadata just from memory and only needs one disk operation to actually read file data.

For comparison, consider that an xfs inode structure in Linux is 536 bytes.

### Master Server and Volume Server ###

The architecture is fairly simple. The actual data is stored in volumes on storage nodes. One volume server can have multiple volumes, and can both support read and write access with basic authentication.

All volumes are managed by a master server. The master server contains the volume id to volume server mapping. This is fairly static information, and can be easily cached.

On each write request, the master server also generates a file key, which is a growing 64-bit unsigned integer. Since write requests are not generally as frequent as read requests, one master server should be able to handle the concurrency well.

### Write and Read files ###

When a client sends a write request, the master server returns (volume id, file key, file cookie, volume node URL) for the file. The client then contacts the volume node and POSTs the file content.

When a client needs to read a file based on (volume id, file key, file cookie), it asks the master server by the volume id for t

Use OSV-Scanner to find existing vulnerabilities affecting your project&#039;s dependencies.
OSV-Scanner provides an officially supported frontend to the [OSV database](https://osv.dev/) and CLI interface to [OSV-Scalibr](https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr) that connects a project’s list of dependencies with the vulnerabilities that affect them.

OSV-Scanner supports a wide range of project types, package managers and features, including but not limited to:

- **Languages:** C/C++, Dart, Elixir, Go, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Rust.
- **Package Managers:** npm, pip, yarn, maven, go modules, cargo, gem, composer, nuget and others.
- **Operating Systems:** Detects vulnerabilities in OS packages on Linux systems.
- **Containers:** Scans container images for vulnerabilities in their base images and included packages.
- **Guided Remediation:** Provides recommendations for package version upgrades based on criteria such as dependency depth, minimum severity, fix strategy, and return on investment.

OSV-Scanner uses the extensible [OSV-Scalibr](https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr) library under the hood to provide this functionality. If a language or package manager is not supported currently, please file a [feature request.](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/issues)

#### Underlying database

The underlying database, [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) has several benefits in comparison with closed source advisory databases and scanners:

- Covering most open source language and OS ecosystems (including [Git](https://osv.dev/list?q=&amp;ecosystem=GIT)), it’s comprehensive.
- Each advisory comes from an open and authoritative source (e.g. [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/github/advisory-database), [RustSec Advisory Database](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db), [Ubuntu security notices](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/tree/main/osv))
- Anyone can suggest improvements to advisories, resulting in a very high quality database.
- The OSV format unambiguously stores information about affected versions in a machine-readable format that precisely maps onto a developer’s list of packages

The above all results in accurate and actionable vulnerability notifications, which reduces the time needed to resolve them. Check out [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) for more details!

## Basic installation

To install OSV-Scanner, please refer to the [installation section](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/installation) of our documentation. OSV-Scanner releases can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/releases) of the GitHub repository. The recommended method is to download a prebuilt binary for your platform. Alternatively, you can use
`go install github.com/google/osv-scanner/v2/cmd/osv-scanner@latest` to build it from source.

## Key Features

For more information, please read our [detailed documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner) to learn how to use OSV-Scanner. For detailed information about each feature, click their titles in this README.

Please note: These are the instructions for the latest OSV-Scanner V2 beta. If you are using V1, checkout the V1 [README](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner-v1) and [documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner-v1/) instead.

### [Scanning a source directory](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage)

```bash
$ osv-scanner scan source -r /path/to/your/dir
```

This command will recursively scan the specified directory for any supported package files, such as `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, etc. and output any discovered vulnerabilities.

OSV-Scanner has the option of using call analysis to determine if a vulnerable function is actually being used in the project, resulting in fewer false positives, and actionable alerts.

OSV-Scanner can also detect vendored C/C++ code for vulnerability scanning. See [here](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/#cc-scanning) for details.

#### Supported Lockfiles

OSV-Scanner supports 11+ language ecosystems and 19+ lockfile types. To check if your ecosystem is covered, please check out our [detailed documentation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/supported-languages-and-lockfiles/#supported-lockfiles).

### [Container Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/scan-image)

OSV-Scanner also supports comprehensive, layer-aware scanning for container images to detect vulnerabilities the following operating system packages and language-specific dependencies.

| Distro Support | Language Artifacts Support |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Alpine OS      | Go                         |
| Debian         | Java                       |

### [License Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/license-scanning/)

Check your dependencies&#039; licenses using deps.dev data. For a summary:

```bash
osv-scanner --licenses path/to/repository
```

To check against an allowed license list (SPDX format):

```bash
osv-scanner --licenses=&quot;MIT,Apache-2.0&quot; path/to/directory
```

### [Offline Scanning](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/offline-mode/)

Scan your project against a local OSV database. No network connection is required after the initial database download. The database can also be manually downloaded.

```bash
osv-scanner --offline --download-offline-databases ./path/to/your/dir
```

### [Guided Remediation](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/) (Experimental)

OSV-Scanner provides guided remediation, a feature that suggests package version upgrades based on criteria such as dependency depth, minimum severity, fix strategy, and return on investment.
We currently support remediating vulnerabilities in the following files:

| Ecosystem | File Format (Type)             | Supported Remediation Strategies                                                                                  |
| :-------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm       | `package-lock.json` (lockfile) | [`in-place`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#in-place-lockfile-remediation) |
| npm       | `package.json` (manifest)      | [`relock`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#in-place-lockfile-remediation)   |
| Maven     | `pom.xml` (manifest)           | [`override`](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/experimental/guided-remediation/#override-dependency-versions)  |

This is available as a headless CLI command, as well as an interactive mode.

#### Example (for npm)

```bash
$ osv-scanner fix \
    --max-depth=3 \
    --min-severity=5 \
    --ignore-dev  \
    --strategy=in-place \
    -L path/to/package-lock.json
```

#### Interactive mode (for npm)

```bash
$ osv-scanner fix \
    -M path/to/package.json \
    -L path/to/package-lock.json
```

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

CodeWeaver is a command-line tool that transforms your codebase into a single, navigable Markdown document. It recursively scans a directory, creating a tree-like representation of your project&#039;s file structure and embedding the content of each file within markdown code blocks.  This simplifies codebase sharing, documentation, and integration with AI/ML tools by providing a consolidated, readable Markdown output.

The output for the current repository can be found [here](https://github.com/tesserato/CodeWeaver/blob/main/codebase.md).

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Codebase Documentation:** Generates a Markdown file outlining your project&#039;s directory and file structure in a clear, tree-like format.
*   **Code Content Inclusion:** Embeds the *complete* content of each file within the Markdown document, using code blocks based on file extensions.
*   **Flexible Path Filtering:** Uses regular expressions to define `include` and / or `ignore` patterns, giving you precise control over which files are included.
*   **Optional Path Logging:**  Saves lists of included and excluded file paths to separate files for detailed tracking.
*   **Clipboard Integration:**  Optionally copies the generated Markdown to the clipboard for easy pasting.
*   **Simple CLI:** A straightforward command-line interface with intuitive options.

**Understanding `-include` and `-ignore`**

These flags control which files and directories are included in the generated documentation.

*   **`-ignore` (Blacklist):**  Excludes files/directories matching *any* of the provided regular expressions.
*   **`-include` (Whitelist):**  *Only* includes files/directories matching *at least one* of the provided regular expressions.  If `-include` is used, everything else is *excluded* by default.

**Behavior Table:**

| `-ignore` | `-include` | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :-------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No        | No         | Includes all files/directories except the input directory itself (`.`).                                                                                                        |
| Yes       | No         | Excludes files/directories matching `-ignore`; includes everything else.                                                                                                       |
| No        | Yes        | *Only* includes files/directories matching `-include`. Everything else is excluded.                                                                                            |
| Yes       | Yes        | Includes files/directories that match *at least one* `-include` pattern AND do *not* match *any* `-ignore` pattern.  `-include` creates a whitelist, and `-ignore` filters it. |

## Examples

**1. Basic Usage:**

```bash
codeweaver
```

Creates `codebase.md` in the current directory, documenting the structure and content (excluding paths matching the default ignore pattern `\.git.*`).

**2. Different Input/Output:**

```bash
codeweaver -input=my_project -output=project_docs.md
```

Processes `my_project` and saves the output to `project_docs.md`.

**3. Ignoring Files/Directories:**

```bash
codeweaver -ignore=&quot;\.log,temp,build&quot;
```

Excludes files/directories named `.log`, `temp`, or `build`.

**4. Including Only Specific Files:**

```bash
codeweaver -include=&quot;\.go$,\.md$&quot;
```

Includes *only* Go (`.go`) and Markdown (`.md`) files.

**5. Combining `include` and `ignore`:**

```bash
codeweaver -include=&quot;\.go$,\.md$&quot; -ignore=&quot;vendor,test&quot;
```

Includes Go and Markdown files, *except* those with &quot;vendor&quot; or &quot;test&quot; in their paths.

**6. Saving Included/Excluded Paths:**

```bash
codeweaver -ignore=&quot;node_modules&quot; -included-paths-file=included.txt -excluded-paths-file=excluded.txt
```

Creates `codebase.md`, saves included paths to `included.txt`, and excluded paths to `excluded.txt`.

**7. Copying to Clipboard:**

```bash
codeweaver -clipboard
```

Creates `codebase.md` and copies its content to the clipboard.

**8. Regex Examples:**

*   `.`: Matches any single character.
*   `*`: Matches zero or more of the preceding character.
*   `+`: Matches one or more of the preceding character.
*   `?`: Matches zero or one of the preceding character.
*   `[abc]`: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.
*   `[^abc]`: Matches any character *not* inside the brackets.
*   `[a-z]`: Matches any character in the range a-z.
*   `^`: Matches the beginning of the string.
*   `$`: Matches the end of the string.
*   `\.`: Matches a literal dot (.). You need to escape it because `.` has special meaning in regex.
*   `\|`: Used for alternation (OR).  e.g., `a\|b` matches either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;.
* `.*\.py[cod]$`: matches python files that end with pyc, pyd or pyo.
* `.*\.pdf`: matches PDF files.
* `(dir1\|dir2)`: matches `dir1` or `dir2`

**9. Complete example:**
```bash
codeweaver -input=. -output=codebase.md -ignore=&quot;\.git.*,.+\.exe,codebase.md,excluded_paths.txt&quot; -include=&quot;\.go$,\.md$,\.ps1$,\.yaml$,\.txt$,\.csv$&quot; -excluded-paths-file=&quot;excluded_paths.txt&quot; -clipboard
```
This command will:

* Process the current directory (`.`).
* Generate documentation and save it in `codebase.md`.
* Exclude files matching `.git.*`, `.+\.exe`, the output file (`codebase.md`), and the file where the excluded paths will be saved.
* Include *only* files with the extensions .go, .md, .ps1, .yaml, .txt, and .csv.
* Save the list of excluded files in a file named `excluded_paths.txt`.
* Copy the generated Markdown to the system clipboard.

----

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who&#039;s involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

----

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

## To start developing K8s

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```

For the full story, head over to the [developer&#039;s documentation].

## Support

If you need support, start with the [troubleshooting guide],
and work your way through the process that we&#039;ve outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us
[one way or another][communication].

## Community Meetings 

The [Calendar](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) has the list of all the meetings in the Kubernetes community in a single location.

## Adopters

The [User Case Studies](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/) website has real-world use cases of organizations across industries that are deploying/migrating to Kubernetes.

## Governance 

Kubernetes project is governed by a framework of principles, values, policies and processes to help our community and constituents towards our shared goals.

The [Kubernetes Community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) is the launching point for learning about how we organize ourselves.

The [Kubernetes Steering community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering) is used by the Kubernetes Steering Committee, which oversees governance of the Kubernetes project.

## Roadmap 

The [Kubernetes Enhancements repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) provides information about Kubernetes releases, as well as feature tracking and backlogs.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># OCI Image Format Specification

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/opencontainers/image-spec)
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/opencontainers/image-spec.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)

The OCI Image Format project creates and maintains the software shipping container image format spec (OCI Image Format).

**[The specification can be found here](spec.md).**

This repository also provides [Go types](specs-go), [intra-blob validation tooling, and JSON Schema](schema).
The Go types and validation should be compatible with the current Go release; earlier Go releases are not supported.

Additional documentation about how this group operates:

- [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]
- [Roadmap](#roadmap)
- [Releases](RELEASES.md)

## Running an OCI Image

The OCI Image Format partner project is the [OCI Runtime Spec project](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec).
The Runtime Specification outlines how to run a &quot;[filesystem bundle](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/bundle.md)&quot; that is unpacked on disk.
At a high-level an OCI implementation would download an OCI Image then unpack that image into an OCI Runtime filesystem bundle.
At this point the OCI Runtime Bundle would be run by an OCI Runtime.

This entire workflow supports the UX that users have come to expect from container engines like Docker and rkt: primarily, the ability to run an image with no additional arguments:

- docker run example.com/org/app:v1.0.0
- rkt run example.com/org/app,version=v1.0.0

To support this UX the OCI Image Format contains sufficient information to launch the application on the target platform (e.g. command, arguments, environment variables, etc).

## Distributing an OCI Image

The [OCI Distribution Spec Project](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/) defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content.
This API includes support for pushing and pulling OCI images to an OCI conformant registry.

## FAQ

**Q: What happens to AppC or Docker Image Formats?**

A: Existing formats can continue to be a proving ground for technologies, as needed.
The OCI Image Format project strives to provide a dependable open specification that can be shared between different tools and be evolved for years or decades of compatibility; as the deb and rpm format have.

Find more [FAQ on the OCI site](https://www.opencontainers.org/faq).

## Roadmap

The [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/milestones) lay out the path to the future improvements.

## Contributing

Development happens on GitHub for the spec.
Issues are used for bugs and actionable items and longer discussions can happen on the [mailing list](#mailing-list).

The specification and code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license found in the `LICENSE` file of this repository.

### Discuss your design

The project welcomes submissions, but please let everyone know what you are working on.

Before undertaking a nontrivial change to this specification, send mail to the [mailing list](#mailing-list) to discuss what you plan to do.
This gives everyone a chance to validate the design, helps prevent duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits.
It also guarantees that the design is sound before code is written; a GitHub pull-request is not the place for high-level discussions.

Typos and grammatical errors can go straight to a pull-request.
When in doubt, start on the [mailing-list](#mailing-list).

### Meetings

Please see the [OCI org repository README](https://github.com/opencontainers/org#meetings) for the most up-to-date information on OCI contributor and maintainer meeting schedules.
You can also find links to meeting agendas and minutes for all prior meetings.

### Mailing List

You can subscribe and join the mailing list on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!forum/dev).

### Markdown style

To keep consistency throughout the Markdown files in the Open Container spec all files should be formatted one sentence per line.
This fixes two things: it makes diffing easier with git and it resolves fights about line wrapping length.
For example, this paragraph will span three lines in the Markdown source.

### Git commit

#### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```text
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer&#039;s Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Joe Smith &lt;joe@gmail.com&gt;
```

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

You can add the sign off when creating the git commit via `git commit -s`.

### Commit Style

Simple house-keeping for clean git history.
Read more on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) or the Discussion section of [`git-commit(1)`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).

1. Separate the subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
   - If there was important/useful/essential conversation or information, copy or include a reference
8. When possible, one keyword to scope the change in the subject (i.e. &quot;README: ...&quot;, &quot;runtime: ...&quot;)

## Installation

### Recommended

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/grype | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```
Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of grype is community-maintained and not distributed by the anchore team.

```bash
choco install grype -y
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap anchore/grype
brew install grype
```

### MacPorts

On macOS, Grype can additionally be installed from the [community-maintained port](https://ports.macports.org/port/grype/) via MacPorts:

```bash
sudo port install grype
```

**Note**: Currently, Grype is built only for macOS and Linux.

### From source

See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md#native-development) for instructions to build and run from source.

### GitHub Actions

If you&#039;re using GitHub Actions, you can use our [Grype-based action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/anchore-container-scan) to run vulnerability scans on your code or container images during your CI workflows.

## Verifying the artifacts

Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.

You need the following tool to verify signature:

- [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)

Verification steps are as follow:

1. Download the files you want, and the checksums.txt, checksums.txt.pem and checksums.txt.sig files from the [releases](https://github.com/anchore/grype/releases) page:

2. Verify the signature:

```shell
cosign verify-blob &lt;path to checksum.txt&gt; \
--certificate &lt;path to checksums.txt.pem&gt; \
--signature &lt;path to checksums.txt.sig&gt; \
--certificate-identity-regexp &#039;https://github\.com/anchore/grype/\.github/workflows/.+&#039; \
--certificate-oidc-issuer &quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot;
```

3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:

```shell
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt
```

## Getting started

[Install the binary](#installation), and make sure that `grype` is available in your path. To scan for vulnerabilities in an image:

```
grype &lt;image&gt;
```

The above command scans for vulnerabilities visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the vulnerability scan, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```
grype &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

To run grype from a Docker container so it can scan a running container, use the following command:

```yml
docker run --rm \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
--name Grype anchore/grype:latest \
$(ImageName):$(ImageTag)
```

## Supported sources

Grype can scan a variety of sources beyond those found in Docker.

```
# scan a container image archive (from the result of `docker image save ...`, `podman save ...`, or `skopeo copy` commands)
grype path/to/image.tar

# scan a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container
grype path/to/image.sif

# scan a directory
grype dir:path/to/dir
```

Sources can be explicitly provided with a scheme:

```
podman:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Podman daemon
docker:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Docker daemon
docker-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar   use a tarball from disk for archives created from &quot;docker save&quot;
oci-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar      use a tarball from disk for OCI archives (from Skopeo or otherwise)
oci-dir:path/to/yourimage              read directly from a path on disk for OCI layout directories (from Skopeo or otherwise)
singularity:path/to/yourimage.sif      read directly from a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container on disk
dir:path/to/yourproject                read directly from a path on disk (any directory)
file:path/to/yourfile                  read directly from a file on disk
sbom:path/to/syft.json                 read Syft JSON from path on disk
registry:yourrepo/yourimage:tag        pull image directly from a registry (no container runtime required)
```

If an image source is not provided and cannot be detected from the given reference it is assumed the image should be pulled from the Docker daemon.
If docker is not present, then the Podman daemon is attempted next, followed by reaching out directly to the image registry last.


This default behavior can be overridden with the `default-image-pull-source` configuration option (See [Configuration](https://github.com/anchore/grype#configuration) for more details).

Use SBOMs for even faster vulnerability scanning in Grype:

```
# Then scan for new vulnerabilities as frequently as needed
grype sbom:./sbom.json

# (You can also pipe the SBOM into Grype)
cat ./sbom.json | grype
```

Grype supports input of [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)
SBOM formats. If Syft has generated any of these file types, they should have the appropriate information to work properly with Grype.
It is also possible to use SBOMs generated by other tools with varying degrees of success. Two things that make Grype matching
more successful are the inclusion of CPE and Linux distribution information. If an SBOM does not include any CPE information, it
is possible to generate these based on package information using the `--add-cpes-if-none` flag. To specify a distribution,
use the `--distro &lt;distro&gt;:&lt;version&gt;` flag. A full example is:

```
grype --add-cpes-if-none --distro alpine:3.10 sbom:some-alpine-3.10.spdx.json
```

## Threat &amp; Risk Prioritization

This section explains the columns and UI cues that help prioritize remediation efforts:

- **Severity**: String-based severity derived from CVSS scores that indicates the significance of a vulnerability in levels.
  This balances concerns such as ease of exploitability, and the potential to affect
  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of software and services.

- **EPSS**:
  [Exploit Prediction Scoring System](https://www.first.org/epss/model) is a metric expressing the likelihood
  that a vulnerability will be 
  exploited in the wild over the next 30 days (on a 0–1 scale); higher values signal a greater likelihood of 
  exploitation.
  The table output shows the EPSS percentile, a one-way transform of the EPSS score showing the 
  proportion of all scored vulnerabilities with an equal or lower probability.
  Percentiles linearize a heavily skewed distribution, making threshold choice (e.g. “only CVEs above the 
  90th percentile”) straightforward.

- **KEV Indicator**: Flags entries from CISA’s [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
  --an authoritative list of flaws observed being exploited in the wild.

- **Risk Score**: A composite 0–100 metric calculated as:
  ```markdown
  risk = min(1, threat * average(severity)) * 100
  ```
  Where: 
  - `severity` is the average of all CVSS scores and string severity for a vulnerability (scaled between 0–1).
  - `threat` is the EPSS score (between 0–1). If the vulnerability is on the KEV list then `threat` is 
    `1.05`, or `1.1` if the vulnerability is associated with a ransomware campaign.
  This metric is one way to combine EPSS and CVSS suggested in the [EPSS user guide](https://www.first.org/epss/user-guide).

- **Suggested Fixes**: All possible fixes for a package are listed, however, when multiple fixes are available, we de-emphasize all 
  upgrade paths except for the minimal upgrade path (which highlights the smallest, safest version bump).

Results default to sorting by Risk Score and can be overridden with `--sort-by &lt;value&gt;`:

- `severity`: sort by severity
- `epss`: sort by EPSS percentile (aka, &quot;threat&quot;)
- `risk`: sort by risk score
- `kev`: just like risk, except that KEV entries are always above non-KEV entries
- `package`: sort by package name, version, type
- `vulnerability`: sort by vulnerability ID

### Supported versions

Software updates are always applied to the latest version of Grype; fixes are not backported to any previous versions of Grype.

In terms of database updates, any version of Grype before v0.51.0 (Oct 2022, before schema v5) will not receive
vulnerability database updates. You can still build vulnerability databases for unsupported Grype releases by using previous
releases of [vunnel](https://github.com/anchore/vunnel) to gather the upstream data and [grype-db](https://github.com/anchore/grype-db)
to build databases for unsupported schemas.

Only the latest database schema is considered to be supported. When a new database schema is introduced then the one it replaces is
marked as deprecated. Deprecated schemas will continue to receive updates for at least one year after they are marked
as deprecated at which point they will no longer be supported.

### Working with attestations
Grype supports scanning SBOMs as input via stdin. Users can use [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to verify attestations
with an SBOM as its content to scan an image for vulnerabilities:
```
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-attestation caphill4/java-spdx-tools:latest \
| jq -r .payload \
| base64 --decode \
| jq -r .predicate.Data \
| grype
```

### Vulnerability Summary

#### Basic Grype Vulnerability Data Shape

```json
 {
  &quot;vulnerability&quot;: {
    ...
  },
  &quot;relatedVulnerabilities&quot;: [
    ...
  ],
  &quot;matchDetails&quot;: [
    ...
  ],
  &quot;artifact&quot;: {
    ...
  }
}
```

- **Vulnerability**: All information on the specific vulnerability that was directly matched on (e.g. ID, severity, CVSS score, fix information, links for more information)
- **RelatedVulnerabilities**: Information pertaining to vulnerabilities found to be related to the main reported vulnerability. Perhaps the vulnerability we matched on was a GitHub Security Advisory, which has an upstream CVE (in the authoritative national vulnerability database). In these cases we list the upstream vulnerabilities here.
- **MatchDetails**: This section tries to explain what we searched for while looking for a match and exactly what details on the package and vulnerability that led to a match.
- **Artifact**: This is a subset of the information that we know about the package (when compared to the [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) json output, we summarize the metadata section).
  This has information about where within the container image or directory we found the package, what kind of package it is, licensing info, pURLs, CPEs, etc.

### Excluding file paths

Grype can exclude files and paths from being scanned within a source by using glob expressions
with one or more `--exclude` parameters:

```
grype &lt;source&gt; --exclude &#039;./out/**/*.json&#039; --exclude /etc
```

**Note:** in the case of _image scanning_, since the entire filesystem is scanned it is
possible to use absolute paths like `/etc` or `/usr/**/*.txt` whereas _directory scans_
exclude files _relative to the specified directory_. For example: scanning `/usr/foo` with
`--exclude ./package.json` would exclude `/usr/foo/package.json` and `--exclude &#039;**/package.json&#039;`
would exclude all `package.json` files under `/usr/foo`. For _directory scans_,
it is required to begin path expressions with `./`, `*/`, or `**/`, all of which
will be resolved _relative to the specified scan directory_. Keep in mind, your shell
may attempt to expand wildcards, so put those parameters in single quotes, like:
`&#039;**/*.json&#039;`.

### External Sources

Grype can be configured to incorporate external data sources for added fidelity in vulnerability matching. This
feature is currently disabled by default. To enable this feature add the following to the grype config:

```yaml
external-sources:
  enable: true
  maven:
    search-upstream-by-sha1: true
    base-url: https://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select
    rate-limit: 300ms # Time between Maven API requests
```

You can also configure the base-url if you&#039;re using another registry as your maven endpoint.

The rate at which Maven API requests are made can be configured to match your environment&#039;s requirements. The default is 300ms between requests.

### Output formats

The output format for Grype is configurable as well:

```
grype &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;
```

Where the formats available are:

- `table`: A columnar summary (default).
- `cyclonedx`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.6 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).
- `json`: Use this to get as much information out of Grype as possible!
- `sarif`: Use this option to get a [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) report (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)
- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [&quot;Using templates&quot;](#using-templates) below.

### Using templates

Grype lets you define custom output formats, using [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). Here&#039;s how it works:

- Define your format as a Go template, and save this template as a file.

- Set the output format to &quot;template&quot; (`-o template`).

- Specify the path to the template file (`-t ./path/to/custom.template`).

- Grype&#039;s template processing uses the same data models as the `json` output format — so if you&#039;re wondering what data is available as you author a template, you can use the output from `grype &lt;image&gt; -o json` as a reference.

**Please note:** Templates can access information about the system they are running on, such as environment variables. You should never run untrusted templates.

There are several example templates in the [templates](https://github.com/anchore/grype/tree/main/templates) directory in the Grype source which can serve as a starting point for a custom output format. For example, [csv.tmpl](https://github.com/anchore/grype/blob/main/templates/csv.tmpl) produces a vulnerability report in CSV (comma separated value) format:

```text
&quot;Package&quot;,&quot;Version Installed&quot;,&quot;Vulnerability ID&quot;,&quot;Severity&quot;
&quot;coreutils&quot;,&quot;8.30-3ubuntu2&quot;,&quot;CVE-2016-2781&quot;,&quot;Low&quot;
&quot;libc-bin&quot;,&quot;2.31-0ubuntu9&quot;,&quot;CVE-2016-10228&quot;,&quot;Negligible&quot;
&quot;libc-bin&quot;,&quot;2.31-0ubuntu9&quot;,&quot;CVE-2020-6096&quot;,&quot;Low&quot;
...
```

You can also find the template for the default &quot;table&quot; output format in the same place.

Grype also includes a vast array of utility templating functions from [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) apart from the default golang [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Functions) to allow users to customize the output from Grype.

### Gating on severity of vulnerabilities

You can have Grype exit with an error if any vulnerabilities are reported at or above the specified severity level. This comes in handy when using Grype within a script or CI pipeline. To do this, use the `--fail-on &lt;severity&gt;` CLI flag.

For example, here&#039;s how you could trigger a CI pipeline failure if any vulnerabilities are found in the `ubuntu:latest` image with a severity of &quot;medium&quot; or higher:

```
grype ubuntu:latest --fail-on medium
```

**Note:** Grype returns exit code `2` on vulnerability errors.

### Specifying matches to ignore

If you&#039;re seeing Grype report **false positives** or any other vulnerability matches that you just don&#039;t want to see, you can tell Grype to **ignore** matches by specifying one or more _&quot;ignore rules&quot;_ in your Grype configuration file (e.g. `~/.grype.yaml`). This causes Grype not to report any vulnerability matches that meet the criteria specified by any of your ignore rules.

Each rule can specify any combination of the following criteria:

- vulnerability ID (e.g. `&quot;CVE-2008-4318&quot;`)
- include vulnerability aliases when matching on a vulnerability ID (set `&quot;include-aliases&quot;` to `true`)
- namespace (e.g. `&quot;nvd&quot;`)
- fix state (allowed valu

Lazyssh is a terminal-based, interactive SSH manager inspired by tools like lazydocker and k9s — but built for managing your fleet of servers directly from your terminal.
&lt;br/&gt;
With lazyssh, you can quickly navigate, connect, manage, and transfer files between your local machine and any server defined in your `~/.ssh/config`. No more remembering IP addresses or running long scp commands — just a clean, keyboard-driven UI.

---

## 🔐 Security Notice

lazyssh does not introduce any new security risks.
It is simply a UI/TUI wrapper around your existing `~/.ssh/config` file.

- All SSH connections are executed through your system’s native ssh binary (OpenSSH).

- Private keys, passwords, and credentials are never stored, transmitted, or modified by lazyssh.

- Your existing IdentityFile paths and ssh-agent integrations work exactly as before.

- lazyssh only reads and updates your `~/.ssh/config`. A backup of the file is created automatically before any changes.

- File permissions on your SSH config are preserved to ensure security.


## 🛡️ Config Safety: Non‑destructive writes and backups

- Non‑destructive edits: lazyssh only writes the minimal required changes to your ~/.ssh/config. It uses a parser that preserves existing comments, spacing, order, and any settings it didn’t touch. Your handcrafted comments and formatting remain intact.
- Atomic writes: updates are written to a temporary file and then atomically renamed over the original, minimizing the risk of partial writes.
- Backups:
  - One‑time original backup: before lazyssh makes its first change, it creates a single snapshot named config.original.backup beside your SSH config. If this file is present, it will never be recreated or overwritten.
  - Rolling backups: on every subsequent save, lazyssh also creates a timestamped backup named like: ~/.ssh/config-&lt;timestamp&gt;-lazyssh.backup. The app keeps at most 10 of these backups, automatically removing the oldest ones.

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

# MinIO Quickstart Guide

[![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/minio/minio.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20V3-blue)](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE)

[![MinIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/.github/logo.svg?sanitize=true)](https://min.io)

MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage solution released under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license.
Designed for speed and scalability, it powers AI/ML, analytics, and data-intensive workloads with industry-leading performance.

- S3 API Compatible – Seamless integration with existing S3 tools
- Built for AI &amp; Analytics – Optimized for large-scale data pipelines
- High Performance – Ideal for demanding storage workloads.

This README provides instructions for building MinIO from source and deploying onto baremetal hardware.
Use the [MinIO Documentation](https://github.com/minio/docs) project to build and host a local copy of the documentation.

## MinIO is Open Source Software

We designed MinIO as Open Source software for the Open Source software community. We encourage the community to remix, redesign, and reshare MinIO under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

All usage of MinIO in your application stack requires validation against AGPLv3 obligations, which include but are not limited to the release of modified code to the community from which you have benefited. Any commercial/proprietary usage of the AGPLv3 software, including repackaging or reselling services/features, is done at your own risk.

The AGPLv3 provides no obligation by any party to support, maintain, or warranty the original or any modified work.
All support is provided on a best-effort basis through Github and our [Slack](https//slack.min.io) channel, and any member of the community is welcome to contribute and assist others in their usage of the software.

MinIO [AIStor](https://www.min.io/product/aistor) includes enterprise-grade support and licensing for workloads which require commercial or proprietary usage and production-level SLA/SLO-backed support. For more information, [reach out for a quote](https://min.io/pricing).

## Source-Only Distribution

**Important:** The MinIO community edition is now distributed as source code only. We will no longer provide pre-compiled binary releases for the community version.

### Installing Latest MinIO Community Edition

To use MinIO community edition, you have two options:

1. **Install from source** using `go install github.com/minio/minio@latest` (recommended)
2. **Build a Docker image** from the provided Dockerfile

See the sections below for detailed instructions on each method.

### Legacy Binary Releases

Historical pre-compiled binary releases remain available for reference but are no longer maintained:
- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/minio/minio/releases
- Direct downloads: https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/

**These legacy binaries will not receive updates.** We strongly recommend using source builds for access to the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates.

## Install from Source

Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source.
If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow [How to install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install). Minimum version required is [go1.24](https://golang.org/dl/#stable)

```sh
go install github.com/minio/minio@latest
```

You can alternatively run `go build` and use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to control the OS and architecture target.
For example:

```
env GOOS=linux GOARCh=arm64 go build
```

Start MinIO by running `minio server PATH` where `PATH` is any empty folder on your local filesystem.

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`.
You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server.
Point a web browser running on the host machine to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; and log in with the root credentials.
You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client `mc` commandline tool:

```sh
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc admin info local
```

See [Test using MinIO Client `mc`](#test-using-minio-client-mc) for more information on using the `mc` commandline tool.
For application developers, see &lt;https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/developers/sdk/&gt; to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Production environments using compiled-from-source MinIO binaries do so at their own risk.
&gt; The AGPLv3 license provides no warranties nor liabilites for any such usage.

## Build Docker Image

You can use the `docker build .` command to build a Docker image on your local host machine.
You must first [build MinIO](#install-from-source) and ensure the `minio` binary exists in the project root.

The following command builds the Docker image using the default `Dockerfile` in the root project directory with the repository and image tag `myminio:minio`

```sh
docker build -t myminio:minio .
```

Use `docker image ls` to confirm the image exists in your local repository.
You can run the server using standard Docker invocation:

```sh
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 myminio:minio server /tmp/minio --console-address :9001
```

Complete documentation for building Docker containers, managing custom images, or loading images into orchestration platforms is out of scope for this documentation.
You can modify the `Dockerfile` and `dockerscripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` as-needed to reflect your specific image requirements.

See the [MinIO Container](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/baremetal-deploy-minio-as-a-container.html#deploy-minio-container) documentation for more guidance on running MinIO within a Container image.

## Install using Helm Charts

There are two paths for installing MinIO onto Kubernetes infrastructure:

- Use the [MinIO Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator)
- Use the community-maintained [Helm charts](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/helm/minio)

See the [MinIO Documentation](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/kubernetes.html) for guidance on deploying using the Operator.
The Community Helm chart has instructions in the folder-level README.

## Test MinIO Connectivity

### Test using MinIO Console

MinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser.
Point your web browser to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:9000&gt; to ensure your server has started successfully.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use `--console-address` to pick a specific interface and port.

### Test using MinIO Client `mc`

`mc` provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services.

The following commands set a local alias, validate the server information, create a bucket, copy data to that bucket, and list the contents of the bucket.

```sh
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc admin info
mc mb data
mc cp ~/Downloads/mydata data/
mc ls data/
```

Follow the MinIO Client [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart) for further instructions.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># 🤖 `cagent` 🤖

&gt; A powerful, easy-to-use, customizable multi-agent runtime that orchestrates AI
&gt; agents with specialized capabilities and tools, and the interactions between
&gt; agents.

![cagent in action](docs/demo.gif)

## ✨ What is `cagent`? ✨

`cagent` lets you create and run intelligent AI agents, where each agent has
specialized knowledge, tools and capabilities.

Think of it as allowing you to quickly build, share and run a team of virtual
experts that collaborate to solve complex problems for you.

And it&#039;s dead easy to use!

⚠️ Note: `cagent` is in active development, **breaking changes are to be
expected** ⚠️

### Your First Agent

Example [basic_agent.yaml](/examples/basic_agent.yaml):

Creating agents with cagent is straightforward. They are described in a short .yaml
file, like this one:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-5-mini
    description: A helpful AI assistant
    instruction: |
      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.
      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses.
```

Run it in a terminal with `cagent run basic_agent.yaml`.

Many more examples can be found [here](/examples/README.md)!

### Improving an agent with MCP tools

`cagent` supports MCP servers, enabling agents to use a wide variety of external
tools and services.

It supports three transport types: `stdio`, `http` and `sse`.

Giving an agent access to tools via MCP is a quick way to greatly improve its
capabilities, the quality of its results and its general usefulness.

Get started quickly with the [Docker MCP
Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/) and
[catalog](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/catalog/)

Here, we&#039;re giving the same basic agent from the example above access to a
**containerized** `duckduckgo` mcp server and its tools by using Docker&#039;s MCP
Gateway:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-5-mini
    description: A helpful AI assistant
    instruction: |
      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.
      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses.
    toolsets:
      - type: mcp
        ref: docker:duckduckgo # stdio transport
```

When using a containerized server via the Docker MCP gateway, you can configure
any required settings/secrets/authentication using the [Docker MCP
Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/#example-use-the-github-official-mcp-server)
in Docker Desktop.

Aside from the containerized MCP servers the Docker MCP Gateway provides, any
standard MCP server can be used with cagent!

Here&#039;s an example similar to the above but adding `read_file` and `write_file`
tools from the `rust-mcp-filesystem` MCP server:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-5-mini
    description: A helpful AI assistant
    instruction: |
      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.
      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses. Write your search results to disk.
    toolsets:
      - type: mcp
        ref: docker:duckduckgo
      - type: mcp
        command: rust-mcp-filesystem # installed with `cargo install rust-mcp-filesystem`
        args: [&quot;--allow-write&quot;, &quot;.&quot;]
        tools: [&quot;read_file&quot;, &quot;write_file&quot;] # Optional: specific tools only
        env:
          - &quot;RUST_LOG=debug&quot;
```

See [the USAGE docs](./docs/USAGE.md#tool-configuration) for more detailed
information and examples

### Exposing agents as MCP tools

`cagent` can expose agents as MCP tools via the `cagent mcp` command, allowing other MCP clients to use your agents.

Each agent in your configuration becomes an MCP tool with its description.

```bash
# Start MCP server with local file
cagent mcp ./examples/dev-team.yaml

# Or use an OCI artifact
cagent mcp agentcatalog/pirate
```

This exposes each agent as a tool (e.g., `root`, `designer`, `awesome_engineer`) that MCP clients can call:

```json
{
  &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;,
  &quot;params&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;designer&quot;,
    &quot;arguments&quot;: {
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Design a login page&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

See [MCP Mode documentation](./docs/MCP-MODE.md) for detailed instructions on exposing your agents through MCP with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and other MCP clients.

## 🚀 Quick Start 🚀

### Installation

#### Using Homebrew

Install `cagent` with a single command using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)!

```sh
$ brew install cagent
```

#### Using binary releases

[Prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/docker/cagent/releases) for Windows,
macOS and Linux can be found on the release page of the [project&#039;s GitHub
repository](https://github.com/docker/cagent/releases)

Once you&#039;ve downloaded the appropriate binary for your platform, you may need to
give it executable permissions. On macOS and Linux, this is done with the
following command:

```sh
# linux amd64 build example
chmod +x /path/to/downloads/cagent-linux-amd64
```

You can then rename the binary to `cagent` and configure your `PATH` to be able
to find it (configuration varies by platform).

### **Set your API keys**

Based on the models you configure your agents to use, you will need to set the
corresponding provider API key accordingly, all these keys are optional, you
will likely need at least one of these, though:

```bash
# For OpenAI models
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For Anthropic models
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For Gemini models
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For xAI models
export XAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For Nebius models
export NEBIUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For Mistral models
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Run Agents!

```bash
# Run an agent!
cagent run ./examples/pirate.yaml

# or specify a different starting agent from the config, useful for agent teams
cagent run ./examples/pirate.yaml -a root

# or run directly from an image reference here I&#039;m pulling the pirate agent from the creek repository
cagent run creek/pirate
```

### Multi-agent team example

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: claude
    description: &quot;Main coordinator agent that delegates tasks and manages workflow&quot;
    instruction: |
      You are the root coordinator agent. Your job is to:
      1. Understand user requests and break them down into manageable tasks
      2. Delegate appropriate tasks to your helper agent
      3. Coordinate responses and ensure tasks are completed properly
      4. Provide final responses to the user
      When you receive a request, analyze what needs to be done and decide whether to:
      - Handle it yourself if it&#039;s simple
      - Delegate to the helper agent if it requires specific assistance
      - Break complex requests into multiple sub-tasks
    sub_agents: [&quot;helper&quot;]

  helper:
    model: claude
    description: &quot;Assistant agent that helps with various tasks as directed by the root agent&quot;
    instruction: |
      You are a helpful assistant agent. Your role is to:
      1. Complete specific tasks assigned by the root agent
      2. Provide detailed and accurate responses
      3. Ask for clarification if tasks are unclear
      4. Report back to the root agent with your results

      Focus on being thorough and helpful in whatever task you&#039;re given.

models:
  claude:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-0
    max_tokens: 64000
```

You&#039;ll find a curated list of agents examples, spread into 3 categories,
[Basic](https://github.com/docker/cagent/tree/main/examples#basic-configurations),
[Advanced](https://github.com/docker/cagent/tree/main/examples#advanced-configurations)
and
[multi-agents](https://github.com/docker/cagent/tree/main/examples#multi-agent-configurations)
in the `/examples/` directory.

### DMR (Docker Model Runner) provider options

When using the `dmr` provider, you can use the `provider_opts` key for DMR
runtime-specific (e.g. llama.cpp/vllm) options and speculative decoding:

```yaml
models:
  local-qwen:
    provider: dmr
    model: ai/qwen3
    max_tokens: 8192
    provider_opts:
      # general flags passed to the underlying model runtime
      runtime_flags: [&quot;--ngl=33&quot;, &quot;--repeat-penalty=1.2&quot;, ...] # or comma/space-separated string
      # speculative decoding for faster inference
      speculative_draft_model: ai/qwen3:1B
      speculative_num_tokens: 5
      speculative_acceptance_rate: 0.8
```

The default base_url `cagent` will use for DMR providers is
`http://localhost:12434/engines/llama.cpp/v1`. DMR itself might need to be
enabled via [Docker Desktop&#039;s
settings](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/get-started/#enable-dmr-in-docker-desktop)
on macOS and Windows, and via the command-line on [Docker CE on
Linux](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/get-started/#enable-dmr-in-docker-engine).

See the [DMR Provider documentation](docs/USAGE.md#dmr-docker-model-runner-provider-usage) for more details on runtime flags and speculative decoding options.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Give your agents access to your documents with cagent&#039;s modular RAG system. It supports multiple retrieval strategies that can be used individually or combined for hybrid search.

### Quick RAG Example

```yaml
models:
  embedder:
    provider: openai
    model: text-embedding-3-small

rag:
  my_knowledge_base:
    docs: [./documents, ./pdfs]
    strategies:
      - type: chunked-embeddings
        model: embedder
        threshold: 0.5
        chunking:
          size: 1000
          overlap: 100
    results:
      limit: 5

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: |
      You are an assistant with access to an internal knowledge base.
      Use the knowledge base to gather context before answering user questions
    rag: [my_knowledge_base]
```

### Hybrid Retrieval (Chunked-Embeddings + BM25)

Combine semantic search (chunked-embeddings) with keyword search (BM25) for best results:

```yaml
rag:
  hybrid_search:
    docs: [./shared_docs]
    
    strategies:
      - type: chunked-embeddings
        model: embedder
        threshold: 0.5
        limit: 20
        chunking:
          size: 1000
          overlap: 100
      
      - type: bm25
        k1: 1.5
        b: 0.75
        threshold: 0.3
        limit: 15
        chunking:
          size: 1000
          overlap: 100
    
    results:
      fusion:
        strategy: rrf  # Reciprocal Rank Fusion
        k: 60
      deduplicate: true
      limit: 5

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    rag: [hybrid_search]
```

**Features:**
- **Multiple strategies**: Vector embeddings, semantic embeddings, BM25 (keyword), or combinations
- **Parallel execution**: Strategies run concurrently for fast results
- **Pluggable fusion**: RRF, weighted, or max score combining
- **Result reranking**: Re-score results with specialized models for improved relevance
- **Per-strategy configuration**: Different thresholds, limits, and documents
- **Auto file watching**: Reindex automatically on file changes

### Result Reranking

Improve search quality by re-scoring retrieved results with a reranking model:

```yaml
rag:
  knowledge_base:
    docs: [./documents]
    strategies:
      - type: chunked-embeddings
        model: openai/text-embedding-3-small
        limit: 20  # Retrieve more candidates for reranking
    
    results:
      reranking:
        model: openai/gpt-4.1-mini   # Any chat model or DMR reranker
        top_k: 10                   # Only rerank top 10 (optional)
        threshold: 0.3              # Filter low-scoring results (optional)
        criteria: |                 # Domain-specific relevance guidance (optional, not used with DMR reranking specific models)
          Prioritize recent documentation and practical examples.
          Documents from official sources are more relevant.
      limit: 5  # Final top results after reranking
```

**Supported providers:** DMR (native `/rerank` endpoint), OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini (via structured outputs)  
**Note:** Temperature defaults to 0.0 for more deterministic scoring when not explicitly set.

See the [RAG documentation in USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md#rag-configuration) for complete details, examples, and debugging guides.

## Quickly generate agents and agent teams with `cagent new`

Using the command `cagent new` you can quickly generate agents or multi-agent
teams using a single prompt!  
`cagent` has a built-in agent dedicated to this task.

To use the feature, you must have an Anthropic, OpenAI or Google API key
available in your environment or specify a local model to run with DMR (Docker
Model Runner).

You can choose what provider and model gets used by passing the `--model
provider/modelname` flag to `cagent new`

If `--model` is unspecified, `cagent new` will automatically choose between
these three providers in order based on the first api key it finds in your
environment.

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # first choice. default model claude-sonnet-4-0
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here     # if anthropic key not set. default model gpt-5-mini
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here     # if anthropic and openai keys are not set. default model gemini-2.5-flash
```

`--max-tokens` can be specified to override the context limit used.  
When using DMR, the default is 16k to limit memory usage. With all other
providers the default is 64k

`--max-iterations` can be specified to override how many times the agent is
allowed to loop when doing tool calling etc. When using DMR, the default is set
to 20 (small local models have the highest chance of getting confused and
looping endlessly). For all other providers, the default is 0 (unlimited).

Example of provider, model, context size and max iterations overriding:

```sh
# Use GPT-5 via OpenAI
cagent new --model openai/gpt-5

# Use a local model (ai/gemma3-qat:12B) via DMR
cagent new --model dmr/ai/gemma3-qat:12B

# Override the max_tokens used during generation, default is 64k, 16k when using the dmr provider
cagent new --model openai/gpt-5-mini --max-tokens 32000

# Override max_iterations to limit how much the model can loop autonomously when tool calling
cagent new --model dmr/ai/gemma3n:2B-F16 --max-iterations 15
```

---

```
$ cagent new

------- Welcome to cagent! -------
(Ctrl+C to stop the agent and exit)

What should your agent/agent team do? (describe its purpose):

&gt; I need an agent team that connects to &lt;some-service&gt; and does...
```

## Pushing and pulling agents from Docker Hub

### `cagent push`

Agent configurations can be packaged and shared to Docker Hub using the `cagent
push` command

```sh
cagent push ./&lt;agent-file&gt;.yaml namespace/reponame
```

`cagent` will automatically build an OCI image and push it to the desired
repository using your Docker credentials

### `cagent pull`

Pulling agents from Docker Hub is also just one `cagent pull` command away.

```sh
cagent pull creek/pirate
```

`cagent` will pull the image, extract the .yaml file and place it in your working
directory for ease of use.

`cagent run creek.yaml` will run your newly pulled agent

## Usage

More details on the usage and configuration of `cagent` can be found in
[USAGE.md](/docs/USAGE.md)

## Telemetry

We track anonymous usage data to improve the tool. See
[TELEMETRY.md](/docs/TELEMETRY.md) for details.

## Contributing

Want to hack on `cagent`, or help us fix bugs and build out some features? 🔧

Read the information on how to build from source and contribute to the project
in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## DogFooding: using `cagent` to code on `cagent`

A smart way to improve `cagent`&#039;s codebase and feature set is to do it with the
help of a `cagent` agent!

We have one that we use and that you should use too:

```sh
cd cagent
cagent run ./golang_developer.yaml
```

This agent is an _expert Golang developer specializing in the cagent multi-agent
AI system architecture_.

Ask it anything about `cagent`. It can be questions about the current code or
about improvements to the code. It can also fix issues and implement new
features!

nix run github:numtide/nix-ai-tools#crush
```

Windows users:

```bash
# Winget
winget install charmbracelet.crush

# Scoop
scoop bucket add charm https://github.com/charmbracelet/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install crush
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nix (NUR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Crush is available via [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) in `nur.repos.charmbracelet.crush`.

You can also try out Crush via `nix-shell`:

```bash
# Add the NUR channel.
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/main.tar.gz nur
nix-channel --update

# Get Crush in a Nix shell.
nix-shell -p &#039;(import &lt;nur&gt; { pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}; }).repos.charmbracelet.crush&#039;
```

### NixOS &amp; Home Manager Module Usage via NUR

Crush provides NixOS and Home Manager modules via NUR.
You can use these modules directly in your flake by importing them from NUR. Since it auto detects whether its a home manager or nixos context you can use the import the exact same way :)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nur.url = &quot;github:nix-community/NUR&quot;;
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nur, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
      modules = [
        nur.modules.nixos.default
        nur.repos.charmbracelet.modules.crush
        {
          programs.crush = {
            enable = true;
            settings = {
              providers = {
                openai = {
                  id = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  name = &quot;OpenAI&quot;;
                  base_url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1&quot;;
                  type = &quot;openai&quot;;
                  api_key = &quot;sk-fake123456789abcdef...&quot;;
                  models = [
                    {
                      id = &quot;gpt-4&quot;;
                      name = &quot;GPT-4&quot;;
                    }
                  ];
                };
              };
              lsp = {
                go = { command = &quot;gopls&quot;; enabled = true; };
                nix = { command = &quot;nil&quot;; enabled = true; };
              };
              options = {
                context_paths = [ &quot;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&quot; ];
                tui = { compact_mode = true; };
                debug = false;
              };
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, or OpenRouter and just start
Crush. You&#039;ll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

| Environment Variable        | Provider                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`         | Anthropic                                          |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`            | OpenAI                                             |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`        | OpenRouter                                         |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`            | Google Gemini                                      |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`          | Cerebras                                           |
| `HF_TOKEN`                  | Huggingface Inference                              |
| `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`          | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `VERTEXAI_LOCATION`         | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`              | Groq                                               |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`         | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`     | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_REGION`                | Amazon Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_PROFILE`               | Amazon Bedrock (Custom Profile)                       |
| `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`  | Amazon Bedrock                                        |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI models                                |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`      | Azure OpenAI models (optional when using Entra ID) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`  | Azure OpenAI models                                |

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Catwalk Badge&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  &quot;this-setting&quot;: { &quot;this&quot;: &quot;that&quot; },
  &quot;that-setting&quot;: [&quot;ceci&quot;, &quot;cela&quot;]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;lsp&quot;: {
    &quot;go&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gopls&quot;,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;GOTOOLCHAIN&quot;: &quot;go1.24.5&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;typescript&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;typescript-language-server&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;--stdio&quot;]
    },
    &quot;nix&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nil&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/mcp-server.js&quot;],
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NODE_ENV&quot;: &quot;production&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;github&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer $GH_PAT&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;streaming-service&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/mcp/sse&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 120,
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;API-Key&quot;: &quot;$(echo $API_KEY)&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don&#039;t want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you&#039;d like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;permissions&quot;: {
    &quot;allowed_tools&quot;: [
      &quot;view&quot;,
      &quot;ls&quot;,
      &quot;grep&quot;,
      &quot;edit&quot;,
      &quot;mcp_context7_get-library-doc&quot;
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Initialization

When you initialize a project, Crush analyzes your codebase and creates
a context file that helps it work more effectively in future sessions.
By default, this file is named `AGENTS.md`, but you can customize the
name and location with the `initialize_as` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;initialize_as&quot;: &quot;AGENTS.md&quot;
  }
}
```

This is useful if you prefer a different naming convention or want to
place the file in a specific directory (e.g., `CRUSH.md` or
`docs/LLMs.md`). Crush will fill the file with project-specific context
like build commands, code patterns, and conventions it discovered during
initialization.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;attribution&quot;: {
      &quot;trailer_style&quot;: &quot;co-authored-by&quot;,
      &quot;generated_with&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

- `trailer_style`: Controls the attribution trailer added to commit messages
  (default: `assisted-by`)
	- `assisted-by`: Adds `Assisted-by: [Model Name] via Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	  (includes the model name)
	- `co-authored-by`: Adds `Co-Authored-By: Crush &lt;crush@charm.land&gt;`
	- `none`: No attribution trailer
- `generated_with`: When true (default), adds `💘 Generated with Crush` line to
  commit messages and PR descriptions

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Note that we support two &quot;types&quot; for OpenAI. Make sure to choose the right one
&gt; to ensure the best experience!
&gt; * `openai` should be used when proxying or routing requests through OpenAI.
&gt; * `openai-compat` should be used when using non-OpenAI providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don&#039;t forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;deepseek&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Deepseek V3&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 0.27,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 0.07,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 1.1,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 64000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;custom-anthropic&quot;: {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anthropic&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.anthropic.com/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&quot;,
      &quot;extra_headers&quot;: {
        &quot;anthropic-version&quot;: &quot;2023-06-01&quot;
      },
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Claude Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`
- Alternatively to `aws configure`, you can also just set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;vertexai&quot;: {
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;claude-sonnet-4@20250514&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VertexAI Sonnet 4&quot;,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in&quot;: 3,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out&quot;: 15,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_in_cached&quot;: 3.75,
          &quot;cost_per_1m_out_cached&quot;: 0.3,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 200000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 50000,
          &quot;can_reason&quot;: true,
          &quot;supports_attachments&quot;: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;ollama&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ollama&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen3:30b&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  &quot;providers&quot;: {
    &quot;lmstudio&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;LM Studio&quot;,
      &quot;base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:1234/v1/&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;openai-compat&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Qwen 3 30B&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507&quot;,
          &quot;context_window&quot;: 256000,
          &quot;default_max_tokens&quot;: 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;debug&quot;: true,
    &quot;debug_lsp&quot;: true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://charm.land/crush.json&quot;,
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_provider_auto_update&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
crush update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
crush update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at crush at build time.
crush update-providers embedded

# For more info:
crush update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Crush records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code ([here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/blob/main/internal/llm/agent/event.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Or by setting the following in your config:

```json
{
  &quot;options&quot;: {
    &quot;disable_metrics&quot;: true
  }
}
```

Crush also respects the [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://consoledonottrack.com)
convention which can be enabled via `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

etcd is used [in production by many companies](./ADOPTERS.md), and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as [Kubernetes][k8s], [locksmith][], [vulcand][], [Doorman][], and many others. Reliability is further ensured by rigorous [**robustness testing**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness).

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.

## Maintainers

[Maintainers](OWNERS) strive to shape an inclusive open source project culture where users are heard and contributors feel respected and empowered. Maintainers aim to build productive relationships across different companies and disciplines. Read more about [Maintainers role and responsibilities](Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md#maintainers).

## Getting started

### Getting etcd

The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker on the [release page][github-release].

For more installation guides, please check out [play.etcd.io](http://play.etcd.io) and [operating etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide).

[github-release]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases

### Running etcd

First start a single-member cluster of etcd.

If etcd is installed using the [pre-built release binaries][github-release], run it from the installation location as below:

```bash
/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd
```

The etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:

```bash
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/
etcd
```

This will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.

Next, let&#039;s set a single key, and then retrieve it:

```bash
etcdctl put mykey &quot;this is awesome&quot;
etcdctl get mykey
```

etcd is now running and serving client requests. For more, please check out:

* [Interactive etcd playground](http://play.etcd.io)
* [Animated quick demo](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/demo)

### etcd TCP ports

The [official etcd ports][iana-ports] are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.

[iana-ports]: http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

### Running a local etcd cluster

First install [goreman](https://github.com/mattn/goreman), which manages Procfile-based applications.

Our [Procfile script](./Procfile) will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:

```bash
goreman start
```

This will bring up 3 etcd members `infra1`, `infra2` and `infra3` and optionally etcd `grpc-proxy`, which runs locally and composes a cluster.

Every cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.

Follow the comments in [Procfile script](./Procfile) to add a learner node to the cluster.

### Install etcd client v3

```bash
go get go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3
```

### Next steps

Now it&#039;s time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.

* Read the full [documentation].
* Review etcd [frequently asked questions].
* Explore the full gRPC [API].
* Set up a [multi-machine cluster][clustering].
* Learn the [config format, env variables and flags][configuration].
* Find [language bindings and tools][integrations].
* Use TLS to [secure an etcd cluster][security].
* [Tune etcd][tuning].

### Community meetings

etcd contributors and maintainers meet every week at `11:00` AM (USA Pacific) on Thursday and meetings alternate between community meetings and issue triage meetings. Meeting agendas are recorded in a [shared Google doc][shared-meeting-notes] and everyone is welcome to suggest additional topics or other agendas.

Issue triage meetings are aimed at getting through our backlog of PRs and Issues. Triage meetings are open to any contributor; you don&#039;t have to be a reviewer or approver to help out! They can also be a good way to get started contributing.

The meeting lead role is rotated for each meeting between etcd maintainers or sig-etcd leads and is recorded in a [shared Google sheet][shared-rotation-sheet].

Meeting recordings are uploaded to the official etcd [YouTube channel].

### Server SDKs

Server SDKs enable your backend to generate [access tokens](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/),
call [server APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/server/server-apis/), and
receive [webhooks](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/webhooks/). In addition, the Go SDK includes client capabilities,
enabling you to build automations that behave like end-users.

### Tools

-   [CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) - command line interface &amp; load tester
-   [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/livekit/livekit-server)
-   [Helm charts](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-helm)

## Install

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend installing [LiveKit CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) along with the server. It lets you access
&gt; server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic.

The following will install LiveKit&#039;s media server:

### MacOS

```shell
brew install livekit
```

### Linux

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io | bash
```

### Windows

Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases/latest)

## Getting Started

### Starting LiveKit

Start LiveKit in development mode by running `livekit-server --dev`. It&#039;ll use a placeholder API key/secret pair.

```
API Key: devkey
API Secret: secret
```

To customize your setup for production, refer to our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/)

### Creating access token

A user connecting to a LiveKit room requires an [access token](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/#creating-a-token). Access
tokens (JWT) encode the user&#039;s identity and the room permissions they&#039;ve been granted. You can generate a token with our
CLI:

```shell
lk token create \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --join --room my-first-room --identity user1 \
    --valid-for 24h
```

### Test with example app

Head over to our [example app](https://example.livekit.io) and enter a generated token to connect to your LiveKit
server. This app is built with our [React SDK](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-react).

Once connected, your video and audio are now being published to your new LiveKit instance!

### Simulating a test publisher

```shell
lk room join \
    --url ws://localhost:7880 \
    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
    --identity bot-user1 \
    --publish-demo \
    my-first-room
```

This command publishes a looped demo video to a room. Due to how the video clip was encoded (keyframes every 3s),
there&#039;s a slight delay before the browser has sufficient data to begin rendering frames. This is an artifact of the
simulation.

## Deployment

### Use LiveKit Cloud

LiveKit Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run LiveKit. Every project gets free monthly bandwidth and
transcoding credits.

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

### Self-host

Read our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/) for more information.

## Building from source

Pre-requisites:

-   Go 1.23+ is installed
-   GOPATH/bin is in your PATH

Then run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/livekit/livekit
cd livekit
./bootstrap.sh
mage
```
