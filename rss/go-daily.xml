## 🔧 Initialization Configuration Guide

To help users quickly configure various models and reduce trial-and-error costs, we&#039;ve improved the original configuration file initialization method by adding a Web UI interface for model configuration. Before using, please ensure the code is updated to the latest version. The specific steps are as follows:
If this is your first time using this project, you can skip steps ①② and go directly to steps ③④.

### ① Stop the services

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh --stop
```

### ② Clear existing data tables (recommended when no important data exists)

```bash
make clean-db
```

### ③ Compile and start services

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh
```

### ④ Access Web UI

http://localhost

On your first visit, you will be automatically redirected to the registration/login page. After completing registration, please create a new knowledge base and finish the relevant settings on its configuration page.

## 📱 Interface Showcase

### Web UI Interface

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knowledge Base Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/knowledgebases.png&quot; alt=&quot;Knowledge Base Management&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conversation Settings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/settings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Conversation Settings&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agent Mode Tool Call Process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/agent-qa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Agent Mode Tool Call Process&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

**Knowledge Base Management:** Support for creating FAQ and document knowledge base types, with multiple import methods including drag-and-drop, folder import, and URL import. Automatically identifies document structures and extracts core knowledge to establish indexes. Supports tag management and online entry. The system clearly displays processing progress and document status, achieving efficient knowledge base management.

**Agent Mode:** Support for ReACT Agent mode that can use built-in tools to retrieve knowledge bases, call user-configured MCP tools and web search tools to access external services, providing comprehensive summary reports through multiple iterations and reflection. Supports cross-knowledge base retrieval, allowing selection of multiple knowledge bases for simultaneous retrieval.

**Conversation Strategy:** Support for configuring Agent models, normal mode models, retrieval thresholds, and online Prompt configuration, with precise control over multi-turn conversation behavior and retrieval execution methods. The conversation input box supports Agent mode/normal mode switching, enabling/disabling web search, and selecting conversation models.

### Document Knowledge Graph

WeKnora supports transforming documents into knowledge graphs, displaying the relationships between different sections of the documents. Once the knowledge graph feature is enabled, the system analyzes and constructs an internal semantic association network that not only helps users understand document content but also provides structured support for indexing and retrieval, enhancing the relevance and breadth of search results.

For detailed configuration, please refer to the [Knowledge Graph Configuration Guide](./docs/KnowledgeGraph.md).

### MCP Server

Please refer to the [MCP Configuration Guide](./mcp-server/MCP_CONFIG.md) for the necessary setup.

## 📘 API Reference

Detailed API documentation is available at: [API Docs](./docs/api/README.md)

## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don&#039;t need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Method 1: Using Make commands (Recommended)
make dev-start      # Start infrastructure
make dev-app        # Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend (new terminal)

# Method 2: One-click start
./scripts/quick-dev.sh

# Method 3: Using scripts
./scripts/dev.sh start     # Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev.sh app       # Start backend (new terminal)
./scripts/dev.sh frontend  # Start frontend (new terminal)
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging

**Detailed Documentation:** [Development Environment Quick Start](./docs/开发指南.md)

# What is TruffleHog 🐽

TruffleHog is the most powerful secrets **Discovery, Classification, Validation,** and **Analysis** tool. In this context, secret refers to a credential a machine uses to authenticate itself to another machine. This includes API keys, database passwords, private encryption keys, and more.

## Discovery 🔍

TruffleHog can look for secrets in many places including Git, chats, wikis, logs, API testing platforms, object stores, filesystems and more.

## Classification 📁

TruffleHog classifies over 800 secret types, mapping them back to the specific identity they belong to. Is it an AWS secret? Stripe secret? Cloudflare secret? Postgres password? SSL Private key? Sometimes it&#039;s hard to tell looking at it, so TruffleHog classifies everything it finds.

## Validation ✅

For every secret TruffleHog can classify, it can also log in to confirm if that secret is live or not. This step is critical to know if there’s an active present danger or not.

## Analysis 🔬

For the 20 some of the most commonly leaked out credential types, instead of sending one request to check if the secret can log in, TruffleHog can send many requests to learn everything there is to know about the secret. Who created it? What resources can it access? What permissions does it have on those resources?

```

### Compile from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog.git
cd trufflehog; go install
```

### Using installation script

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Using installation script, verify checksum signature (requires cosign to be installed)

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -v -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Using installation script to install a specific version

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin &lt;ReleaseTag like v3.56.0&gt;
```

# :closed_lock_with_key: Verifying the artifacts

Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.

You need the following tool to verify signature:

- [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)

Verification steps are as follows:

1. Download the artifact files you want, and the following files from the [releases](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/releases) page.

   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt
   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt.pem
   - trufflehog\_{version}\_checksums.txt.sig

2. Verify the signature:

   ```shell
   cosign verify-blob &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt&gt; \
   --certificate &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.pem&gt; \
   --signature &lt;path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.sig&gt; \
   --certificate-identity-regexp &#039;https://github\.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/\.github/workflows/.+&#039; \
   --certificate-oidc-issuer &quot;https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com&quot;
   ```

3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:

   ```shell
   sha256sum --ignore-missing -c trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt
   ```

Replace `{version}` with the downloaded files version

Alternatively, if you are using the installation script, pass `-v` option to perform signature verification.
This requires Cosign binary to be installed prior to running the installation script.

...
```

## 4: Scan a GitHub Repo + its Issues and Pull Requests

```bash
trufflehog github --repo=https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys --issue-comments --pr-comments
```

## 5: Scan an S3 bucket for high-confidence results (verified + unknown)

```bash
trufflehog s3 --bucket=&lt;bucket name&gt; --results=verified,unknown
```

## 6: Scan S3 buckets using IAM Roles

```bash
trufflehog s3 --role-arn=&lt;iam role arn&gt;
```

## 7: Scan a Github Repo using SSH authentication in Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -v &quot;$HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro&quot; trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest git ssh://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys
```

## 8: Scan individual files or directories

```bash
trufflehog filesystem path/to/file1.txt path/to/file2.txt path/to/dir
```

## 9: Scan a local git repo

Clone the git repo. For example [test keys](git@github.com:trufflesecurity/test_keys.git) repo.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:trufflesecurity/test_keys.git
```

Run trufflehog from the parent directory (outside the git repo).
```bash
$ trufflehog git file://test_keys --results=verified,unknown
```

To guard against malicious git configs in local scanning (see CVE-2025-41390), TruffleHog clones local git repositories to a temporary directory prior to scanning. This follows [Git&#039;s security best practices](https://git-scm.com/docs/git#_security). If you want to specify a custom path to clone the repository to (instead of tmp), you can use the `--clone-path` flag. If you&#039;d like to skip the local cloning process and scan the repository directly (only do this for trusted repos), you can use the `--trust-local-git-config` flag.

## 10: Scan GCS buckets for only verified secrets

```bash
trufflehog gcs --project-id=&lt;project-ID&gt; --cloud-environment --results=verified
```

## 11: Scan a Docker image for only verified secrets

Use the `--image` flag multiple times to scan multiple images.

```bash
# to scan from a remote registry
trufflehog docker --image trufflesecurity/secrets --results=verified

# to scan from the local docker daemon
trufflehog docker --image docker://new_image:tag --results=verified

# to scan from an image saved as a tarball
trufflehog docker --image file://path_to_image.tar --results=verified
```

## 12: Scan in CI

Set the `--since-commit` flag to your default branch that people merge into (ex: &quot;main&quot;). Set the `--branch` flag to your PR&#039;s branch name (ex: &quot;feature-1&quot;). Depending on the CI/CD platform you use, this value can be pulled in dynamically (ex: [CIRCLE_BRANCH in Circle CI](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/) and [TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH in Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/)). If the repo is cloned and the target branch is already checked out during the CI/CD workflow, then `--branch HEAD` should be sufficient. The `--fail` flag will return an 183 error code if valid credentials are found.

```bash
trufflehog git file://. --since-commit main --branch feature-1 --results=verified,unknown --fail
```

## 13: Scan a Postman workspace

Use the `--workspace-id`, `--collection-id`, `--environment` flags multiple times to scan multiple targets.

```bash
trufflehog postman --token=&lt;postman api token&gt; --workspace-id=&lt;workspace id&gt;
```

## 14: Scan a Jenkins server

```bash
trufflehog jenkins --url https://jenkins.example.com --username admin --password admin
```

## 15: Scan an Elasticsearch server

### Scan a Local Cluster

There are two ways to authenticate to a local cluster with TruffleHog: (1) username and password, (2) service token.

#### Connect to a local cluster with username and password

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --username truffle --password hog
```

#### Connect to a local cluster with a service token

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --service-token ‘AAEWVaWM...Rva2VuaSDZ’
```

### Scan an Elastic Cloud Cluster

To scan a cluster on Elastic Cloud, you’ll need a Cloud ID and API key.

```bash
trufflehog elasticsearch \
  --cloud-id &#039;search-prod:dXMtY2Vx...YjM1ODNlOWFiZGRlNjI0NA==&#039; \
  --api-key &#039;MlVtVjBZ...ZSYlduYnF1djh3NG5FQQ==&#039;
```

## 16. Scan a GitHub Repository for Cross Fork Object References and Deleted Commits

The following command will enumerate deleted and hidden commits on a GitHub repository and then scan them for secrets. This is an alpha release feature.

```bash
trufflehog github-experimental --repo https://github.com/&lt;USER&gt;/&lt;REPO&gt;.git --object-discovery
```

In addition to the normal TruffleHog output, the `--object-discovery` flag creates two files in a new `$HOME/.trufflehog` directory: `valid_hidden.txt` and `invalid.txt`. These are used to track state during commit enumeration, as well as to provide users with a complete list of all hidden and deleted commits (`valid_hidden.txt`). If you&#039;d like to automatically remove these files after scanning, please add the flag `--delete-cached-data`.

**Note**: Enumerating all valid commits on a repository using this method takes between 20 minutes and a few hours, depending on the size of your repository. We added a progress bar to keep you updated on how long the enumeration will take. The actual secret scanning runs extremely fast.

For more information on Cross Fork Object References, please [read our blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github).

## 17. Scan Hugging Face

### Scan a Hugging Face Model, Dataset or Space

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --model &lt;model_id&gt; --space &lt;space_id&gt; --dataset &lt;dataset_id&gt;
```

### Scan all Models, Datasets and Spaces belonging to a Hugging Face Organization or User

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --org &lt;orgname&gt; --user &lt;username&gt;
```

(Optionally) When scanning an organization or user, you can skip an entire class of resources with `--skip-models`, `--skip-datasets`, `--skip-spaces` OR a particular resource with `--ignore-models &lt;model_id&gt;`, `--ignore-datasets &lt;dataset_id&gt;`, `--ignore-spaces &lt;space_id&gt;`.

### Scan Discussion and PR Comments

```bash
trufflehog huggingface --model &lt;model_id&gt; --include-discussions --include-prs
```

## 18. Scan stdin Input

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://example/gzipped/data.gz - | gunzip -c | trufflehog stdin
```

# :question: FAQ

- All I see is `🐷🔑🐷  TruffleHog. Unearth your secrets. 🐷🔑🐷` and the program exits, what gives?
  - That means no secrets were detected
- Why is the scan taking a long time when I scan a GitHub org
  - Unauthenticated GitHub scans have rate limits. To improve your rate limits, include the `--token` flag with a personal access token
- It says a private key was verified, what does that mean?
  - A verified result means TruffleHog confirmed the credential is valid by testing it against the service&#039;s API. For private keys, we&#039;ve confirmed the key can be used live for SSH or SSL authentication. Check out our Driftwood blog post to learn more [Blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood-know-if-private-keys-are-sensitive/)
- Is there an easy way to ignore specific secrets?
  - If the scanned source [supports line numbers](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/d6375ba92172fd830abb4247cca15e3176448c5d/pkg/engine/engine.go#L358-L365), then you can add a `trufflehog:ignore` comment on the line containing the secret to ignore that secrets.

# :newspaper: What&#039;s new in v3?

TruffleHog v3 is a complete rewrite in Go with many new powerful features.

- We&#039;ve **added over 700 credential detectors that support active verification against their respective APIs**.
- We&#039;ve also added native **support for scanning GitHub, GitLab, Docker, filesystems, S3, GCS, Circle CI and Travis CI**.
- **Instantly verify private keys** against millions of github users and **billions** of TLS certificates using our [Driftwood](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood) technology.
- Scan binaries, documents, and other file formats
- Available as a GitHub Action and a pre-commit hook

## What is credential verification?

For every potential credential that is detected, we&#039;ve painstakingly implemented programmatic verification against the API that we think it belongs to. Verification eliminates false positives and provides three result statuses:

- **verified**: Credential confirmed as valid and active by API testing
- **unverified**: Credential detected but not confirmed valid (may be invalid, expired, or verification disabled)  
- **unknown**: Verification attempted but failed due to errors, such as a network or API failure

For example, the [AWS credential detector](pkg/detectors/aws/aws.go) performs a `GetCallerIdentity` API call against the AWS API to verify if an AWS credential is active.

# :memo: Usage

TruffleHog has a sub-command for each source of data that you may want to scan:

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

Marking the PR with the `ready to merge` label should only happen (by triagers/approvers/maintainers)
once there is at least one approval from an approver, as per the description above.

# Quick Start #


## Quick Start with weed mini ##
The easiest way to get started with SeaweedFS for development and testing:

* Download the latest binary from https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/releases and unzip a single binary file `weed` or `weed.exe`.

Example:

```bash
# remove quarantine on macOS
# xattr -d com.apple.quarantine  ./weed

./weed mini -dir=/data
```

This single command starts a complete SeaweedFS setup with:
- **Master UI**: http://localhost:9333
- **Volume Server**: http://localhost:9340
- **Filer UI**: http://localhost:8888
- **S3 Endpoint**: http://localhost:8333
- **WebDAV**: http://localhost:7333
- **Admin UI**: http://localhost:23646

Perfect for development, testing, learning SeaweedFS, and single node deployments!

## Quick Start for S3 API on Docker ##

`docker run -p 8333:8333 chrislusf/seaweedfs server -s3`

## Quick Start with Single Binary ##
* Download the latest binary from https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/releases and unzip a single binary file `weed` or `weed.exe`. Or run `go install github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed@latest`.
* `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin ; export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=key` as the admin credentials to access the object store.
* Run `weed server -dir=/some/data/dir -s3` to start one master, one volume server, one filer, and one S3 gateway. The difference with `weed mini` is that `weed mini` can auto configure based on the single host environment, while `weed server` requires manual configuration and are designed for production use.

Also, to increase capacity, just add more volume servers by running `weed volume -dir=&quot;/some/data/dir2&quot; -master=&quot;&lt;master_host&gt;:9333&quot; -port=8081` locally, or on a different machine, or on thousands of machines. That is it!

# Introduction #

SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

1. to store billions of files!
2. to serve the files fast!

SeaweedFS started as a blob store to handle small files efficiently. 
Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, 
the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, 
and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. 
This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, 
allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation).

There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file&#039;s metadata. 
It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases.

SeaweedFS started by implementing [Facebook&#039;s Haystack design paper](http://www.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf). 
Also, SeaweedFS implements erasure coding with ideas from 
[f4: Facebook’s Warm BLOB Storage System](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-muralidhar.pdf), and has a lot of similarities with [Facebook’s Tectonic Filesystem](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast21-pan.pdf) and [Google&#039;s Colossus File System](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system)

On top of the blob store, optional [Filer] can support directories and POSIX attributes. 
Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, 
e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc.

SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud. 
With hot data on local cluster, and warm data on the cloud with O(1) access time, 
SeaweedFS can achieve both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity.
What&#039;s more, the cloud storage access API cost is minimized. 
Faster and cheaper than direct cloud storage!

# Features #
## Additional Blob Store Features ##
* Support different replication levels, with rack and data center aware.
* Automatic master servers failover - no single point of failure (SPOF).
* Automatic compression depending on file MIME type.
* Automatic compaction to reclaim disk space after deletion or update.
* [Automatic entry TTL expiration][VolumeServerTTL].
* Flexible Capacity Expansion: Any server with some disk space can add to the total storage space.
* Adding/Removing servers does **not** cause any data re-balancing unless triggered by admin commands.
* Optional picture resizing.
* Support ETag, Accept-Range, Last-Modified, etc.
* Support in-memory/leveldb/readonly mode tuning for memory/performance balance.
* Support rebalancing the writable and readonly volumes.
* [Customizable Multiple Storage Tiers][TieredStorage]: Customizable storage disk types to balance performance and cost.
* [Transparent cloud integration][CloudTier]: unlimited capacity via tiered cloud storage for warm data.
* [Erasure Coding for warm storage][ErasureCoding]  Rack-Aware 10.4 erasure coding reduces storage cost and increases availability. Enterprise version can customize EC ratio.

## Example: Using Seaweed Blob Store ##

By default, the master node runs on port 9333, and the volume nodes run on port 8080.
Let&#039;s start one master node, and two volume nodes on port 8080 and 8081. Ideally, they should be started from different machines. We&#039;ll use localhost as an example.

SeaweedFS uses HTTP REST operations to read, write, and delete. The responses are in JSON or JSONP format.

### Start Master Server ###

```
&gt; ./weed master
```

### Start Volume Servers ###

```
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data1&quot; -max=5  -master=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8080 &amp;
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data2&quot; -max=10 -master=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8081 &amp;
```

### Write A Blob ###

A blob, also referred as a needle, a chunk, or mistakenly as a file, is just a byte array. It can have attributes, such as name, mime type, create or update time, etc. But basically it is just a byte array of a relatively small size, such as 2 MB ~ 64 MB. The size is not fixed.

To upload a blob: first, send a HTTP POST, PUT, or GET request to `/dir/assign` to get an `fid` and a volume server URL:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign
{&quot;count&quot;:1,&quot;fid&quot;:&quot;3,01637037d6&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;,&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}
```

Second, to store the blob content, send a HTTP multi-part POST request to `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` from the response:

```
&gt; curl -F file=@/home/chris/myphoto.jpg http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;myphoto.jpg&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:43234,&quot;eTag&quot;:&quot;1cc0118e&quot;}
```

To update, send another POST request with updated blob content.

For deletion, send an HTTP DELETE request to the same `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` URL:

```
&gt; curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
```

### Save Blob Id ###

Now, you can save the `fid`, 3,01637037d6 in this case, to a database field.

The number 3 at the start represents a volume id. After the comma, it&#039;s one file key, 01, and a file cookie, 637037d6.

The volume id is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The file key is an unsigned 64-bit integer. The file cookie is an unsigned 32-bit integer, used to prevent URL guessing.

The file key and file cookie are both coded in hex. You can store the &lt;volume id, file key, file cookie&gt; tuple in your own format, or simply store the `fid` as a string.

If stored as a string, in theory, you would need 8+1+16+8=33 bytes. A char(33) would be enough, if not more than enough, since most uses will not need 2^32 volumes.

If space is really a concern, you can store the file id in the binary format. You would need one 4-byte integer for volume id, 8-byte long number for file key, and a 4-byte integer for the file cookie. So 16 bytes are more than enough.

### Read a Blob ###

Here is an example of how to render the URL.

First look up the volume server&#039;s URLs by the file&#039;s volumeId:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/lookup?volumeId=3
{&quot;volumeId&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}]}
```

Since (usually) there are not too many volume servers, and volumes don&#039;t move often, you can cache the results most of the time. Depending on the replication type, one volume can have multiple replica locations. Just randomly pick one location to read.

Now you can take the public URL, render the URL or directly read from the volume server via URL:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
```

Notice we add a file extension &quot;.jpg&quot; here. It&#039;s optional and just one way for the client to specify the file content type.

If you want a nicer URL, you can use one of these alternative URL formats:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6/my_preferred_name.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6
```

If you want to get a scaled version of an image, you can add some params:

```
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fit
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fill
```

### Rack-Aware and Data Center-Aware Replication ###

SeaweedFS applies the replication strategy at a volume level. So, when you are getting a blob id, you can specify the replication strategy. For example:

```
curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?replication=001
```

The replication parameter options are:

```
000: no replication
001: replicate once on the same rack
010: replicate once on a different rack, but same data center
100: replicate once on a different data center
200: replicate twice on two different data center
110: replicate once on a different rack, and once on a different data center
```

More details about replication can be found [on the wiki][Replication].

[Replication]: https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Replication

You can also set the default replication strategy when starting the master server.

### Allocate Blob Key on Specific Data Center ###

Volume servers can be started with a specific data center name:

```
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/1 -port=8080 -dataCenter=dc1
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/2 -port=8081 -dataCenter=dc2
```

When requesting a blob key, an optional &quot;dataCenter&quot; parameter can limit the assigned volume to the specific data center. For example, this specifies that the assigned volume should be limited to &#039;dc1&#039;:

```
 http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?dataCenter=dc1
```

## Blob Store Architecture ##

Usually distributed file systems split each file into chunks. A central server keeps a mapping of filenames to chunks, and also which chunks each chunk server has.

The main drawback is that the central server can&#039;t handle many small files efficiently, and since all read requests need to go through the central master, so it might not scale well for many concurrent users.

Instead of managing chunks, SeaweedFS manages data volumes in the master server. Each data volume is 32GB in size, and can hold a lot of blobs. And each storage node can have many data volumes. So the master node only needs to store the metadata about the volumes, which is a fairly small amount of data and is generally stable.

The actual blob metadata, which are the blob volume, offset, and size, is stored in each volume on volume servers. Since each volume server only manages metadata of blobs on its own disk, with only 16 bytes for each blob, all access can read the metadata just from memory and only needs one disk operation to actually read file data.

For comparison, consider that an xfs inode structure in Linux is 536 bytes.

## Getting Started

### Before Use

The Nginx UI follows the Debian web server configuration file standard. Created site configuration files will be placed in the `sites-available` folder that under the Nginx configuration folder (auto-detected). The configuration files for an enabled site will create a soft link to the `sites-enabled` folder. You may need to adjust the way the configuration files are organised.

For non-Debian (and Ubuntu) systems, you may need to change the contents of the `nginx.conf` configuration file to the Debian style as shown below.

```nginx
http {
	# ...
	include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
	include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
}
```

For more information: [debian/conf/nginx.conf](https://salsa.debian.org/nginx-team/nginx/-/blob/master/debian/conf/nginx.conf#L59-L60)

### Installation

Nginx UI is available on the following platforms:

- macOS 11 Big Sur and later (amd64 / arm64)
- Windows 10 and later (amd64 / arm64)
- Linux 2.6.23 and later (x86 / amd64 / arm64 / armv5 / armv6 / armv7 / mips32 / mips64 / riscv64 / loongarch64)
  - Including but not limited to Debian 7 / 8, Ubuntu 12.04 / 14.04 and later, CentOS 6 / 7, Arch Linux
- FreeBSD
- OpenBSD
- Dragonfly BSD
- Openwrt

You can visit [latest release](https://github.com/0xJacky/nginx-ui/releases/latest) to download the latest distribution, or just use [installation scripts for Linux](#script-for-linux).

### Usage

In the first runtime of Nginx UI, please visit `http://&lt;your_server_ip&gt;:&lt;listen_port&gt;`
in your browser to complete the follow-up configurations.

#### From Executable
**Run Nginx UI in Terminal**

```shell
nginx-ui -config app.ini
```
Press `Control+C` in the terminal to exit Nginx UI.

**Run Nginx UI in Background**

```shell
nohup ./nginx-ui -config app.ini &amp;
```
Stop Nginx UI with the follow command.

```shell
kill -9 $(ps -aux | grep nginx-ui | grep -v grep | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039;)
```

#### With Systemd
If you are using the [installation script for Linux](#script-for-linux), the Nginx UI will be installed as `nginx-ui` service in systemd. Please use the `systemctl` command to control it.

**Start Nginx UI**

```shell
systemctl start nginx-ui
```
**Stop Nginx UI**

```shell
systemctl stop nginx-ui
```
**Restart Nginx UI**

```shell
systemctl restart nginx-ui
```

#### With Docker
Our docker image [uozi/nginx-ui:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/uozi/nginx-ui) is based on the latest nginx image and
can be used to replace the Nginx on the host. By publishing the container&#039;s port 80 and 443 to the host,
you can easily make the switch.

##### Note
1. When using this container for the first time, ensure that the volume mapped to /etc/nginx is empty.
2. If you want to host static files, you can map directories to container.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deploy with Docker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

1. [Install Docker.](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

2. Then deploy nginx-ui like this:

```bash
docker run -dit \
  --name=nginx-ui \
  --restart=always \
  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
  -v /mnt/user/appdata/nginx:/etc/nginx \
  -v /mnt/user/appdata/nginx-ui:/etc/nginx-ui \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 \
  uozi/nginx-ui:latest
```

3. When your docker container is running, Log in to nginx-ui panel with `http://&lt;your_server_ip&gt;:8080/install`.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deploy with Docker-Compose&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

1. [Install Docker-Compose.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file like this:

```yml
services:
    nginx-ui:
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        container_name: nginx-ui
        restart: always
        environment:
            - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
        volumes:
            - &#039;/mnt/user/appdata/nginx:/etc/nginx&#039;
            - &#039;/mnt/user/appdata/nginx-ui:/etc/nginx-ui&#039;
            - &#039;/var/www:/var/www&#039;
            - &#039;/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock&#039;
        ports:
            - 8080:80
            - 8443:443
        image: &#039;uozi/nginx-ui:latest&#039;
```

3. Then creat your container by:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. When your docker container is running, Log in to nginx-ui panel with `http://&lt;your_server_ip&gt;:8080/install`.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Manual Build

On platforms that do not have an official build version, they can be built manually.

### Prerequisites

- Make

- Golang 1.23+

- node.js 21+

  ```shell
  npx browserslist@latest --update-db
  ```

### Build Frontend

Please execute the following command in `app` directory.

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Build Backend

Please build the app first, and then execute the following command in the project root directory.

```shell
go generate
go build -tags=jsoniter -ldflags &quot;$LD_FLAGS -X &#039;github.com/0xJacky/Nginx-UI/settings.buildTime=$(date +%s)&#039;&quot; -o nginx-ui -v main.go
```

## Script for Linux

### Basic Usage

**Install and Upgrade**

```shell
bash -c &quot;$(curl -L https://cloud.nginxui.com/install.sh)&quot; @ install
```
The default listening port is `9000`, and the default HTTP Challenge port is `9180`.
If there is a port conflict, please modify `/usr/local/etc/nginx-ui/app.ini` manually,
then use `systemctl restart nginx-ui` to reload the Nginx UI service.

**Remove Nginx UI, except configuration and database files**

```shell
bash -c &quot;$(curl -L https://cloud.nginxui.com/install.sh)&quot; @ remove
```

✨ **`samber/lo` is a Lodash-style Go library based on Go 1.18+ Generics.**

A utility library based on Go 1.18+ generics that makes it easier to work with slices, maps, strings, channels, and functions. It provides dozens of handy methods to simplify common coding tasks and improve code readability. It may look like [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) in some aspects.

5 to 10 helpers may overlap with those from the Go standard library, in packages `slices` and `maps`. I feel this library is legitimate and offers many more valuable abstractions.

**See also:**

- [samber/ro](https://github.com/samber/ro): Reactive Programming for Go: declarative and composable API for event-driven applications
- [samber/do](https://github.com/samber/do): A dependency injection toolkit based on Go 1.18+ Generics
- [samber/mo](https://github.com/samber/mo): Monads based on Go 1.18+ Generics (Option, Result, Either...)

What makes it different from **samber/ro**?
- lo: synchronous helpers across finite sequences (maps, slices...)
- ro: processing of infinite data streams for event-driven scenarios

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	I’m going all-in on open-source for the coming months.
	&lt;br&gt;
	Help sustain development: Become an &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/sponsors/samber&quot;&gt;individual sponsor&lt;/a&gt; or join as a &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hey@samuel-berthe.fr&quot;&gt;corporate sponsor&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

----

**Why this name?**

I wanted a **short name**, similar to &quot;Lodash&quot;, and no Go package uses this name.

![lo](docs/static/img/logo-full.png)

## 🚀 Install

```sh
go get github.com/samber/lo@v1
```

This library is v1 and follows SemVer strictly.

No breaking changes will be made to exported APIs before v2.0.0.

This library has no dependencies outside the Go standard library.

## 💡 Usage

You can import `lo` using:

```go
import (
    &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;
    lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;
    lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;
    loi &quot;github.com/samber/lo/it&quot;
)
```

Then use one of the helpers below:

```go
names := lo.Uniq([]string{&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Samuel&quot;})
// []string{&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;John&quot;}
```

### Tips for lazy developers

I cannot recommend it, but in case you are too lazy for repeating `lo.` everywhere, you can import the entire library into the namespace.

```go
import (
    . &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;
)
```

I take no responsibility for this junk. 😁 💩

Constraints:

- Clonable

### Filter

Iterates over a collection and returns a slice of all the elements the predicate function returns `true` for.

```go
even := lo.Filter([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int, index int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0
})
// []int{2, 4}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/Apjg3WeSi7K)]

Mutable: like `lo.Filter()`, but the slice is updated in place.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
newList := lom.Filter(list, func(x int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0
})

list
// []int{2, 4, 3, 4}

newList
// []int{2, 4}
```

### Map

Manipulates a slice of one type and transforms it into a slice of another type:

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, index int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)
})
// []string{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/OkPcYAhBo0D)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.Map()`, but the transform function is called in a goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, _ int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)
})
// []string{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/sCJaB3quRMC)]

Mutable: like `lo.Map()`, but the slice is updated in place.

```go
import lom &quot;github.com/samber/lo/mutable&quot;

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
lom.Map(list, func(x int) int {
    return x*2
})
// []int{2, 4, 6, 8}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/0jY3Z0B7O_5)]

### UniqMap

Manipulates a slice and transforms it to a slice of another type with unique values.

```go
type User struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
users := []User{{Name: &quot;Alex&quot;, Age: 10}, {Name: &quot;Alex&quot;, Age: 12}, {Name: &quot;Bob&quot;, Age: 11}, {Name: &quot;Alice&quot;, Age: 20}}

names := lo.UniqMap(users, func(u User, index int) string {
    return u.Name
})
// []string{&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/fygzLBhvUdB)]

### FilterMap

Returns a slice obtained after both filtering and mapping using the given callback function.

The callback function should return two values: the result of the mapping operation and whether the result element should be included or not.

```go
matching := lo.FilterMap([]string{&quot;cpu&quot;, &quot;gpu&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;keyboard&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) (string, bool) {
    if strings.HasSuffix(x, &quot;pu&quot;) {
        return &quot;xpu&quot;, true
    }
    return &quot;&quot;, false
})
// []string{&quot;xpu&quot;, &quot;xpu&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/-AuYXfy7opz)]

### FlatMap

Manipulates a slice and transforms and flattens it to a slice of another type. The transform function can either return a slice or a `nil`, and in the `nil` case no value is added to the final slice.

```go
lo.FlatMap([]int64{0, 1, 2}, func(x int64, _ int) []string {
    return []string{
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
    }
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/YSoYmQTA8-U)]

### Reduce

Reduces a collection to a single value. The value is calculated by accumulating the result of running each element in the collection through an accumulator function. Each successive invocation is supplied with the return value returned by the previous call.

```go
sum := lo.Reduce([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(agg int, item int, _ int) int {
    return agg + item
}, 0)
// 10
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/R4UHXZNaaUG)]

### ReduceRight

Like `lo.Reduce` except that it iterates over elements of collection from right to left.

```go
result := lo.ReduceRight([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}, func(agg []int, item []int, _ int) []int {
    return append(agg, item...)
}, []int{})
// []int{4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/Fq3W70l7wXF)]

### ForEach

Iterates over elements of a collection and invokes the function over each element.

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.ForEach([]string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints &quot;hello\nworld\n&quot;
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/oofyiUPRf8t)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.ForEach()`, but the callback is called as a goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.ForEach([]string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints &quot;hello\nworld\n&quot; or &quot;world\nhello\n&quot;
```

### ForEachWhile

Iterates over collection elements and invokes iteratee for each element collection return value decide to continue or break, like do while().

```go
list := []int64{1, 2, -42, 4}

lo.ForEachWhile(list, func(x int64, _ int) bool {
	if x &lt; 0 {
		return false
	}
	fmt.Println(x)
	return true
})
// 1
// 2
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/QnLGt35tnow)]

### Times

Times invokes the iteratee n times, returning a slice of the results of each invocation. The iteratee is invoked with index as argument.

```go
import &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

lo.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/vgQj3Glr6lT)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.Times()`, but callback is called in goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;}
```

### Uniq

Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice.

```go
uniqValues := lo.Uniq([]int{1, 2, 2, 1})
// []int{1, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/DTzbeXZ6iEN)]

### UniqBy

Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice. It accepts `iteratee` which is invoked for each element in the slice to generate the criterion by which uniqueness is computed.

```go
uniqValues := lo.UniqBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// []int{0, 1, 2}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/g42Z3QSb53u)]

### GroupBy

Returns an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

groups := lo.GroupBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 3}, 1: []int{1, 4}, 2: []int{2, 5}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/XnQBd_v6brd)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.GroupBy()`, but callback is called in goroutine.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

lop.GroupBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {
    return i%3
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 3}, 1: []int{1, 4}, 2: []int{2, 5}}
```

### GroupByMap

Returns an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

groups := lo.GroupByMap([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) (int, int) {
    return i%3, i*2
})
// map[int][]int{0: []int{0, 6}, 1: []int{2, 8}, 2: []int{4, 10}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/iMeruQ3_W80)]

### Chunk

Returns a slice of elements split into groups of length size. If the slice can&#039;t be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.

```go
lo.Chunk([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2)
// [][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}

lo.Chunk([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2)
// [][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6}}

lo.Chunk([]int{}, 2)
// [][]int{}

lo.Chunk([]int{0}, 2)
// [][]int{{0}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/kEMkFbdu85g)]

### Window

Creates a slice of sliding windows of a given size. Each window shares size-1 elements with the previous one. This is equivalent to `Sliding(collection, size, 1)`.

```go
lo.Window([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 3)
// [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}}

lo.Window([]float64{20, 22, 21, 23, 24}, 3)
// [][]float64{{20, 22, 21}, {22, 21, 23}, {21, 23, 24}}
```

### Sliding

Creates a slice of sliding windows of a given size with a given step. If step is equal to size, windows have no common elements (similar to Chunk). If step is less than size, windows share common elements.

```go
// Windows with shared elements (step &lt; size)
lo.Sliding([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 3, 1)
// [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}, {4, 5, 6}}

// Windows with no shared elements (step == size, like Chunk)
lo.Sliding([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 3, 3)
// [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}

// Step &gt; size (skipping elements)
lo.Sliding([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, 2, 3)
// [][]int{{1, 2}, {4, 5}, {7, 8}}
```

### PartitionBy

Returns a slice of elements split into groups. The order of grouped values is determined by the order they occur in collection. The grouping is generated from the results of running each element of collection through iteratee.

```go
import lo &quot;github.com/samber/lo&quot;

partitions := lo.PartitionBy([]int{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(x int) string {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        return &quot;negative&quot;
    } else if x%2 == 0 {
        return &quot;even&quot;
    }
    return &quot;odd&quot;
})
// [][]int{{-2, -1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 5}}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/NfQ_nGjkgXW)]

Parallel processing: like `lo.PartitionBy()`, but callback is called in goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.

```go
import lop &quot;github.com/samber/lo/parallel&quot;

partitions := lop.PartitionBy([]int{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(x int) string {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        return &quot;negative&quot;
    } else if x%2 == 0 {
        return &quot;even&quot;
    }
    return &quot;odd&quot;
})
// [][]int{{-2, -1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 5}}
```

### Flatten

Returns a slice a single level deep.

```go
flat := lo.Flatten([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 5}})
// []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

[[play](https://go.dev/play/p/rbp9ORaMpjw)]

### Concat

Returns a new slice containing all the elements in collections. Concat conserves the order of the elements.

```go
slice :

## Getting Started

- [Quick Start](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/getting-started/quickstart)
- [Installation guide](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/introduction/installation)

## Technical Details

### Core Concepts

- **Agents**: Agents are the main building block of kagent. They are a system prompt, a set of tools and agents, and an LLM configuration represented with a Kubernetes custom resource called &quot;Agent&quot;. 
- **LLM Providers**: Kagent supports multiple LLM providers, including [OpenAI](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/openai), [Azure OpenAI](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/azure-openai), [Anthropic](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/anthropic), [Google Vertex AI](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/google-vertexai), [Ollama](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/ollama) and any other [custom providers and models](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/supported-providers/custom-models) accessible via AI gateways. Providers are represented by the ModelConfig resource.
- **MCP Tools**: Agents can connect to any MCP server that provides tools. Kagent comes with an MCP server with tools for Kubernetes, Istio, Helm, Argo, Prometheus, Grafana, Cilium, and others. All tools are Kubernetes custom resources (ToolServers) and can be used by multiple agents.
- **Observability**: Kagent supports [OpenTelemetry tracing](https://kagent.dev/docs/kagent/getting-started/tracing), which allows you to monitor what&#039;s happening with your agents and tools.

### Core Principles

- **Kubernetes Native**: Kagent is designed to be easy to understand and use, and to provide a flexible and powerful way to build and manage AI agents.
- **Extensible**: Kagent is designed to be extensible, so you can add your own agents and tools.
- **Flexible**: Kagent is designed to be flexible, to suit any AI agent use case.
- **Observable**: Kagent is designed to be observable, so you can monitor the agents and tools using all common monitoring frameworks.
- **Declarative**: Kagent is designed to be declarative, so you can define the agents and tools in a YAML file.
- **Testable**: Kagent is designed to be tested and debugged easily. This is especially important for AI agent applications.

### Architecture

The kagent framework is designed to be easy to understand and use, and to provide a flexible and powerful way to build and manage AI agents.

  &lt;img src=&quot;img/arch.png&quot; alt=&quot;kagent&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Kagent has 4 core components:

- **Controller**: The controller is a Kubernetes controller that watches the kagent custom resources and creates the necessary resources to run the agents.
- **UI**: The UI is a web UI that allows you to manage the agents and tools.
- **Engine**: The engine runs your agents using [ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/).
- **CLI**: The CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage the agents and tools.

![Crossplane](banner.png)

Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
needing to write code. It has a highly extensible backend that enables you to
build a control plane that can orchestrate applications and infrastructure no
matter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend that puts you in
control of the schema of the declarative API it offers.

Crossplane is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][cncf] project.

## Get Started

Crossplane&#039;s [Get Started Docs] covers install and resource quickstarts.

## Roadmap

The public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues
added to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the
community, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.

The maintainer team regularly triages requests from the community to identify
features and issues of suitable scope and impact to include in this roadmap. The
community is encouraged to show their support for potential roadmap issues by
adding a :+1: reaction, leaving descriptive comments, and attending the
[regular community meetings] to discuss their requirements and use cases.

The maintainer team updates the roadmap on an as needed basis, in response to
demand, priority, and available resources. The public roadmap can be updated at
any time.

Milestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of
overall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered
approximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific
delivery timeline.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># kustomize

`kustomize` lets you customize raw, template-free YAML
files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML
untouched and usable as is.

`kustomize` targets kubernetes; it understands and can
patch [kubernetes style] API objects.  It&#039;s like
[`make`], in that what it does is declared in a file,
and it&#039;s like [`sed`], in that it emits edited text.

This tool is sponsored by [sig-cli] ([KEP]).

## kubectl integration

To find the kustomize version embedded in recent versions of kubectl, run `kubectl version`:

```sh
&gt; kubectl version --client
Client Version: v1.31.0
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
```

The kustomize build flow at [v2.0.3] was added
to [kubectl v1.14][kubectl announcement].  The kustomize
flow in kubectl remained frozen at v2.0.3 until kubectl v1.21,
which [updated it to v4.0.5][kust-in-kubectl update]. It will
be updated on a regular basis going forward, and such updates
will be reflected in the Kubernetes release notes.

| Kubectl version | Kustomize version |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| &lt; v1.14         | n/a               |
| v1.14-v1.20     | v2.0.3            |
| v1.21           | v4.0.5            |
| v1.22           | v4.2.0            |
| v1.23           | v4.4.1            |
| v1.24           | v4.5.4            |
| v1.25           | v4.5.7            |

## Usage


### 1) Make a [kustomization] file

In some directory containing your YAML [resource]
files (deployments, services, configmaps, etc.), create a
[kustomization] file.

This file should declare those resources, and any
customization to apply to them, e.g. _add a common
label_.

```

base: kustomization + resources

kustomization.yaml                                      deployment.yaml                                                 service.yaml
+---------------------------------------------+         +-------------------------------------------------------+       +-----------------------------------+

```

File structure:

&gt; ```
&gt; ~/someApp
&gt; ├── deployment.yaml
&gt; ├── kustomization.yaml
&gt; └── service.yaml
&gt; ```

The resources in this directory could be a fork of
someone else&#039;s configuration.  If so, you can easily
rebase from the source material to capture
improvements, because you don&#039;t modify the resources
directly.

Generate customized YAML with:

```
kustomize build ~/someApp
```

The YAML can be directly [applied] to a cluster:

&gt; ```
&gt; kustomize build ~/someApp | kubectl apply -f -
&gt; ```


### 2) Create [variants] using [overlays]

Manage traditional [variants] of a configuration - like
_development_, _staging_ and _production_ - using
[overlays] that modify a common [base].

```

```


File structure:
&gt; ```
&gt; ~/someApp
&gt; ├── base
&gt; │   ├── deployment.yaml
&gt; │   ├── kustomization.yaml
&gt; │   └── service.yaml
&gt; └── overlays
&gt;     ├── development
&gt;     │   ├── cpu_count.yaml
&gt;     │   ├── kustomization.yaml
&gt;     │   └── replica_count.yaml
&gt;     └── production
&gt;         ├── cpu_count.yaml
&gt;         ├── kustomization.yaml
&gt;         └── replica_count.yaml
&gt; ```

Take the work from step (1) above, move it into a
`someApp` subdirectory called `base`, then
place overlays in a sibling directory.

An overlay is just another kustomization, referring to
the base, and referring to patches to apply to that
base.

This arrangement makes it easy to manage your
configuration with `git`.  The base could have files
from an upstream repository managed by someone else.
The overlays could be in a repository you own.
Arranging the repo clones as siblings on disk avoids
the need for git submodules (though that works fine, if
you are a submodule fan).

Generate YAML with

```sh
kustomize build ~/someApp/overlays/production
```

The YAML can be directly [applied] to a cluster:

&gt; ```sh
&gt; kustomize build ~/someApp/overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -
&gt; ```

Grafana Tempo is an open source, easy-to-use, and high-scale distributed tracing backend. Tempo is cost-efficient, requiring only object storage to operate, and is deeply integrated with Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki.


## Business value of distributed tracing

Distributed tracing helps teams quickly pinpoint performance issues and understand the flow of requests across services. The Traces Drilldown UI simplifies this process by offering a user-friendly interface to view and analyze trace data, making it easier to identify and resolve issues without needing to write complex queries.

Refer to [Use traces to find solutions](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/introduction/solutions-with-traces/) to learn more about how you can use distributed tracing to investigate and solve issues.

## Traces Drilldown UI: A better way to get value from your tracing data
We are excited to introduce the [Traces Drilldown](https://github.com/grafana/traces-drilldown) (formerly Explore Traces) app as part of the Grafana Explore suite. This app provides a queryless and intuitive experience for analyzing tracing data, allowing teams to quickly identify performance issues, latency bottlenecks, and errors without needing to write complex queries or use TraceQL.

Key Features:
- **Intuitive Trace Analysis**: Spot slow or error-prone traces with easy, point-and-click interactions.
- **RED Metrics Overview**: Use Rate, Errors, and Duration metrics to highlight performance issues.
- **Automated Comparison**: Identify problematic attributes with automatic trace comparison.
- **Simplified Visualizations**: Access rich visual data without needing to construct TraceQL queries.

- [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uB1C2oHA4)

## TraceQL

Tempo implements [TraceQL](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/traceql/), a traces-first query language inspired by LogQL and PromQL, which enables targeted queries or rich UI-driven analyses.

### TraceQL metrics

[TraceQL metrics](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/traceql/metrics-queries/) is an experimental feature in Grafana Tempo that creates metrics from traces. Metric queries extend trace queries by applying a function to trace query results. This powerful feature allows for ad hoc aggregation of any existing TraceQL query by any dimension available in your traces, much in the same way that LogQL metric queries create metrics from logs.

Tempo is Jaeger, Zipkin, Kafka, OpenCensus, and OpenTelemetry compatible. It ingests batches in any of the mentioned formats, buffers them, and then writes them to Azure, GCS, S3, or local disk. As such, it&#039;s robust, cheap, and easy to operate.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Google Cloud Client Libraries for Go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/cloud.google.com/go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go)

Go packages for [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) services.

## Installation

```bash
go get cloud.google.com/go/firestore@latest # Replace firestore with the package you want to use.
```

**NOTE:** Some of these packages are under development, and may occasionally
make backwards-incompatible changes.

## Supported APIs

For an updated list of all of our released APIs please see our
[reference docs](https://cloud.google.com/go/docs/reference).

## [Go Versions Supported](#supported-versions)

Our libraries are compatible with the two most recent major Go
releases, the same [policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy) the Go
programming language follows. This means the currently supported versions are:

- Go 1.24
- Go 1.25

## Authentication

By default, each client library will use [Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials)
(ADC) to automatically configure the credentials used in calling the API endpoint.
When using the libraries in a Google Cloud Platform environment such as Compute
Engine, Kubernetes Engine, or App Engine, no additional authentication steps are
necessary. See [Authentication methods at Google](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication)
and [Authenticate for using client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/client-libraries)
for more information.

```go
client, err := storage.NewClient(ctx)
```

For applications running elsewhere, such as your local development environment,
you can use the `gcloud auth application-default login` command from the
[Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/cli) to set user credentials in
your local filesystem. Application Default Credentials will automatically detect
these credentials. See [Set up ADC for a local development
environment](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment)
for more information.

Alternately, you may need to provide an explicit path to your credentials. To authenticate
using a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#service-accounts)
key file, either set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path
to your key file, or programmatically pass
[`option.WithCredentialsFile`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option#WithCredentialsFile)
to the `NewClient` function of the desired package. For example:

```go
client, err := storage.NewClient(ctx, option.WithCredentialsFile(&quot;path/to/keyfile.json&quot;))
```

You can exert even more control over authentication by using the
[credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/auth/credentials) package to
create an [auth.Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/auth#Credentials).
Then pass [`option.WithAuthCredentials`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option#WithAuthCredentials)
to the `NewClient` function:

```go
creds, err := credentials.DetectDefault(&amp;credentials.DetectOptions{...})
...
client, err := storage.NewClient(ctx, option.WithAuthCredentials(creds))
```

**Talos** is a modern OS for running Kubernetes: secure, immutable, and minimal.
Talos is fully open source, production-ready, and supported by the people at [Sidero Labs](https://www.SideroLabs.com/).
All system management is done via an API - there is no shell or interactive console.
Benefits include:

- **Security**: Talos reduces your attack surface: It&#039;s minimal, hardened, and immutable.
  All API access is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
- **Predictability**: Talos eliminates configuration drift, reduces unknown factors by employing immutable infrastructure ideology, and delivers atomic updates.
- **Evolvability**: Talos simplifies your architecture, increases your agility, and always delivers current stable Kubernetes and Linux versions.

 ## 注意：源码公布到1.4.10版本，后续暂无继续开源计划。

 ## 麻烦各位大佬发表lucky相关教程的时候不要加上“开源”神器，开源二字我不配，lucky后续也没开源打算。
        1.开源并不等于安全，闭源并不等于不安全。闭源软件开发也会受到安全人员的审查。无论是开源还是闭源软件，都有可能会受到各种安全人员的审查和研究。安全人员可以使用各种技术手段来检测软件的安全性和漏洞。
        2. 个人观点lucky这种应用类软件更多只是体力活，毫无技术含量，开源的优势在于透明度和社区参与，更多劳动力参与，但也可能导致功能过多、复杂度增加的问题。闭源软件的优势在于我想怎么写就怎么写,即使还未能从lucky中获利，lucky对我也有更深的特殊含义。
        3. 我对lucky的规划还有一大部分未实现，不想被人当免费劳动力使唤，不解释太多，就这样。

 
 ## 如果您是第一次使用Lucky，请务必先访问 https://lucky666.cn ，并仔细阅读相关的文档，以获得必要的信息和答案。在这些文档中，您可以了解到Lucky的基本功能和特性，掌握Lucky的使用方法，以及解决常见的问题和疑惑。

## 一键安装

- [一键安装详看这里](https://github.com/gdy666/lucky-files)


## OpenwrtIPK包安装

- [Openwrt IPK包](https://github.com/gdy666/luci-app-lucky)


## 使用
    

- 默认后台管理地址 http://&lt;运行设备IP&gt;:16601
  默认登录账号: 666
  默认登录密码: 666

- 常规使用请用 -cd &lt;配置文件夹路径&gt; 指定配置文件夹的方式运行 
    ```bash
    #仅指定配置文件夹路径(如果配置文件夹不存在会自动创建),建议使用绝对路径
    lucky -cd luckyconf

    ```




## Docker中使用

- 不挂载主机目录, 删除容器同时会删除配置

  ```bash
  # host模式, 同时支持IPv4/IPv6, Liunx系统推荐
  docker run -d --name lucky --restart=always --net=host gdy666/lucky
  # 桥接模式, 只支持IPv4, Mac/Windows推荐,windows 不推荐使用docker版本

Beads provides a persistent, structured memory for coding agents. It replaces messy markdown plans with a dependency-aware graph, allowing agents to handle long-horizon tasks without losing context.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install beads CLI (system-wide - don&#039;t clone this repo into your project)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Initialize in YOUR project
cd your-project
bd init

# Tell your agent
echo &quot;Use &#039;bd&#039; for task tracking&quot; &gt;&gt; AGENTS.md
```

**Note:** Beads is a CLI tool you install once and use everywhere. You don&#039;t need to clone this repository into your project.

## 🛠 Features

* **Git as Database:** Issues stored as JSONL in `.beads/`. Versioned, branched, and merged like code.
* **Agent-Optimized:** JSON output, dependency tracking, and auto-ready task detection.
* **Zero Conflict:** Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) prevent merge collisions in multi-agent/multi-branch workflows.
* **Invisible Infrastructure:** SQLite local cache for speed; background daemon for auto-sync.
* **Compaction:** Semantic &quot;memory decay&quot; summarizes old closed tasks to save context window.

## 📖 Essential Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers. |
| `bd create &quot;Title&quot; -p 0` | Create a P0 task. |
| `bd update &lt;id&gt; --claim` | Atomically claim a task (sets assignee + in_progress). |
| `bd dep add &lt;child&gt; &lt;parent&gt;` | Link tasks (blocks, related, parent-child). |
| `bd show &lt;id&gt;` | View task details and audit trail. |

## 🔗 Hierarchy &amp; Workflow

Beads supports hierarchical IDs for epics:

* `bd-a3f8` (Epic)
* `bd-a3f8.1` (Task)
* `bd-a3f8.1.1` (Sub-task)

**Stealth Mode:** Run `bd init --stealth` to use Beads locally without committing files to the main repo. Perfect for personal use on shared projects.

**Contributor vs Maintainer:** When working on open-source projects:

* **Contributors** (forked repos): Run `bd init --contributor` to route planning issues to a separate repo (e.g., `~/.beads-planning`). Keeps experimental work out of PRs.
* **Maintainers** (write access): Beads auto-detects maintainer role via SSH URLs or HTTPS with credentials. Only need `git config beads.role maintainer` if using GitHub HTTPS without credentials but you have write access.

## 📦 Installation

* **npm:** `npm install -g @beads/bd`
* **Homebrew:** `brew install beads`
* **Go:** `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`

**Requirements:** Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, or Windows.

## 🚀 Overview

Pulse is a modern, unified dashboard for monitoring your **infrastructure** across Proxmox, Docker, and Kubernetes. It consolidates metrics, alerts, and AI-powered insights from all your systems into a single, beautiful interface.

Designed for homelabs, sysadmins, and MSPs who need a &quot;single pane of glass&quot; without the complexity of enterprise monitoring stacks.

![Pulse Dashboard](docs/images/01-dashboard.jpg)

## 🧭 Unified Navigation

Pulse now groups everything by task instead of data source:
- **Infrastructure** for hosts and nodes
- **Workloads** for VMs and containers
- **Storage** and **Backups** as top-level views
- **Services** for PMG instances (when connected)

Power-user shortcuts:
- `g i` → Infrastructure, `g w` → Workloads, `?` → shortcuts help
- `/` or `Cmd/Ctrl+K` → global search

## ✨ Features

### Core Monitoring
- **Unified Monitoring**: View health and metrics for PVE, PBS, PMG, Docker, and Kubernetes in one place
- **Smart Alerts**: Get notified via Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email, and more
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds Proxmox nodes on your network
- **Metrics History**: Persistent storage with configurable retention
- **Backup Explorer**: Visualize backup jobs and storage usage

### AI-Powered
- **Chat Assistant (BYOK)**: Ask questions about your infrastructure in natural language
- **Patrol (BYOK)**: Background health checks that generate findings on a schedule
- **Alert Analysis (Pro)**: Optional AI analysis when alerts fire
- **Cost Tracking**: Track usage and costs per provider/model

### Multi-Platform
- **Proxmox VE/PBS/PMG**: Full monitoring and management
- **Kubernetes**: Complete K8s cluster monitoring via agents
- **Docker/Podman**: Container and Swarm service monitoring
- **OCI Containers**: Proxmox 9.1+ native container support

### Security &amp; Operations
- **Secure by Design**: Credentials encrypted at rest, strict API scoping
- **One-Click Updates**: Easy upgrades for supported deployments
- **OIDC/SSO**: Single sign-on authentication
- **Privacy Focused**: No telemetry, all data stays on your server

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Option 1: Proxmox LXC (Recommended)
Run this one-liner on your Proxmox host to create a lightweight LXC container:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rcourtman/Pulse/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

Note: this installs the Pulse **server**. Agent installs use the command generated in **Settings → Agents → Installation commands** (served from `/install.sh` on your Pulse server).

### Option 2: Docker
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pulse \
  -p 7655:7655 \
  -v pulse_data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  rcourtman/pulse:latest
```

Access the dashboard at `http://&lt;your-ip&gt;:7655`.

Traefik (pronounced _traffic_) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.
Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/), [Rancher v2](https://rancher.com), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.
Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the _only_ configuration step you need.

:warning: When migrating to a new major version of Traefik, please refer to the [migration guide](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/migrate/v2-to-v3/) to ensure a smooth transition and to be aware of any breaking changes.


## Overview

Imagine that you have deployed a bunch of microservices with the help of an orchestrator (like Swarm or Kubernetes) or a service registry (like etcd or consul).
Now you want users to access these microservices, and you need a reverse proxy.

Traditional reverse-proxies require that you configure _each_ route that will connect paths and subdomains to _each_ microservice. 
In an environment where you add, remove, kill, upgrade, or scale your services _many_ times a day, the task of keeping the routes up to date becomes tedious. 

**This is when Traefik can help you!**

Traefik listens to your service registry/orchestrator API and instantly generates the routes so your microservices are connected to the outside world -- without further intervention from your part. 

**Run Traefik and let it do the work for you!** 
_(But if you&#039;d rather configure some of your routes manually, Traefik supports that too!)_

## Key Features

- **[Distributed Transactions](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/distributed-transactions-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB uses a two-phase commit protocol to ensure ACID compliance, providing strong consistency. Transactions span multiple nodes, and TiDB&#039;s distributed nature ensures data correctness even in the presence of network partitions or node failures.

- **[Horizontal and Vertical Scalability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/scale-tidb-using-tiup?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes or vertically by increasing resources of existing nodes, all without downtime. TiDB&#039;s architecture separates computing from storage, enabling you to adjust both independently as needed for flexibility and growth.

- **[High Availability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/high-availability-with-multi-az?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Built-in Raft consensus protocol ensures reliability and automated failover. Data is stored in multiple replicas, and transactions are committed only after writing to the majority of replicas, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability, even if some replicas fail. Geographic placement of replicas can be configured for different disaster tolerance levels.

- **[Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP)](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/htap-demystified-defining-modern-data-architecture-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB provides two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. The TiDB Server coordinates query execution across both TiKV and TiFlash to optimize performance.

- **[Cloud-Native](https://www.pingcap.com/cloud-native?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be deployed in public clouds, on-premises, or natively in Kubernetes. [TiDB Operator](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) helps manage TiDB on Kubernetes, automating cluster operations, while [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) provides a fully-managed service for easy and economical deployment, allowing users to set up clusters with just a few clicks.

- **[MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/mysql-compatibility?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB is compatible with MySQL 8.0, allowing you to use familiar protocols, frameworks and tools. You can migrate applications to TiDB without changing any code, or with minimal modifications. Additionally, TiDB provides a suite of [data migration tools](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/ecosystem-tool-user-guide?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) to help easily migrate application data into TiDB.

- **[Open Source Commitment](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/open-source-is-in-our-dna-reaffirming-tidb-commitment?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Open source is at the core of TiDB&#039;s identity. All source code is available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license, including enterprise-grade features. TiDB is built with the belief that open source enables transparency, innovation, and collaboration. We actively encourage contributions from the community to help build a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem, reaffirming our commitment to open development and accessibility for everyone.
