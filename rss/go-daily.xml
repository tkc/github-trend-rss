## Overview&lt;a name=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

[git-bug](https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug) is a standalone, distributed,
offline-first issue management tool that embeds issues, comments, and more as
objects in a git repository (_not files!_), enabling you to push and pull them
to one or more remotes.

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.

## Documentation

This README is a part of the complete documentation, available [here](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/).

## What It Does

Inspired by [Kubernetes DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns), Kubernetes&#039; cluster-internal DNS server, ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers.
Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/api/) to determine a desired list of DNS records.
*Unlike* KubeDNS, however, it&#039;s not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly—e.g. [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/).

In a broader sense, ExternalDNS allows you to control DNS records dynamically via Kubernetes resources in a DNS provider-agnostic way.

The [FAQ](docs/faq.md) contains additional information and addresses several questions about key concepts of ExternalDNS.

To see ExternalDNS in action, have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HQ2XgL9YVI) or read this [blogpost](https://codemine.be/posts/20190125-devops-eks-externaldns/).

## The Latest Release

- [current release process](./docs/release.md)

ExternalDNS allows you to keep selected zones (via `--domain-filter`) synchronized with Ingresses and Services of `type=LoadBalancer` and nodes in various DNS providers:

ExternalDNS is, by default, aware of the records it is managing, therefore it can safely manage non-empty hosted zones.
We strongly encourage you to set `--txt-owner-id` to a unique value that doesn&#039;t change for the lifetime of your cluster.
You might also want to run ExternalDNS in a dry run mode (`--dry-run` flag) to see the changes to be submitted to your DNS Provider API.

Note that all flags can be replaced with environment variables; for instance,
`--dry-run` could be replaced with `EXTERNAL_DNS_DRY_RUN=1`.

## New providers

No new provider will be added to ExternalDNS *in-tree*.

ExternalDNS has introduced a webhook system, which can be used to add a new provider.
See PR #3063 for all the discussions about it.

Known providers using webhooks:

## Status of in-tree providers

ExternalDNS supports multiple DNS providers which have been implemented by the [ExternalDNS contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/graphs/contributors).
Maintaining all of those in a central repository is a challenge, which introduces lots of toil and potential risks.

This mean that `external-dns` has begun the process to move providers out of tree. See #4347 for more details.
Those who are interested can create a webhook provider based on an *in-tree* provider and after submit a PR to reference it here.

We define the following stability levels for providers:

- **Stable**: Used for smoke tests before a release, used in production and maintainers are active.
- **Beta**: Community supported, well tested, but maintainers have no access to resources to execute integration tests on the real platform and/or are not using it in production.
- **Alpha**: Community provided with no support from the maintainers apart from reviewing PRs.

The following table clarifies the current status of the providers according to the aforementioned stability levels:

| Provider | Status | Maintainers |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Google Cloud DNS | Stable | |
| AWS Route 53 | Stable | |
| AWS Cloud Map | Beta | |
| Akamai Edge DNS | Beta | |
| AzureDNS | Stable | |

### Running Locally

See the [contributor guide](docs/contributing/getting-started.md) for details on compiling
from source.

#### Setup Steps

Next, run an application and expose it via a Kubernetes Service:

```console
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80
kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

Annotate the Service with your desired external DNS name. Make sure to change `example.org` to your domain.

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname=nginx.example.org.&quot;
```

Optionally, you can customize the TTL value of the resulting DNS record by using the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl` annotation:

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=10&quot;
```

For more details on configuring TTL, see [here](docs/ttl.md).

Use the internal-hostname annotation to create DNS records with ClusterIP as the target.

```console
kubectl annotate service nginx &quot;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname=nginx.internal.example.org.&quot;
```

If the service is not of type Loadbalancer you need the --publish-internal-services flag.

Locally run a single sync loop of ExternalDNS.

```console
external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service --once --dry-run
```

This should output the DNS records it will modify to match the managed zone with the DNS records you desire.
It also assumes you are running in the `default` namespace. See the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for more information regarding namespaces.

Note: TXT records will have the `my-cluster-id` value embedded. Those are used to ensure that ExternalDNS is aware of the records it manages.

Once you&#039;re satisfied with the result, you can run ExternalDNS like you would run it in your cluster: as a control loop, and **not in dry-run** mode:

```console
external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service
```

Check that ExternalDNS has created the desired DNS record for your Service and that it points to its load balancer&#039;s IP. Then try to resolve it:

```console
dig +short nginx.example.org.
104.155.60.49
```

Now you can experiment and watch how ExternalDNS makes sure that your DNS records are configured as desired. Here are a couple of things you can try out:

- Change the desired hostname by modifying the Service&#039;s annotation.
- Recreate the Service and see that the DNS record will be updated to point to the new load balancer IP.
- Add another Service to create more DNS records.
- Remove Services to clean up your managed zone.

The **tutorials** section contains examples, including Ingress resources, and shows you how to set up ExternalDNS in different environments such as other cloud providers and alternative Ingress controllers.

# Note

If using a txt registry and attempting to use a CNAME the `--txt-prefix` must be set to avoid conflicts.  Changing `--txt-prefix` will result in lost ownership over previously created records.

If `externalIPs` list is defined for a `LoadBalancer` service, this list will be used instead of an assigned load balancer IP to create a DNS record.
It&#039;s useful when you run bare metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT or in a similar setup, where a load balancer IP differs from a public IP (e.g. with [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf)).

## Contributing

Are you interested in contributing to external-dns? We, the maintainers and community, would love your
suggestions, contributions, and help! Also, the maintainers can be contacted at any time to learn more
about how to get involved.

We also encourage ALL active community participants to act as if they are maintainers, even if you don&#039;t have
&quot;official&quot; write permissions. This is a community effort, we are here to serve the Kubernetes community. If you
have an active interest and you want to get involved, you have real power! Don&#039;t assume that the only people who
can get things done around here are the &quot;maintainers&quot;. We also would love to add more &quot;official&quot; maintainers, so
show us what you can do!

The external-dns project is currently in need of maintainers for specific DNS providers. Ideally each provider
would have at least two maintainers. It would be nice if the maintainers run the provider in production, but it
is not strictly required. Provider listed [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns#status-of-in-tree-providers)
that do not have a maintainer listed are in need of assistance.

Read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and have a look at [the contributing docs](docs/contributing/dev-guide.md) to learn about building the project, the project structure, and the purpose of each package.

For an overview on how to write new Sources and Providers check out [Sources and Providers](docs/contributing/sources-and-providers.md).

## Heritage

ExternalDNS is an effort to unify the following similar projects in order to bring the Kubernetes community an easy and predictable way of managing DNS records across cloud providers based on their Kubernetes resources:

- Kops&#039; [DNS Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/HEAD/dns-controller)
- Zalando&#039;s [Mate](https://github.com/linki/mate)
- Molecule Software&#039;s [route53-kubernetes](https://github.com/wearemolecule/route53-kubernetes)

3. Auto-update the config to the latest repos&#039; versions by executing `pre-commit autoupdate`
4. Install with `pre-commit install`
5. Now you&#039;re all set!

```
➜ git commit -m &quot;this commit contains a secret&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets.................................................Failed
```

Note: to disable the gitleaks pre-commit hook you can prepend `SKIP=gitleaks` to the commit command
and it will skip running gitleaks

```
➜ SKIP=gitleaks git commit -m &quot;skip gitleaks check&quot;
Detect hardcoded secrets................................................Skipped
```

### Commands

⚠️ v8.19.0 introduced a change that deprecated `detect` and `protect`. Those commands are still available but
are hidden in the `--help` menu. Take a look at this [gist](https://gist.github.com/zricethezav/b325bb93ebf41b9c0b0507acf12810d2) for easy command translations.
If you find v8.19.0 broke an existing command (`detect`/`protect`), please open an issue.

There are three scanning modes: `git`, `dir`, and `stdin`.

#### Git
The `git` command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, gitleaks uses the `git log -p` command to scan patches.
You can configure the behavior of `git log -p` with the `log-opts` option.
For example, if you wanted to run gitleaks on a range of commits you could use the following
command: `gitleaks git -v --log-opts=&quot;--all commitA..commitB&quot; path_to_repo`. See the [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) documentation for more information.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.

#### Dir
The `dir` (aliases include `files`, `directory`) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: `gitleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file`.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will scan the current working directory.

#### Stdin
You can also stream data to gitleaks with the `stdin` command. Example: `cat some_file | gitleaks -v stdin`

### Creating a baseline

When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline,
gitleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any gitleaks report. To create a gitleaks report, run gitleaks with the `--report-path` parameter.

```
gitleaks git --report-path gitleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called gitleaks-report.json
```

Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:

```
gitleaks git --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json
```

After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.

## Pre-Commit hook

You can run Gitleaks as a pre-commit hook by copying the example `pre-commit.py` script into
your `.git/hooks/` directory.

## Load Configuration

The order of precedence is:

1. `--config/-c` option:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git --config /home/dev/customgitleaks.toml .
      ```
2. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` with the file path:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG=&quot;/home/dev/customgitleaks.toml&quot;
      gitleaks git .
      ```
3. Environment variable `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` with the file content:
      ```bash
      export GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML=`cat customgitleaks.toml`
      gitleaks git .
      ```
4. A `.gitleaks.toml` file within the target path:
      ```bash
      gitleaks git .
      ```

If none of the four options are used, then gitleaks will use the default config.

## Configuration

Gitleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:

```toml
# Title for the gitleaks configuration file.
title = &quot;Custom Gitleaks configuration&quot;

# You have basically two options for your custom configuration:
#
# 1. define your own configuration, default rules do not apply
#
#    use e.g., the default configuration as starting point:
#    https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
#
# 2. extend a configuration, the rules are overwritten or extended
#
#    When you extend a configuration the extended rules take precedence over the
#    default rules. I.e., if there are duplicate rules in both the extended
#    configuration and the default configuration the extended rules or
#    attributes of them will override the default rules.
#    Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain
#    together multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are
#    appended and can contain duplicates.

# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the default gitleaks config built in to the binary
# the latest version is located at:
# https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can provide a path to a configuration to extend from.
# The path is relative to where gitleaks was invoked,
# not the location of the base config.

Refer to the default [gitleaks config](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml) for examples or follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to the default configuration. Additionally, you can check out [this gitleaks blog post](https://blog.gitleaks.io/stop-leaking-secrets-configuration-2-3-aeed293b1fbf) which covers advanced configuration setups.

### Additional Configuration

#### gitleaks:allow

If you are knowingly committing a test secret that gitleaks will catch you can add a `gitleaks:allow` comment to that line which will instruct gitleaks
to ignore that secret. Ex:

```
class CustomClass:
    discord_client_secret = &#039;8dyfuiRyq=vVc3RRr_edRk-fK__JItpZ&#039;  #gitleaks:allow

```

#### .gitleaksignore

You can ignore specific findings by creating a `.gitleaksignore` file at the root of your repo. In release v8.10.0 Gitleaks added a `Fingerprint` value to the Gitleaks report. Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret. Add this fingerprint to the `.gitleaksignore` file to ignore that specific secret. See Gitleaks&#039; [.gitleaksignore](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/.gitleaksignore) for an example. Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.

#### Decoding

Sometimes secrets are encoded in a way that can make them difficult to find
with just regex. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically find and decode
encoded text. The flag `--max-decode-depth` enables this feature (the default
value &quot;0&quot; means the feature is disabled by default).

Recursive decoding is supported since decoded text can also contain encoded
text.  The flag `--max-decode-depth` sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops
when there are no new segments of encoded text to decode, so setting a really
high max depth doesn&#039;t mean it will make that many passes. It will only make as
many as it needs to decode the text. Overall, decoding only minimally increases
scan times.

The findings for encoded text differ from normal findings in the following
ways:

- The location points the bounds of the encoded text
  - If the rule matches outside the encoded text, the bounds are adjusted to
    include that as well
- The match and secret contain the decoded value
- Two tags are added `decoded:&lt;encoding&gt;` and `decode-depth:&lt;depth&gt;`

Currently supported encodings:

- **percent** - Any printable ASCII percent encoded values
- **hex** - Any printable ASCII hex encoded values &gt;= 32 characters 
- **base64** - Any printable ASCII base64 encoded values &gt;= 16 characters 

#### Reporting

Gitleaks has built-in support for several report formats: [`json`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/json_simple.json), [`csv`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/csv_simple.csv?plain=1), [`junit`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/junit_simple.xml), and [`sarif`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/sarif_simple.sarif).

If none of these formats fit your need, you can create your own report format with a [Go `text/template` .tmpl file](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-templates-in-go#step-4-writing-a-template) and the `--report-template` flag. The template can use [extended functionality from the `Masterminds/sprig`

## Introduction

Syft is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for container images and filesystems. It provides detailed visibility into the packages and dependencies in your software, helping you manage vulnerabilities, license compliance, and software supply chain security.

Syft development is sponsored by [Anchore](https://anchore.com/), and is released under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file). For commercial support options with Syft or Grype, please [contact Anchore](https://get.anchore.com/contact/).

## Features
- Generates SBOMs for container images, filesystems, archives, and more to discover packages and libraries
- Supports OCI, Docker and [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) image formats
- Linux distribution identification
- Works seamlessly with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) (a fast, modern vulnerability scanner)
- Able to create signed SBOM attestations using the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md)
- Convert between SBOM formats, such as CycloneDX, SPDX, and Syft&#039;s own format.

## Installation

Syft binaries are provided for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Recommended
&gt; ```bash 
&gt; curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
&gt; ```

Install script options:
-	`-b`: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to `./bin`)
-	`-d`: More verbose logging levels (`-d` for debug, `-dd` for trace)
-	`-v`: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to be installed)

### Homebrew
```bash
brew install syft
```

### Scoop

```powershell
scoop install syft
```

### Chocolatey

The chocolatey distribution of Syft is community-maintained and not distributed by the Anchore team

```powershell
choco install syft -y
```

### Nix

**Note**: Nix packaging of Syft is [community maintained](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/sy/syft/package.nix). Syft is available in the [stable channel](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_channels#The_official_channels) since NixOS `22.05`.

```bash
nix-env -i syft
```

... or, just try it out in an ephemeral nix shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p syft
```

## Getting started

### SBOM

To generate an SBOM for a container image:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt;
```

The above output includes only software that is visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the SBOM, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:

```bash
syft &lt;image&gt; --scope all-layers
```

### Output formats

The output format for Syft is configurable as well using the `-o` (or `--output`) option:

```
syft &lt;image&gt; -o &lt;format&gt;

            <h2>README</h2><pre># mkcert

mkcert is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It requires no configuration.

```
$ mkcert -install
Created a new local CA 💥
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ⚡️
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser restart)! 🦊

$ mkcert example.com &quot;*.example.com&quot; example.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - &quot;example.com&quot;
 - &quot;*.example.com&quot;
 - &quot;example.test&quot;
 - &quot;localhost&quot;
 - &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
 - &quot;::1&quot;

The certificate is at &quot;./example.com+5.pem&quot; and the key at &quot;./example.com+5-key.pem&quot; ✅
```

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;498&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome and Firefox screenshot&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1225294/51066373-96d4aa80-15be-11e9-91e2-f4e44a3a4458.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using certificates from real certificate authorities (CAs) for development can be dangerous or impossible (for hosts like `example.test`, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`), but self-signed certificates cause trust errors. Managing your own CA is the best solution, but usually involves arcane commands, specialized knowledge and manual steps.

mkcert automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates. mkcert does not automatically configure servers to use the certificates, though, that&#039;s up to you.

## Installation

&gt; **Warning**: the `rootCA-key.pem` file that mkcert automatically generates gives complete power to intercept secure requests from your machine. Do not share it.

### macOS

On macOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox
```

or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).

```
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install mkcert
sudo port install nss # if you use Firefox
```

### Linux

On Linux, first install `certutil`.

```
sudo apt install libnss3-tools
    -or-
sudo yum install nss-tools
    -or-
sudo pacman -S nss
    -or-
sudo zypper install mozilla-nss-tools
```

Then you can install using [Homebrew on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)

```
brew install mkcert
```

or build from source (requires Go 1.13+)

```
git clone https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert &amp;&amp; cd mkcert
go build -ldflags &quot;-X main.Version=$(git describe --tags)&quot;
```

or use [the pre-built binaries](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases).

```
curl -JLO &quot;https://dl.filippo.io/mkcert/latest?for=linux/amd64&quot;
chmod +x mkcert-v*-linux-amd64
sudo cp mkcert-v*-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert
```

For Arch Linux users, [`mkcert`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mkcert/) is available on the official Arch Linux repository.

```
sudo pacman -Syu mkcert
```

### Windows

On Windows, use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)

```
choco install mkcert
```

or use Scoop

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install mkcert
```

or build from source (requires Go 1.10+), or use [the pre-built binaries](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases).

If you&#039;re running into permission problems try running `mkcert` as an Administrator.

## Supported root stores

mkcert supports the following root stores:

* macOS system store
* Windows system store
* Linux variants that provide either
    * `update-ca-trust` (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS) or
    * `update-ca-certificates` (Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, SLES) or
    * `trust` (Arch)
* Firefox (macOS and Linux only)
* Chrome and Chromium
* Java (when `JAVA_HOME` is set)

To only install the local root CA into a subset of them, you can set the `TRUST_STORES` environment variable to a comma-separated list. Options are: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;java&quot; and &quot;nss&quot; (includes Firefox).

## Advanced topics

### Advanced options

```
	-cert-file FILE, -key-file FILE, -p12-file FILE
	    Customize the output paths.

	-client
	    Generate a certificate for client authentication.

	-ecdsa
	    Generate a certificate with an ECDSA key.

	-pkcs12
	    Generate a &quot;.p12&quot; PKCS #12 file, also know as a &quot;.pfx&quot; file,
	    containing certificate and key for legacy applications.

	-csr CSR
	    Generate a certificate based on the supplied CSR. Conflicts with
	    all other flags and arguments except -install and -cert-file.
```

&gt; **Note:** You _must_ place these options before the domain names list.

#### Example

```
mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem example.com *.example.com
```

### S/MIME

mkcert automatically generates an S/MIME certificate if one of the supplied names is an email address.

```
mkcert filippo@example.com
```

### Mobile devices

For the certificates to be trusted on mobile devices, you will have to install the root CA. It&#039;s the `rootCA.pem` file in the folder printed by `mkcert -CAROOT`.

On iOS, you can either use AirDrop, email the CA to yourself, or serve it from an HTTP server. After opening it, you need to [install the profile in Settings &gt; Profile Downloaded](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/issues/233#issuecomment-690110809) and then [enable full trust in it](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT204477).

For Android, you will have to install the CA and then enable user roots in the development build of your app. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22040887/749014).

### Using the root with Node.js

Node does not use the system root store, so it won&#039;t accept mkcert certificates automatically. Instead, you will have to set the [`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file) environment variable.

```
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=&quot;$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem&quot;
```

### Changing the location of the CA files

The CA certificate and its key are stored in an application data folder in the user home. You usually don&#039;t have to worry about it, as installation is automated, but the location is printed by `mkcert -CAROOT`.

If you want to manage separate CAs, you can use the environment variable `$CAROOT` to set the folder where mkcert will place and look for the local CA files.

### Installing the CA on other systems

Installing in the trust store does not require the CA key, so you can export the CA certificate and use mkcert to install it in other machines.

* Look for the `rootCA.pem` file in `mkcert -CAROOT`
* copy it to a different machine
* set `$CAROOT` to its directory
* run `mkcert -install`

Remember that mkcert is meant for development purposes, not production, so it should not be used on end users&#039; machines, and that you should *not* export or share `rootCA-key.pem`.

## Introduction

Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.

We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:

* [SSH nodes](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).
* [Kubernetes clusters](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction/)
* [PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/database-access/).
* [Internal Web apps](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/application-access/introduction/).
* [Windows Hosts](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/desktop-access/introduction/).
* [Networked servers](https://goteleport.com/docs/enroll-resources/server-access/introduction/).

You can set up Teleport as a [Linux daemon](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo) or a [Kubernetes deployment](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/).

Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:

- No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
- Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
- Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.

Teleport uses [Go crypto](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto). It is _fully compatible with OpenSSH_, `sshd` servers, and `ssh` clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.

## Docker

### Deploy Teleport

If you wish to deploy Teleport inside a Docker container see the
[installation guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/#running-teleport-on-docker).

### For Local Testing and Development

To run a full test suite locally, see [the test dependencies list](BUILD_macos.md#local-tests-dependencies)

## Building Teleport

The `teleport` repository contains the Teleport daemon binary (written in Go)
and a web UI written in TypeScript.

If your intention is to build and deploy for use in a production infrastructure
a released tag should be used.  The default branch, `master`, is the current
development branch for an upcoming major version.  Get the latest release tags
listed at https://goteleport.com/download/ and then use that tag in the `git clone`.
For example `git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git -b v16.0.0` gets release v16.0.0.

### Dockerized Build

It is often easiest to build with Docker, which ensures that all required
tooling is available for the build. To execute a dockerized build, ensure
that docker is installed and running, and execute:

```
make -C build.assets build-binaries
```

### Local Build

#### Dependencies

Ensure you have installed correct versions of necessary dependencies:
* `Go` version from
  [go.mod](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/go.mod#L3)
* If you wish to build the Rust-powered features like Desktop Access, see the
  `Rust` and `Cargo` versions in
  [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/Makefile#L21)
  (search for `RUST_VERSION`)
* For `tsh` version &gt; `10.x` with FIDO2 support, you will need `libfido2` and
  `pkg-config` installed locally
* To build the web UI:
  * [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack). If you have Node.js installed, run `corepack enable pnpm` to make `pnpm` available.
  * If you prefer not to install/use pnpm, but have docker available, you can run `make docker-ui` instead.
  * The `Rust` and `Cargo` version in [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/versions.mk#L11) (search for `RUST_VERSION`) are required.
  * The [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) version in [build.assets/Makefile](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/build.assets/versions.mk#L12) (search for `WASM_PACK_VERSION`) is required.
  * [`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) (which contains `wasm-opt`) is required to be installed manually
    on linux aarch64 (64-bit ARM). You can check if it&#039;s already installed on your system by running `which wasm-opt`. If not you can install it like `apt-get install binaryen` (for Debian-based Linux). `wasm-pack` will install this automatically on other platforms.

For an example of Dev Environment setup on a Mac, see [these instructions](BUILD_macos.md).

#### Perform a build

&gt;**Important**
&gt;
&gt;* The Go compiler is somewhat sensitive to the amount of memory: you will need
   **at least** 1GB of virtual memory to compile Teleport. A 512MB instance
   without swap will **not** work.
&gt;* This will build the latest version of Teleport, **regardless** of whether it
   is stable. If you want to build the latest stable release, run `git checkout`
   and `git submodule update --recursive` to the corresponding tag (for example,
&gt;* run `git checkout v8.0.0`) **before** performing a build.

Get the source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git
cd teleport
```

To perform a build

```shell
make full
```

`tsh` dynamically links against libfido2 by default, to support development
environments, as long as the library itself can be found:

```shell
$ brew install libfido2 pkg-config  # Replace with your package manager of choice

$ make build/tsh
&gt; libfido2 found, setting FIDO2=dynamic
&gt; (...)
```

Release binaries are linked statically against libfido2. You may switch the
linking mode using the FIDO2 variable:

```shell
make build/tsh FIDO2=dynamic # dynamic linking
make build/tsh FIDO2=static  # static linking, for an easy setup use `make enter`
                             # or `build.assets/macos/build-fido2-macos.sh`.
make build/tsh FIDO2=off     # doesn&#039;t link libfido2 in any way
```

`tsh` builds with Touch ID support require access to an Apple Developer account.
If you are a Teleport maintainer, ask the team for access.

#### Build output and run locally

If the build succeeds, the installer will place the binaries in the `build` directory.

Before starting, create default data directories:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p -m0700 /var/lib/teleport
sudo chown $USER /var/lib/teleport
```

#### Running Teleport in a hot reload mode

To speed up your development process, you can run Teleport using
[`CompileDaemon`](https://github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon). This will build
and run the Teleport binary, and then rebuild and restart it whenever any Go
source files change.

1. Install CompileDaemon:

    ```shell
    go install github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon@latest
    ```

    Note that we use `go install` instead of the suggested `go get`, because we
    don&#039;t want CompileDaemon to become a dependency of the project.

1. Build and run the Teleport binary:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload
    ```

    By default, this runs a `teleport start` command. If you want to customize
    the command, for example by providing a custom config file location, you can
    use the `TELEPORT_ARGS` parameter:

    ```shell
    make teleport-hot-reload TELEPORT_ARGS=&#039;start --config=/path/to/config.yaml&#039;
    ```

Note that you still need to run [`make grpc`](api/proto/README.md) if you modify
any Protocol Buffers files to regenerate the generated Go sources; regenerating
these sources should in turn cause the CompileDaemon to rebuild and restart
Teleport.

### Web UI

The Teleport Web UI resides in the [web](web) directory.

#### Rebuilding Web UI for development

To rebuild the Teleport UI package, run the following command:

```bash
make docker-ui
```

Then you can replace Teleport Web UI files with the files from the newly-generated `/dist` folder.

To enable speedy iterations on the Web UI, you can run a [local web-dev server](web#web-ui).

You can also tell Teleport to load the Web UI assets from the source directory.
To enable this behavior, set the environment variable `DEBUG=1` and rebuild with the default target:

```bash
# Run Teleport as a single-node cluster in development mode:
DEBUG=1 ./build/teleport start -d
```

Keep the server running in this mode, and make your UI changes in `/dist` directory.
For instructions about how to update the Web UI, read [the `web` README](web#readme).

### Managing dependencies

All dependencies are managed using [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules). Here are the instructions for some common tasks:

#### Add a new dependency

Latest version:

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency
```

and update the source to use this dependency.


To get a specific version, use `go get github.com/new/dependency@version` instead.

#### Set dependency to a specific version

```bash
go get github.com/new/dependency@version
```

#### Update dependency to the latest version

```bash
go get -u github.com/new/dependency
```

#### Update all dependencies

```bash
go get -u all
```

#### Debugging dependencies

Why is a specific package imported?

`go mod why $pkgname`

Why is a specific module imported?

`go mod why -m $modname`

Why is a specific version of a module imported?

`go mod graph | grep $modname`

### Devbox Build (experimental)

**Note**: Devbox support is still experimental. It&#039;s very possible things may not work as intended.

Teleport can be built using [devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox). To use devbox, follow
the instructions to install devbox [here](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/docs/quickstart/) and
then run:

`devbox shell`

This will install Teleport&#039;s various build dependencies and drop you into a shell with these
dependencies. From here, you can build Teleport normally.

#### flake.nix

A nix flake is located in `build.assets/flake` that allows for installation of Teleport&#039;s less
common build tooling. If this flake is updated, run:

`devbox install`

in order to make sure the changes in the flake are reflected in the local devbox shell.

## Why did We Build Teleport?

The Teleport creators used to work together at Rackspace. We noticed that most cloud computing users struggle with setting up and configuring infrastructure security because popular tools, while flexible, are complex to understand and expensive to maintain. Additionally, most organizations use multiple infrastructure form factors such as several cloud providers, multiple cloud accounts, servers in colocation, and even smart devices. Some of those devices run on untrusted networks, behind third-party firewalls. This only magnifies complexity and increases operational overhead.

We had a choice, either start a security consulting business or build a solution that&#039;s dead-easy to use and understand. A real-time representation of all of your servers in the same room as you, as if they were magically _teleported_. Thus, Teleport was born!

&lt;br/&gt;

💻  Plandex is a terminal-based AI development tool that can **plan and execute** large coding tasks that span many steps and touch dozens of files. It can handle up to 2M tokens of context directly (~100k per file), and can index directories with 20M tokens or more using tree-sitter project maps. 

🔬  **A cumulative diff review sandbox** keeps AI-generated changes separate from your project files until they are ready to go. Command execution is controlled so you can easily roll back and debug. Plandex helps you get the most out of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project.

🧠  **Combine the best models** from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and open source providers to build entire features and apps with a robust terminal-based workflow.

🚀  Plandex is capable of &lt;strong&gt;full autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;—it can load relevant files, plan and implement changes, execute commands, and automatically debug—but it&#039;s also highly flexible and configurable, giving developers fine-grained control and a step-by-step review process when needed.

💪  Plandex is designed to be resilient to &lt;strong&gt;large projects and files&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&#039;ve found that others tools struggle once your project gets past a certain size or the changes are too complex, give Plandex a shot.

## Smart context management that works in big projects

- 🐘 **2M token effective context window** with default model pack. Plandex loads only what&#039;s needed for each step.

- 🗄️ **Reliable in large projects and files.** Easily generate, review, revise, and apply changes spanning dozens of files.

- 🗺️ **Fast project map generation** and syntax validation with tree-sitter. Supports 30+ languages.

- 💰 **Context caching** is used across the board for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, reducing costs and latency.

## Tight control or full autonomy—it&#039;s up to you

- 🚦 **Configurable autonomy:** go from full auto mode to fine-grained control depending on the task.

- 🐞 **Automated debugging** of terminal commands (like builds, linters, tests, deployments, and scripts). If you have Chrome installed, you can also automatically debug browser applications.

## Tools that help you get production-ready results

- 💬 **A project-aware chat mode** that helps you flesh out ideas before moving to implementation. Also great for asking questions and learning about a codebase.

- 🧠 **Easily try + combine models** from multiple providers. Curated model packs offer different tradeoffs of capability, cost, and speed, as well as open source and provider-specific packs.

- 🛡️ **Reliable file edits** that prioritize correctness. While most edits are quick and cheap, Plandex validates both syntax and logic as needed, with multiple fallback layers when there are problems.

- 🔀 **Full-fledged version control** for every update to the plan, including branches for exploring multiple paths or comparing different models.

- 📂 **Git integration** with commit message generation and optional automatic commits.

## Dev-friendly, easy to install

- 🧑‍💻 **REPL mode** with fuzzy auto-complete for commands and file loading. Just run `plandex` in any project to get started.

- 🛠️ **CLI interface** for scripting or piping data into context.

- 📦 **One-line, zero dependency CLI install**. Dockerized local mode for easily self-hosting the server. Cloud-hosting options for extra reliability and convenience.

| **Plandex Cloud (BYO API Key)**       | • Use Plandex Cloud with your own [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) key (and **optionally** your own [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) key).&lt;br/&gt;• [Get started](https://app.plandex.ai/start?modelsMode=byo)                                                                   |

## Provider keys  🔑

If you&#039;re going with a &#039;BYO API Key&#039; option above (whether cloud or self-hosted), you&#039;ll need to set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable before continuing:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
```

You can also **optionally** set a `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable if you want OpenAI models to use the OpenAI API directly instead of OpenRouter (for slightly lower latency and costs):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

&lt;br/&gt;

## Get started  🚀

First, `cd` into a **project directory** where you want to get something done or chat about the project. Make a new directory first with `mkdir your-project-dir` if you&#039;re starting on a new project.

```bash
cd your-project-dir
```

For a new project, you might also want to initialize a git repo. Plandex doesn&#039;t require that your project is in a git repo, but it does integrate well with git if you use it.

```bash
git init
```

Now start the Plandex REPL in your project:

```bash
plandex
```

or for short:

```bash
pdx
```

☁️ _If you&#039;re using Plandex Cloud, you&#039;ll be prompted at this point to start a trial._

Then just give the REPL help text a quick read, and you&#039;re ready go. The REPL starts in _chat mode_ by default, which is good for fleshing out ideas before moving to implementation. Once the task is clear, Plandex will prompt you to switch to _tell mode_ to make a detailed plan and start writing code.

# cert-manager

cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.

It supports issuing certificates from a variety of sources, including Let&#039;s Encrypt (ACME), HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi TPP / TLS Protect Cloud, as well as local in-cluster issuance.

cert-manager also ensures certificates remain valid and up to date, attempting to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry to reduce the risk of outages and remove toil.

## Importing cert-manager as a Module

⚠️ Please note that cert-manager **does not** currently provide a Go module compatibility guarantee. That means that
**most code under `pkg/` is subject to change in a breaking way**, even between minor or patch releases and even if
the code is currently publicly exported.

The lack of a Go module compatibility guarantee does not affect API version guarantees
under the [Kubernetes Deprecation Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/).

For more details see [Importing cert-manager in Go](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/importing/) on the
cert-manager website.

The import path for cert-manager versions 1.8 and later is `github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager`.

For all versions of cert-manager before 1.8, including minor and patch releases, the import path is `github.com/jetstack/cert-manager`.

## Security Reporting

Security is the number one priority for cert-manager. If you think you&#039;ve found a security vulnerability, we&#039;d love to hear from you.

Follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) to make a report.

## Changelog

[Every release](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases) on GitHub has a changelog,
and we also publish release notes on [the website](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/).

## History

cert-manager is loosely based upon the work of [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego)
and has borrowed some wisdom from other similar projects such as [kube-cert-manager](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager).

![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true &quot;Docker Compose Logo&quot;)

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.

# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app&#039;s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `compose.yaml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - &quot;5000:5000&quot;
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```

Contributing
------------

Want to help develop Docker Compose? Check out our
[contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you find an issue, please report it on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).

Legacy
-------------

The Python version of Compose is available under the `v1` [branch](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1).

&gt; A Markdown parser written in Go. Easy to extend, standards-compliant, well-structured.

goldmark is compliant with CommonMark 0.31.2.

- [goldmark playground](https://yuin.github.io/goldmark/playground/) : Try goldmark online. This playground is built with WASM(5-10MB).

Motivation
----------------------
I needed a Markdown parser for Go that satisfies the following requirements:

- Easy to extend.
    - Markdown is poor in document expressions compared to other light markup languages such as reStructuredText.
    - We have extensions to the Markdown syntax, e.g. PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub Flavored Markdown.
- Standards-compliant.
    - Markdown has many dialects.
    - GitHub-Flavored Markdown is widely used and is based upon CommonMark, effectively mooting the question of whether or not CommonMark is an ideal specification.
        - CommonMark is complicated and hard to implement.
- Well-structured.
    - AST-based; preserves source position of nodes.
- Written in pure Go.

[golang-commonmark](https://gitlab.com/golang-commonmark/markdown) may be a good choice, but it seems to be a copy of [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it).

[blackfriday.v2](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/tree/v2) is a fast and widely-used implementation, but is not CommonMark-compliant and cannot be extended from outside of the package, since its AST uses structs instead of interfaces.

Furthermore, its behavior differs from other implementations in some cases, especially regarding lists: [Deep nested lists don&#039;t output correctly #329](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/issues/329), [List block cannot have a second line #244](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/issues/244), etc.

This behavior sometimes causes problems. If you migrate your Markdown text from GitHub to blackfriday-based wikis, many lists will immediately be broken.

As mentioned above, CommonMark is complicated and hard to implement, so Markdown parsers based on CommonMark are few and far between.

Features
----------------------

- **Standards-compliant.**  goldmark is fully compliant with the latest [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specification.
- **Extensible.**  Do you want to add a `@username` mention syntax to Markdown?
  You can easily do so in goldmark. You can add your AST nodes,
  parsers for block-level elements, parsers for inline-level elements,
  transformers for paragraphs, transformers for the whole AST structure, and
  renderers.
- **Performance.**  goldmark&#039;s performance is on par with that of cmark,
  the CommonMark reference implementation written in C.
- **Robust.**  goldmark is tested with `go test --fuzz`.
- **Built-in extensions.**  goldmark ships with common extensions like tables, strikethrough,
  task lists, and definition lists.
- **Depends only on standard libraries.**

### Attributes
The `parser.WithAttribute` option allows you to define attributes on some elements.

Currently only headings support attributes.

**Attributes are being discussed in the
[CommonMark forum](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/consistent-attribute-syntax/272).
This syntax may possibly change in the future.**


#### Headings

```
## heading ## {#id .className attrName=attrValue class=&quot;class1 class2&quot;}

## heading {#id .className attrName=attrValue class=&quot;class1 class2&quot;}
```

```
heading {#id .className attrName=attrValue}
============
```

### Table extension
The Table extension implements [Table(extension)](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-), as
defined in [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

Specs are defined for XHTML, so specs use some deprecated attributes for HTML5.

You can override alignment rendering method via options.

| Functional option | Type | Description |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `extension.WithTableCellAlignMethod` | `extension.TableCellAlignMethod` | Option indicates how are table cells aligned. |

### Typographer extension

The Typographer extension translates plain ASCII punctuation characters into typographic-punctuation HTML entities.

Default substitutions are:

| Punctuation | Default entity |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| `&#039;`           | `&amp;lsquo;`, `&amp;rsquo;` |
| `&quot;`           | `&amp;ldquo;`, `&amp;rdquo;` |
| `--`       | `&amp;ndash;` |
| `---`      | `&amp;mdash;` |
| `...`      | `&amp;hellip;` |
| `&lt;&lt;`       | `&amp;laquo;` |
| `&gt;&gt;`       | `&amp;raquo;` |

You can override the default substitutions via `extensions.WithTypographicSubstitutions`:

```go
markdown := goldmark.New(
    goldmark.WithExtensions(
        extension.NewTypographer(
            extension.WithTypographicSubstitutions(extension.TypographicSubstitutions{
                extension.LeftSingleQuote:  []byte(&quot;&amp;sbquo;&quot;),
                extension.RightSingleQuote: nil, // nil disables a substitution
            }),
        ),
    ),
)
```

### Linkify extension

The Linkify extension implements [Autolinks(extension)](https://github.github.com/gfm/#autolinks-extension-), as
defined in [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

Since the spec does not define details about URLs, there are numerous ambiguous cases.

You can override autolinking patterns via options.

| Functional option | Type | Description |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `extension.WithLinkifyAllowedProtocols` | `[][]byte \| []string` | List of allowed protocols such as `[]string{ &quot;http:&quot; }` |
| `extension.WithLinkifyURLRegexp` | `*regexp.Regexp` | Regexp that defines URLs, including protocols |
| `extension.WithLinkifyWWWRegexp` | `*regexp.Regexp` | Regexp that defines URL starting with `www.`. This pattern corresponds to [the extended www autolink](https://github.github.com/gfm/#extended-www-autolink) |
| `extension.WithLinkifyEmailRegexp` | `*regexp.Regexp` | Regexp that defines email addresses` |

Example, using [xurls](https://github.com/mvdan/xurls):

```go
import &quot;mvdan.cc/xurls/v2&quot;

markdown := goldmark.New(
    goldmark.WithRendererOptions(
        html.WithXHTML(),
        html.WithUnsafe(),
    ),
    goldmark.WithExtensions(
        extension.NewLinkify(
            extension.WithLinkifyAllowedProtocols([]string{
                &quot;http:&quot;,
                &quot;https:&quot;,
            }),
            extension.WithLinkifyURLRegexp(
                xurls.Strict(),
            ),
        ),
    ),
)
```

### Footnotes extension

The Footnote extension implements [PHP Markdown Extra: Footnotes](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#footnotes).

This extension has some options:

| Functional option | Type | Description |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `extension.WithFootnoteIDPrefix` | `[]byte \| string` |  a prefix for the id attributes.|
| `extension.WithFootnoteIDPrefixFunction` | `func(gast.Node) []byte` |  a function that determines the id attribute for given Node.|
| `extension.WithFootnoteLinkTitle` | `[]byte \| string` |  an optional title attribute for footnote links.|
| `extension.WithFootnoteBacklinkTitle` | `[]byte \| string` |  an optional title attribute for footnote backlinks. |
| `extension.WithFootnoteLinkClass` | `[]byte \| string` |  a class for footnote links. This defaults to `footnote-ref`. |
| `extension.WithFootnoteBacklinkClass` | `[]byte \| string` |  a class for footnote backlinks. This defaults to `footnote-backref`. |
| `extension.WithFootnoteBacklinkHTML` | `[]byte \| string` |  a class for footnote backlinks. This defaults to `&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;`. |

Some options can have special substitutions. Occurrences of “^^” in the string will be replaced by the corresponding footnote number in the HTML output. Occurrences of “%%” will be replaced by a number for the reference (footnotes can have multiple references).

`extension.WithFootnoteIDPrefix` and `extension.WithFootnoteIDPrefixFunction` are useful if you have multiple Markdown documents displayed inside one HTML document to avoid footnote ids to clash each other.

`extension.WithFootnoteIDPrefix` sets fixed id prefix, so you may write codes like the following:

```go
for _, path := range files {
    source := readAll(path)
    prefix := getPrefix(path)

    markdown := goldmark.New(
        goldmark.WithExtensions(
            NewFootnote(
                WithFootnoteIDPrefix(path),
            ),
        ),
    )
    var b bytes.Buffer
    err := markdown.Convert(source, &amp;b)
    if err != nil {
        t.Error(err.Error())
    }
}
```

`extension.WithFootnoteIDPrefixFunction` determines an id prefix by calling given function, so you may write codes like the following:

```go
markdown := goldmark.New(
    goldmark.WithExtensions(

You can use [goldmark-meta](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark-meta) to define a id prefix in the markdown document:


```markdown

title: document title
slug: article1
footnote-prefix: article1

# My article

```

### CJK extension
CommonMark gives compatibilities a high priority and original markdown was designed by westerners. So CommonMark lacks considerations for languages like CJK.

This extension provides additional options for CJK users.

| Functional option | Type | Description |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `extension.WithEastAsianLineBreaks` | `...extension.EastAsianLineBreaksStyle` | Soft line breaks are rendered as a newline. Some asian users will see it as an unnecessary space. With this option, soft line breaks between east asian wide characters will be ignored. This defaults to `EastAsianLineBreaksStyleSimple`. |
| `extension.WithEscapedSpace` | `-` | Without spaces around an emphasis started with east asian punctuations, it is not interpreted as an emphasis(as defined in CommonMark spec). With this option, you can avoid this inconvenient behavior by putting &#039;not rendered&#039; spaces around an emphasis like `太郎は\ **「こんにちわ」**\ といった`. |

#### Styles of Line Breaking

| Style | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `EastAsianLineBreaksStyleSimple` | Soft line breaks are ignored if both sides of the break are east asian wide character. This behavior is the same as [`east_asian_line_breaks`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-east_asian_line_breaks) in Pandoc. |
| `EastAsianLineBreaksCSS3Draft` | This option implements CSS text level3 [Segment Break Transformation Rules](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#line-break-transform) with [some enhancements](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5086). |

#### Example of `EastAsianLineBreaksStyleSimple`

Input Markdown:

```md
私はプログラマーです。
東京の会社に勤めています。
GoでWebアプリケーションを開発しています。
```

Output:

```html
&lt;p&gt;私はプログラマーです。東京の会社に勤めています。\nGoでWebアプリケーションを開発しています。&lt;/p&gt;
```

#### Example of `EastAsianLineBreaksCSS3Draft`

Input Markdown:

```md
私はプログラマーです。
東京の会社に勤めています。
GoでWebアプリケーションを開発しています。
```

Output:

```html
&lt;p&gt;私はプログラマーです。東京の会社に勤めています。GoでWebアプリケーションを開発しています。&lt;/p&gt;
```

Security
--------------------
By default, goldmark does not render raw HTML or potentially-dangerous URLs.
If you need to gain more control over untrusted contents, it is recommended that you
use an HTML sanitizer such as [bluemonday](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday).

Benchmark
--------------------
You can run this benchmark in the `_benchmark` directory.

### against other golang libraries

blackfriday v2 seems to be the fastest, but as it is not CommonMark compliant, its performance cannot be directly compared to that of the CommonMark-compliant libraries.

goldmark, meanwhile, builds a clean, extensible AST structure, achieves full compliance with
CommonMark, and consumes less memory, all while being reasonably fast.

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/10508/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/10508)

OpenTofu is an OSS tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. OpenTofu can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of OpenTofu are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: OpenTofu has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what OpenTofu will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when OpenTofu manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: OpenTofu builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, OpenTofu builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what OpenTofu will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

Karpenter is an open-source node provisioning project built for Kubernetes.
Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by:

* **Watching** for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable
* **Evaluating** scheduling constraints (resource requests, nodeselectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints) requested by the pods
* **Provisioning** nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
* **Removing** the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed

Come discuss Karpenter in the [#karpenter](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C02SFFZSA2K) channel, in the [Kubernetes slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) or join the [Karpenter working group](https://karpenter.sh/docs/contributing/working-group/) bi-weekly calls. If you want to contribute to the Karpenter project, please refer to the Karpenter docs.

Check out the [Docs](https://karpenter.sh/docs/) to learn more.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># uuid
The uuid package generates and inspects UUIDs based on
[RFC 9562](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562)
and DCE 1.1: Authentication and Security Services. 

This package is based on the github.com/pborman/uuid package (previously named
code.google.com/p/go-uuid).  It differs from these earlier packages in that
a UUID is a 16 byte array rather than a byte slice.  One loss due to this
change is the ability to represent an invalid UUID (vs a NIL UUID).

###### Install
```sh
go get github.com/google/uuid
```

###### Documentation 
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/google/uuid.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/uuid)

Full `go doc` style documentation for the package can be viewed online without
installing this package by using the GoDoc site here:

KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. KEDA serves
as a Kubernetes Metrics Server and allows users to define autoscaling rules using a dedicated Kubernetes custom
resource definition.

KEDA can run on both the cloud and the edge, integrates natively with Kubernetes components such as the Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler, and has no external dependencies.

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.

&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Vault Logo&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/f22d202cde2018f9455dec755118a9b84586e082/Vault_PrimaryLogo_Black.png&quot;&gt;

Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.

The key features of Vault are:

* **Secure Secret Storage**: Vault can store arbitrary key/value pairs. Vault encrypts data before writing it to persistent
  storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn&#039;t enough to access
  your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io),
  and more.

* **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some
  systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application
  needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault
  will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After
  creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them
  after the lease is up.

* **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing
  it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and
  developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without
  having to design their own encryption methods.

* **Leasing and Renewal**: Vault associates a **lease** with each secret.
  At the end of the lease, Vault automatically revokes the
  secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.

* **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault
  can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example,
  all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.
  Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the
  case of an intrusion.

Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams
-------------------------------

Documentation is available on the [Vault website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs).

If you&#039;re new to Vault and want to get started with security automation, please
check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/getting-started)
on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault)
to continue your learning.

For examples of how to interact with Vault from inside your application in different programming languages, see the [vault-examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-examples) repo. An out-of-the-box [sample application](https://github.com/hashicorp/hello-vault-go) is also available.

Show off your Vault knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the
[certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/#hashicorp-certified-vault-associate)
for information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/certification)
on HashiCorp&#039;s learning platform.

Developing Vault
--------------------

If you wish to work on Vault itself or any of its built-in systems, you&#039;ll
first need [Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.

For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a
[GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), then setting the 
[GOBIN](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables) variable to `$GOPATH/bin`. 
Ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your path as some distributions bundle the old version 
of build tools. 

Next, clone this repository. Vault uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules),
so it is recommended that you clone the repository ***outside*** of the GOPATH.
You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:

```sh
$ make bootstrap
...
```

To compile a development version of Vault, run `make` or `make dev`. This will
put the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make dev
...
$ bin/vault
...
```

To compile a development version of Vault with the UI, run `make static-dist dev-ui`. This will
put the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:

```sh
$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/vault
...
```

To run tests, type `make test`. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If
this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!

```sh
$ make test
...
```

If you&#039;re developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that
package by specifying the `TEST` variable. For example below, only
`vault` package tests will be run.

```sh
$ make test TEST=./vault
...
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like `could not read Username for &#039;https://github.com&#039;` you may need to adjust your git config like so:

```sh
$ git config --global --add url.&quot;git@github.com:&quot;.insteadOf &quot;https://github.com/&quot;
```


### Importing Vault

This repository publishes two libraries that may be imported by other projects:
`github.com/hashicorp/vault/api` and `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk`.

Note that this repository also contains Vault (the product), and as with most Go
projects, Vault uses Go modules to manage its dependencies. The mechanism to do
that is the [go.mod](./go.mod) file. As it happens, the presence of that file
also makes it theoretically possible to import Vault as a dependency into other
projects. Some other projects have made a practice of doing so in order to take
advantage of testing tooling that was developed for testing Vault itself. This
is not, and has never been, a supported way to use the Vault project. We aren&#039;t 
likely to fix bugs relating to failure to import `github.com/hashicorp/vault` 
into your project.

See also the section &quot;Docker-based tests&quot; below.

### Acceptance Tests

Vault has comprehensive [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)
covering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.

If you&#039;re working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to
verify it is functioning (and also hasn&#039;t broken anything else), we recommend
running the acceptance tests.

**Warning:** The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify *real resources*, which
may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically
possible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,
please run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least,
we recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend
you&#039;re testing.

To run the acceptance tests, invoke `make testacc`:

```sh
$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul
...
```

The `TEST` variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the
backend is. The `TESTARGS` variable is recommended to filter down to a specific
resource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very
long time.

Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for
things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell
you what to set, so it is not documented here.

For more information on Vault Enterprise features, visit the [Vault Enterprise site](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=github-vault-enterprise).

### Docker-based Tests

We have created an experimental new testing mechanism inspired by NewTestCluster.
An example of how to use it:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;hashicorp/vault&quot;, // or &quot;hashicorp/vault-enterprise&quot;
    ImageTag:    &quot;latest&quot;,
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
  
  client := cluster.Nodes()[0].APIClient()
  _, err := client.Logical().Read(&quot;sys/storage/raft/configuration&quot;)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Or for Enterprise:

```go
import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker&quot;
)

func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{
    ImageRepo: &quot;hashicorp/vault-enterprise&quot;,
    ImageTag:  &quot;latest&quot;,
	VaultLicense: licenseString, // not a path, the actual license bytes
  }
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

Here is a more realistic example of how we use it in practice.  DefaultOptions uses 
`hashicorp/vault`:`latest` as the repo and tag, but it also looks at the environment
variable VAULT_BINARY. If populated, it will copy the local file referenced by
VAULT_BINARY into the container. This is useful when testing local changes.

Instead of setting the VaultLicense option, you can set the VAULT_LICENSE_CI environment
variable, which is better than committing a license to version control.

Optionally you can set COMMIT_SHA, which will be appended to the image name we
build as a debugging convenience.

```go
func Test_Custom_Build_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)
  defer cluster.Cleanup()
}
```

There are a variety of helpers in the `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster`
package, e.g. these tests below will create a pair of 3-node clusters and link them using
PR or DR replication respectively, and fail if the replication state doesn&#039;t become healthy
before the passed context expires.

Again, as written, these depend on having a Vault Enterprise binary locally and the env
var VAULT_BINARY set to point to it, as well as having VAULT_LICENSE_CI set.

```go
func TestStandardPerfReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)
  if err != nil {
      t.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer r.Cleanup()

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
  defer cancel()
  err = r.StandardPerfReplication(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func TestStandardDRReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {
  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)
  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer r.Cleanup()

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
  defer cancel()
  err = r.StandardDRReplication(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

Finally, here&#039;s an example of running an existing OSS docker test with a custom binary:

```bash
$ GOOS=linux make dev
$ VAULT_BINARY=$(pwd)/bin/vault go test -run &#039;TestRaft_Configuration_Docker&#039; ./vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary
ok      github.com/hashicorp/vault/vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary        20.960s
```

# Ginkgo

Ginkgo is a mature testing framework for Go designed to help you write expressive specs.  Ginkgo builds on top of Go&#039;s `testing` foundation and is complemented by the [Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) matcher library.  Together, Ginkgo and Gomega let you express the intent behind your specs clearly:

```go
import (
    . &quot;github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2&quot;
    . &quot;github.com/onsi/gomega&quot;
    ...
)

var _ = Describe(&quot;Checking books out of the library&quot;, Label(&quot;library&quot;), func() {
    var library *libraries.Library
    var book *books.Book
    var valjean *users.User
    BeforeEach(func() {
        library = libraries.NewClient()
        book = &amp;books.Book{
            Title: &quot;Les Miserables&quot;,
            Author: &quot;Victor Hugo&quot;,
        }
        valjean = users.NewUser(&quot;Jean Valjean&quot;)
    })

    When(&quot;the library has the book in question&quot;, func() {
        BeforeEach(func(ctx SpecContext) {
            Expect(library.Store(ctx, book)).To(Succeed())
        })

        Context(&quot;and the book is available&quot;, func() {
            It(&quot;lends it to the reader&quot;, func(ctx SpecContext) {
                Expect(valjean.Checkout(ctx, library, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;)).To(Succeed())
                Expect(valjean.Books()).To(ContainElement(book))
                Expect(library.UserWithBook(ctx, book)).To(Equal(valjean))
            }, SpecTimeout(time.Second * 5))
        })

        Context(&quot;but the book has already been checked out&quot;, func() {
            var javert *users.User
            BeforeEach(func(ctx SpecContext) {
                javert = users.NewUser(&quot;Javert&quot;)
                Expect(javert.Checkout(ctx, library, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;)).To(Succeed())
            })

            It(&quot;tells the user&quot;, func(ctx SpecContext) {
                err := valjean.Checkout(ctx, library, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;)
                Expect(err).To(MatchError(&quot;Les Miserables is currently checked out&quot;))
            }, SpecTimeout(time.Second * 5))

            It(&quot;lets the user place a hold and get notified later&quot;, func(ctx SpecContext) {
                Expect(valjean.Hold(ctx, library, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;)).To(Succeed())
                Expect(valjean.Holds(ctx)).To(ContainElement(book))

                By(&quot;when Javert returns the book&quot;)
                Expect(javert.Return(ctx, library, book)).To(Succeed())

                By(&quot;it eventually informs Valjean&quot;)
                notification := &quot;Les Miserables is ready for pick up&quot;
                Eventually(ctx, valjean.Notifications).Should(ContainElement(notification))

                Expect(valjean.Checkout(ctx, library, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;)).To(Succeed())
                Expect(valjean.Books(ctx)).To(ContainElement(book))
                Expect(valjean.Holds(ctx)).To(BeEmpty())
            }, SpecTimeout(time.Second * 10))
        })  
    })

    When(&quot;the library does not have the book in question&quot;, func() {
        It(&quot;tells the reader the book is unavailable&quot;, func(ctx SpecContext) {
            err := valjean.Checkout(ctx, library, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;)
            Expect(err).To(MatchError(&quot;Les Miserables is not in the library catalog&quot;))
        }, SpecTimeout(time.Second * 5))
    })
})
```

Jump to the [docs](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) to learn more.  It&#039;s easy to [bootstrap](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#bootstrapping-a-suite) and start writing your [first specs](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#adding-specs-to-a-suite).

If you have a question, comment, bug report, feature request, etc. please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo/issues/new), or visit the [Ginkgo Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T029RQSE6/CQQ50BBNW).

## Capabilities

Whether writing basic unit specs, complex integration specs, or even performance specs - Ginkgo gives you an expressive Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that will be familiar to users coming from frameworks such as [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick), [RSpec](https://rspec.info), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io), and [Busted](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/).  This style of testing is sometimes referred to as &quot;Behavior-Driven Development&quot; (BDD) though Ginkgo&#039;s utility extends beyond acceptance-level testing.

With Ginkgo&#039;s DSL you can use nestable [`Describe`, `Context` and `When` container nodes](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#organizing-specs-with-container-nodes) to help you organize your specs.  [`BeforeEach` and `AfterEach` setup nodes](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#extracting-common-setup-beforeeach) for setup and cleanup.  [`It` and `Specify` subject nodes](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#spec-subjects-it) that hold your assertions. [`BeforeSuite` and `AfterSuite` nodes](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#suite-setup-and-cleanup-beforesuite-and-aftersuite) to prep for and cleanup after a suite... and [much more!](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#writing-specs).

At runtime, Ginkgo can run your specs in reproducibly [random order](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#spec-randomization) and has sophisticated support for [spec parallelization](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#spec-parallelization).  In fact, running specs in parallel is as easy as

```bash
ginkgo -p
```

By following [established patterns for writing parallel specs](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#patterns-for-parallel-integration-specs) you can build even large, complex integration suites that parallelize cleanly and run performantly.  And you don&#039;t have to worry about your spec suite hanging or leaving a mess behind - Ginkgo provides a per-node `context.Context` and the capability to interrupt the spec after a set period of time - and then clean up.

As your suites grow Ginkgo helps you keep your specs organized with [labels](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#spec-labels) and lets you easily run [subsets of specs](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#filtering-specs), either [programmatically](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#focused-specs) or on the [command line](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#combining-filters).  And Ginkgo&#039;s reporting infrastructure generates machine-readable output in a [variety of formats](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#generating-machine-readable-reports) _and_ allows you to build your own [custom reporting infrastructure](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#generating-reports-programmatically).

Ginkgo ships with `ginkgo`, a [command line tool](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#ginkgo-cli-overview) with support for generating, running, filtering, and profiling Ginkgo suites.  You can even have Ginkgo automatically run your specs when it detects a change with `ginkgo watch`, enabling rapid feedback loops during test-driven development.

And that&#039;s just Ginkgo!  [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) brings a rich, mature, family of [assertions and matchers](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/#provided-matchers) to your suites.  With Gomega you can easily mix [synchronous and asynchronous assertions](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#patterns-for-asynchronous-testing) in your specs.  You can even build your own set of expressive domain-specific matchers quickly and easily by composing Gomega&#039;s [existing building blocks](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#building-custom-matchers).

Happy Testing!

## What is CockroachDB?

CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and
strongly-consistent key-value store. It **scales** horizontally;
**survives** disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with
minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention; supports
**strongly-consistent** ACID transactions; and provides a familiar
**SQL** API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.

For more details, see our [FAQ](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/frequently-asked-questions.html) or [architecture document](
https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/overview.html).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TypeScript 7

[Not sure what this is? Read the announcement post!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)

This repo is very much under active development; as such there are no published artifacts at this time.
Interested developers can clone and run locally to try out things as they become available.

## How to Build and Run

This repo uses [Go 1.24 or higher](https://go.dev/dl/), [Rust 1.85 or higher](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/), and [`hereby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hereby).

For tests and code generation, this repo contains a git submodule to the main TypeScript repo pointing to the commit being ported.
When cloning, you&#039;ll want to clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go.git
```

If you have already cloned the repo, you can initialize the submodule with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

With the submodule in place and `npm ci`, you can run tasks via `hereby`, similar to the TypeScript repo:

```sh
hereby build          # Verify that the project builds
hereby test           # Run all tests
hereby install-tools  # Install additional tools such as linters
hereby lint           # Run all linters
hereby format         # Format all code
hereby generate       # Generate all Go code (e.g. diagnostics, committed to repo)
```

Additional tasks are a work in progress.

`hereby` is not required to work on the repo; the regular `go` tooling (e.g., `go build`, `go test ./...`) will work as expected.
`hereby` tasks are provided as a convenience for those familiar with the TypeScript repo.

### Running `tsgo`

After running `hereby build`, you can run `built/local/tsgo`, which behaves mostly the same as `tsc`.

### Running LSP Prototype

* Run `hereby build` to build the LSP server
* Run `hereby install-extension` to build and install the VS Code extension. (Use `--insiders` to target `code-insiders` instead of `code`.)
* Copy the `&quot;typescript-go.executablePath&quot;` setting printed by `hereby install-extension` to your VS Code settings.
* Select &quot;TypeScript: Use TypeScript Go (Experimental)&quot; from the VS Code command palette (or set `&quot;typescript.experimental.useTsgo&quot;` in your VS Code settings).

Alternatively, to debug and run the VS Code extension without installing it globally:

* Run VS Code in the repo workspace (`code .`)
* Copy `.vscode/launch.template.json` to `.vscode/launch.json`
* &lt;kbd&gt;F5&lt;/kbd&gt; (or `Debug: Start Debugging` from the command palette)

This will launch a new VS Code instance which uses the Corsa LS as the backend. If correctly set up, you should see &quot;tsgo&quot; in the status bar when a TypeScript or JavaScript file is open:

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Entry point slightly different for now |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS5.8 |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently (in progress) |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JS Doc | not ready | - |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | not ready | Coming soon |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking |
| Build mode / project references | not ready | - |
| Incremental build | not ready | - |
| Language service (LSP) | prototype | Minimal functionality (errors, hover, go to def). More features coming soon |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka &quot;believed done&quot;: We&#039;re not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven&#039;t even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn&#039;t bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

- Find and use [popular software packaged as Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) to run in Kubernetes
- Share your own applications as Helm Charts
- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
- Manage releases of Helm packages

## Helm in a Handbasket

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Helm Development and Stable Versions

Helm v4 is currently under development on the `main` branch. This is unstable and the APIs within the Go SDK and at the command line are changing.
Helm v3 (current stable) is maintained on the `dev-v3` branch. APIs there follow semantic versioning.

## Install

Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest).

Unpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!

If you want to use a package manager:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install helm`.
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) users can use `choco install kubernetes-helm`.
- [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) users can use `winget install Helm.Helm`.
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) users can use `scoop install helm`.
- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) users can use `snap install helm --classic`.
- [Flox](https://flox.dev) users can use `flox install kubernetes-helm`.

To rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the [Quick Start Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/).

See the [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more options,
including installing pre-releases.

## Docs

Get started with the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://helm.sh/docs)

## Roadmap

The [Helm roadmap uses GitHub milestones](https://github.com/helm/helm/milestones) to track the progress of the project.

The development of Helm v4 is currently happening on the `main` branch while the development of Helm v3, the stable branch, is happening on the `dev-v3` branch. Changes should be made to the `main` branch prior to being added to the `dev-v3` branch so that all changes are carried along to Helm v4.
