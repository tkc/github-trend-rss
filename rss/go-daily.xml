**JuiceFS** is a high-performance [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) file system released under Apache License 2.0, particularly designed for the cloud-native environment. The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in Object Storage _(e.g. Amazon S3)_, and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various compatible database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and TiKV based on the scenarios and requirements.

With JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage.

📖 **Document**: [Quick Start Guide](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/quick_start_guide)

## Architecture

JuiceFS consists of three parts:

1. **JuiceFS Client**: Coordinates Object Storage and metadata storage engine as well as implementation of file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway.
2. **Data Storage**: Stores data, with supports of a variety of data storage media, e.g., local disk, public or private cloud Object Storage, and HDFS.
3. **Metadata Engine**: Stores the corresponding metadata that contains information of file name, file size, permission group, creation and modification time and directory structure, etc., with supports of different metadata engines, e.g., Redis, MySQL, SQLite and TiKV.

![JuiceFS Architecture](docs/en/images/juicefs-arch-new.png)

JuiceFS can store the metadata of file system on different metadata engines, like Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in Object Storage through JuiceFS client. [Learn more](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/architecture)

![data-structure-diagram](docs/en/images/data-structure-diagram.svg)

Each file stored in JuiceFS is split into **&quot;Chunk&quot;** s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more **&quot;Slice&quot;**(s), and the length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice is composed of size-fixed **&quot;Block&quot;** s, which are 4 MiB by default. These blocks will be stored in Object Storage in the end; at the same time, the metadata information of the file and its Chunks, Slices, and Blocks will be stored in metadata engines via JuiceFS. [Learn more](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/architecture/#how-juicefs-store-files)

![How JuiceFS stores your files](docs/en/images/how-juicefs-stores-files.svg)

When using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in Object Storage. Therefore, the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the Object Storage platform; instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. Don&#039;t panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS!

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. One supported metadata engine, see [How to Set Up Metadata Engine](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/databases_for_metadata)
2. One supported Object Storage for storing data blocks, see [Supported Object Storage](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_setup_object_storage)
3. [JuiceFS Client](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/installation) downloaded and installed

Please refer to [Quick Start Guide](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/quick_start_guide) to start using JuiceFS right away!

## POSIX Compatibility

JuiceFS has passed all of the compatibility tests (8813 in total) in the latest [pjdfstest](https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest) .

```
All tests successful.

Test Summary Report
-------------------
/root/soft/pjdfstest/tests/chown/00.t          (Wstat: 0 Tests: 1323 Failed: 0)
  TODO passed:   693, 697, 708-709, 714-715, 729, 733
Files=235, Tests=8813, 233 wallclock secs ( 2.77 usr  0.38 sys +  2.57 cusr  3.93 csys =  9.65 CPU)
Result: PASS
```

Aside from the POSIX features covered by pjdfstest, JuiceFS also provides:

- **Close-to-open consistency**. Once a file is written _and_ closed, it is guaranteed to view the written data in the following opens and reads from any client. Within the same mount point, all the written data can be read immediately.
- Rename and all other metadata operations are atomic, which are guaranteed by supported metadata engine transaction.
- Opened files remain accessible after unlink from same mount point.
- Mmap (tested with FSx).
- Fallocate with punch hole support.
- Extended attributes (xattr).
- BSD locks (flock).
- POSIX record locks (fcntl).

## Performance Benchmark

### Basic benchmark

JuiceFS provides a subcommand that can run a few basic benchmarks to help you understand how it works in your environment:

![JuiceFS Bench](docs/en/images/juicefs-bench.png)

### Throughput

A sequential read/write benchmark has also been performed on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [fio](https://github.com/axboe/fio).

![Sequential Read Write Benchmark](docs/en/images/sequential-read-write-benchmark.svg)

Above result figure shows that JuiceFS can provide 10X more throughput than the other two (see [more details](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/fio)).

### Metadata IOPS

A simple mdtest benchmark has been performed on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [mdtest](https://github.com/hpc/ior).

![Metadata Benchmark](docs/en/images/metadata-benchmark.svg)

The result shows that JuiceFS can provide significantly more metadata IOPS than the other two (see [more details](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/mdtest)).

## FAQ

### Why doesn&#039;t JuiceFS support XXX Object Storage?

JuiceFS supports many Object Storage services. Please check out [this list](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_setup_object_storage#supported-object-storage) first. If the Object Storage you want to use is compatible with S3, you could treat it as S3. Otherwise, try reporting any issue.

### Can I use Redis Cluster as metadata engine?

Yes. Since [v1.0.0 Beta3](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3) JuiceFS supports the use of [Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/docs/manual/scaling) as the metadata engine, but it should be noted that Redis Cluster requires that the keys of all operations in a transaction must be in the same hash slot, so a JuiceFS file system can only use one hash slot.

See [&quot;Redis Best Practices&quot;](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/redis_best_practices) for more information.

### What&#039;s the difference between JuiceFS and XXX?

See [&quot;Comparison with Others&quot;](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/comparison/juicefs_vs_alluxio) for more information.

For more FAQs, please see the [full list](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/faq).

The fun, functional and stateful way to build terminal apps. A Go framework
based on [The Elm Architecture][elm]. Bubble Tea is well-suited for simple and
complex terminal applications, either inline, full-window, or a mix of both.

Bubble Tea is in use in production and includes a number of features and
performance optimizations we’ve added along the way. Among those is
a framerate-based renderer, mouse support, focus reporting and more.

## Tutorial

Bubble Tea is based on the functional design paradigms of [The Elm
Architecture][elm], which happens to work nicely with Go. It&#039;s a delightful way
to build applications.

This tutorial assumes you have a working knowledge of Go.

By the way, the non-annotated source code for this program is available
[on GitHub][tut-source].

[elm]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/
[tut-source]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/main/tutorials/basics

### Enough! Let&#039;s get to it.

For this tutorial, we&#039;re making a shopping list.

To start we&#039;ll define our package and import some libraries. Our only external
import will be the Bubble Tea library, which we&#039;ll call `tea` for short.

```go
package main

// These imports will be used later on the tutorial. If you save the file
// now, Go might complain they are unused, but that&#039;s fine.
// You may also need to run `go mod tidy` to download bubbletea and its
// dependencies.
import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;os&quot;

    tea &quot;github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea&quot;
)
```

Bubble Tea programs are comprised of a **model** that describes the application
state and three simple methods on that model:

- **Init**, a function that returns an initial command for the application to run.
- **Update**, a function that handles incoming events and updates the model accordingly.
- **View**, a function that renders the UI based on the data in the model.

### The Model

So let&#039;s start by defining our model which will store our application&#039;s state.
It can be any type, but a `struct` usually makes the most sense.

```go
type model struct {
    choices  []string           // items on the to-do list
    cursor   int                // which to-do list item our cursor is pointing at
    selected map[int]struct{}   // which to-do items are selected
}
```

### Initialization

Next, we’ll define our application’s initial state. In this case, we’re defining
a function to return our initial model, however, we could just as easily define
the initial model as a variable elsewhere, too.

```go
func initialModel() model {
	return model{
		// Our to-do list is a grocery list
		choices:  []string{&quot;Buy carrots&quot;, &quot;Buy celery&quot;, &quot;Buy kohlrabi&quot;},

		// A map which indicates which choices are selected. We&#039;re using
		// the  map like a mathematical set. The keys refer to the indexes
		// of the `choices` slice, above.
		selected: make(map[int]struct{}),
	}
}
```

Next, we define the `Init` method. `Init` can return a `Cmd` that could perform
some initial I/O. For now, we don&#039;t need to do any I/O, so for the command,
we&#039;ll just return `nil`, which translates to &quot;no command.&quot;

```go
func (m model) Init() tea.Cmd {
    // Just return `nil`, which means &quot;no I/O right now, please.&quot;
    return nil
}
```

### The Update Method

Next up is the update method. The update function is called when ”things
happen.” Its job is to look at what has happened and return an updated model in
response. It can also return a `Cmd` to make more things happen, but for now
don&#039;t worry about that part.

In our case, when a user presses the down arrow, `Update`’s job is to notice
that the down arrow was pressed and move the cursor accordingly (or not).

The “something happened” comes in the form of a `Msg`, which can be any type.
Messages are the result of some I/O that took place, such as a keypress, timer
tick, or a response from a server.

We usually figure out which type of `Msg` we received with a type switch, but
you could also use a type assertion.

For now, we&#039;ll just deal with `tea.KeyMsg` messages, which are automatically
sent to the update function when keys are pressed.

```go
func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    switch msg := msg.(type) {

    // Is it a key press?
    case tea.KeyMsg:

        // Cool, what was the actual key pressed?
        switch msg.String() {

        // These keys should exit the program.
        case &quot;ctrl+c&quot;, &quot;q&quot;:
            return m, tea.Quit

        // The &quot;up&quot; and &quot;k&quot; keys move the cursor up
        case &quot;up&quot;, &quot;k&quot;:
            if m.cursor &gt; 0 {
                m.cursor--
            }

        // The &quot;down&quot; and &quot;j&quot; keys move the cursor down
        case &quot;down&quot;, &quot;j&quot;:
            if m.cursor &lt; len(m.choices)-1 {
                m.cursor++
            }

        // The &quot;enter&quot; key and the spacebar (a literal space) toggle
        // the selected state for the item that the cursor is pointing at.
        case &quot;enter&quot;, &quot; &quot;:
            _, ok := m.selected[m.cursor]
            if ok {
                delete(m.selected, m.cursor)
            } else {
                m.selected[m.cursor] = struct{}{}
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the updated model to the Bubble Tea runtime for processing.
    // Note that we&#039;re not returning a command.
    return m, nil
}
```

You may have noticed that &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl+c&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;q&lt;/kbd&gt; above return
a `tea.Quit` command with the model. That’s a special command which instructs
the Bubble Tea runtime to quit, exiting the program.

### The View Method

At last, it’s time to render our UI. Of all the methods, the view is the
simplest. We look at the model in its current state and use it to return
a `string`. That string is our UI!

Because the view describes the entire UI of your application, you don’t have to
worry about redrawing logic and stuff like that. Bubble Tea takes care of it
for you.

```go
func (m model) View() string {
    // The header
    s := &quot;What should we buy at the market?\n\n&quot;

    // Iterate over our choices
    for i, choice := range m.choices {

        // Is the cursor pointing at this choice?
        cursor := &quot; &quot; // no cursor
        if m.cursor == i {
            cursor = &quot;&gt;&quot; // cursor!
        }

        // Is this choice selected?
        checked := &quot; &quot; // not selected
        if _, ok := m.selected[i]; ok {
            checked = &quot;x&quot; // selected!
        }

        // Render the row
        s += fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%s [%s] %s\n&quot;, cursor, checked, choice)
    }

    // The footer
    s += &quot;\nPress q to quit.\n&quot;

    // Send the UI for rendering
    return s
}
```

### All Together Now

The last step is to simply run our program. We pass our initial model to
`tea.NewProgram` and let it rip:

```go
func main() {
    p := tea.NewProgram(initialModel())
    if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf(&quot;Alas, there&#039;s been an error: %v&quot;, err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

## What’s Next?

This tutorial covers the basics of building an interactive terminal UI, but
in the real world you&#039;ll also need to perform I/O. To learn about that have a
look at the [Command Tutorial][cmd]. It&#039;s pretty simple.

There are also several [Bubble Tea examples][examples] available and, of course,
there are [Go Docs][docs].

[cmd]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/main/tutorials/commands/
[examples]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/main/examples
[docs]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea?tab=doc

## Debugging

### Debugging with Delve

Since Bubble Tea apps assume control of stdin and stdout, you’ll need to run
delve in headless mode and then connect to it:

```bash
# Start the debugger
$ dlv debug --headless --api-version=2 --listen=127.0.0.1:43000 .
API server listening at: 127.0.0.1:43000

# Connect to it from another terminal
$ dlv connect 127.0.0.1:43000
```

If you do not explicitly supply the `--listen` flag, the port used will vary
per run, so passing this in makes the debugger easier to use from a script
or your IDE of choice.

Additionally, we pass in `--api-version=2` because delve defaults to version 1
for backwards compatibility reasons. However, delve recommends using version 2
for all new development and some clients may no longer work with version 1.
For more information, see the [Delve documentation](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/api).

### Logging Stuff

You can’t really log to stdout with Bubble Tea because your TUI is busy
occupying that! You can, however, log to a file by including something like
the following prior to starting your Bubble Tea program:

```go
if len(os.Getenv(&quot;DEBUG&quot;)) &gt; 0 {
	f, err := tea.LogToFile(&quot;debug.log&quot;, &quot;debug&quot;)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(&quot;fatal:&quot;, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer f.Close()
}
```

To see what’s being logged in real time, run `tail -f debug.log` while you run
your program in another window.

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

etcd is used [in production by many companies](./ADOPTERS.md), and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as [Kubernetes][k8s], [locksmith][], [vulcand][], [Doorman][], and many others. Reliability is further ensured by rigorous [**robustness testing**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness).

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.

## Maintainers

[Maintainers](OWNERS) strive to shape an inclusive open source project culture where users are heard and contributors feel respected and empowered. Maintainers aim to build productive relationships across different companies and disciplines. Read more about [Maintainers role and responsibilities](Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md#maintainers).

## Getting started

### Getting etcd

The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker on the [release page][github-release].

For more installation guides, please check out [play.etcd.io](http://play.etcd.io) and [operating etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide).

[github-release]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases

### Running etcd

First start a single-member cluster of etcd.

If etcd is installed using the [pre-built release binaries][github-release], run it from the installation location as below:

```bash
/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd
```

The etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:

```bash
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/
etcd
```

This will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.

Next, let&#039;s set a single key, and then retrieve it:

```bash
etcdctl put mykey &quot;this is awesome&quot;
etcdctl get mykey
```

etcd is now running and serving client requests. For more, please check out:

* [Interactive etcd playground](http://play.etcd.io)
* [Animated quick demo](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/demo)

### etcd TCP ports

The [official etcd ports][iana-ports] are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.

[iana-ports]: http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

### Running a local etcd cluster

First install [goreman](https://github.com/mattn/goreman), which manages Procfile-based applications.

Our [Procfile script](./Procfile) will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:

```bash
goreman start
```

This will bring up 3 etcd members `infra1`, `infra2` and `infra3` and optionally etcd `grpc-proxy`, which runs locally and composes a cluster.

Every cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.

Follow the comments in [Procfile script](./Procfile) to add a learner node to the cluster.

### Install etcd client v3

```bash
go get go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3
```

### Next steps

Now it&#039;s time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.

* Read the full [documentation].
* Review etcd [frequently asked questions].
* Explore the full gRPC [API].
* Set up a [multi-machine cluster][clustering].
* Learn the [config format, env variables and flags][configuration].
* Find [language bindings and tools][integrations].
* Use TLS to [secure an etcd cluster][security].
* [Tune etcd][tuning].

### Community meetings

etcd contributors and maintainers meet every week at `11:00` AM (USA Pacific) on Thursday and meetings alternate between community meetings and issue triage meetings. Meeting agendas are recorded in a [shared Google doc][shared-meeting-notes] and everyone is welcome to suggest additional topics or other agendas.

Issue triage meetings are aimed at getting through our backlog of PRs and Issues. Triage meetings are open to any contributor; you don&#039;t have to be a reviewer or approver to help out! They can also be a good way to get started contributing.

The meeting lead role is rotated for each meeting between etcd maintainers or sig-etcd leads and is recorded in a [shared Google sheet][shared-rotation-sheet].

Meeting recordings are uploaded to the official etcd [YouTube channel].

- `--pubipv6 PUBIPV6`, `-6 PUBIPV6` - set public IPv6 addr
- `--searchwa`, `-s` - allow search without authentication
- `--maxsize MAXSIZE`, `-m MAXSIZE` - max allowed stream size (in Bytes)
- `--tg TGTOKEN`, `-T TGTOKEN` - telegram bot token
- `--fuse FUSEPATH`, `-f FUSEPATH` - fuse mount path
- `--webdav` - enable web dav
- `--help`, `-h` - display this help and exit
- `--version` - display version and exit

Example:

```bash
TorrServer-darwin-arm64 [--port PORT] [--ip IP] [--path PATH] [--logpath LOGPATH] [--weblogpath WEBLOGPATH] [--rdb] [--httpauth] [--dontkill] [--ui] [--torrentsdir TORRENTSDIR] [--torrentaddr TORRENTADDR] [--pubipv4 PUBIPV4] [--pubipv6 PUBIPV6] [--searchwa] [--maxsize MAXSIZE] [--tg TGTOKEN] [--fuse FUSEPATH] [--webdav]
```

### Running in Docker &amp; Docker Compose

Run in console

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name torrserver -p 8090:8090 ghcr.io/yourok/torrserver:latest
```

For running in persistence mode, just mount volume to container by adding `-v ~/ts:/opt/ts`, where `~/ts` folder path is just example, but you could use it anyway... Result example command:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name torrserver -v ~/ts:/opt/ts -p 8090:8090 ghcr.io/yourok/torrserver:latest
```

#### Environments

- `TS_HTTPAUTH` - 1, and place auth file into `~/ts/config` folder for enabling basic auth
- `TS_RDB` - if 1, then the enabling `--rdb` flag
- `TS_DONTKILL` - if 1, then the enabling `--dontkill` flag
- `TS_PORT` - for changind default port to **5555** (example), also u need to change `-p 8090:8090` to `-p 5555:5555` (example)
- `TS_CONF_PATH` - for overriding torrserver config path inside container. Example `/opt/tsss`
- `TS_TORR_DIR` - for overriding torrents directory. Example `/opt/torr_files`
- `TS_LOG_PATH` - for overriding log path. Example `/opt/torrserver.log`

Example with full overrided command (on default values):

```bash
docker run --rm -d -e TS_PORT=5665 -e TS_DONTKILL=1 -e TS_HTTPAUTH=1 -e TS_RDB=1 -e TS_CONF_PATH=/opt/ts/config -e TS_LOG_PATH=/opt/ts/log -e TS_TORR_DIR=/opt/ts/torrents --name torrserver -v ~/ts:/opt/ts -p 5665:5665 ghcr.io/yourok/torrserver:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

```yml
# docker-compose.yml

version: &#039;3.3&#039;
services:
    torrserver:
        image: ghcr.io/yourok/torrserver
        container_name: torrserver
        network_mode: host    # to allow DLNA feature
        environment:
            - TS_PORT=5665
            - TS_DONTKILL=1
            - TS_HTTPAUTH=0
            - TS_CONF_PATH=/opt/ts/config
            - TS_TORR_DIR=/opt/ts/torrents
        volumes:
            - &#039;./CACHE:/opt/ts/torrents&#039;
            - &#039;./CONFIG:/opt/ts/config&#039;
        ports:
            - &#039;5665:5665&#039;
        restart: unless-stopped
        

```

### Smart TV (using Media Station X)

1. Install **Media Station X** on your Smart TV (see [platform support](https://msx.benzac.de/info/?tab=PlatformSupport))

2. Open it and go to: **Settings -&gt; Start Parameter -&gt; Setup**

3. Enter current ip and port of the TorrServe(r), e.g. `127.0.0.1:8090`

## Development

### Go server

To run the Go server locally, just run

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd
```

### Web development

To run the web server locally, just run

```bash
yarn start
```

More info at &lt;https://github.com/YouROK/TorrServer/tree/master/web#readme&gt;

### Build

#### Server

- Install [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.20+
- Go to the TorrServer source directory
- Run build script under linux or macOS `build-all.sh`

#### Web

- Install **npm** and **yarn**
- Go to the web directory
- Run `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider yarn build`

#### Android

To build an Android server you will need the Android Toolchain.

#### Swagger

`swag` must be installed on the system to [re]build Swagger documentation.

```bash
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
cd server; swag init -g web/server.go

# Documentation can be linted using
swag fmt
```

## API

### API Docs

API documentation is hosted as Swagger format available at path `/swagger/index.html`.

## Authentication

The users data file should be located near to the settings. Basic auth, read more in wiki &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication&gt;.

`accs.db` in JSON format:

```json
{
    &quot;User1&quot;: &quot;Pass1&quot;,
    &quot;User2&quot;: &quot;Pass2&quot;
}
```

Note: You should enable authentication with -a (--httpauth) TorrServer startup option.

## Whitelist/Blacklist IP

The lists file should be located in the same directory with config.db.

- Whitelist file name: `wip.txt`
- Blacklist file name: `bip.txt`

Whitelist has priority over everything else.

Example:

```text
local:127.0.0.0-127.0.0.255
127.0.0.0-127.0.0.255
local:127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1
# at the beginning of the line, comment
```

# Quick Start #

## Quick Start for S3 API on Docker ##

`docker run -p 8333:8333 chrislusf/seaweedfs server -s3`

## Quick Start with Single Binary ##
* Download the latest binary from https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/releases and unzip a single binary file `weed` or `weed.exe`. Or run `go install github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed@latest`.
* `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin ; export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=key` as the admin credentials to access the object store.
* Run `weed server -dir=/some/data/dir -s3` to start one master, one volume server, one filer, and one S3 gateway.

Also, to increase capacity, just add more volume servers by running `weed volume -dir=&quot;/some/data/dir2&quot; -master=&quot;&lt;master_host&gt;:9333&quot; -port=8081` locally, or on a different machine, or on thousands of machines. That is it!

## Quick Start SeaweedFS S3 on AWS ##
* Setup fast production-ready [SeaweedFS S3 on AWS with cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nzelz5gprlrjc)

# Introduction #

SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

1. to store billions of files!
2. to serve the files fast!

SeaweedFS started as an Object Store to handle small files efficiently. 
Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, 
the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, 
and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. 
This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, 
allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation).

There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file&#039;s metadata. 
It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases.

SeaweedFS started by implementing [Facebook&#039;s Haystack design paper](http://www.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf). 
Also, SeaweedFS implements erasure coding with ideas from 
[f4: Facebook’s Warm BLOB Storage System](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-muralidhar.pdf), and has a lot of similarities with [Facebook’s Tectonic Filesystem](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast21-pan.pdf)

On top of the object store, optional [Filer] can support directories and POSIX attributes. 
Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, 
e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc.

For any distributed key value stores, the large values can be offloaded to SeaweedFS. 
With the fast access speed and linearly scalable capacity, 
SeaweedFS can work as a distributed [Key-Large-Value store][KeyLargeValueStore].

SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud. 
With hot data on local cluster, and warm data on the cloud with O(1) access time, 
SeaweedFS can achieve both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity.
What&#039;s more, the cloud storage access API cost is minimized. 
Faster and cheaper than direct cloud storage!

## Example: Using Seaweed Object Store ##

By default, the master node runs on port 9333, and the volume nodes run on port 8080.
Let&#039;s start one master node, and two volume nodes on port 8080 and 8081. Ideally, they should be started from different machines. We&#039;ll use localhost as an example.

SeaweedFS uses HTTP REST operations to read, write, and delete. The responses are in JSON or JSONP format.

### Start Master Server ###

```
&gt; ./weed master
```

### Start Volume Servers ###

```
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data1&quot; -max=5  -master=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8080 &amp;
&gt; weed volume -dir=&quot;/tmp/data2&quot; -max=10 -master=&quot;localhost:9333&quot; -port=8081 &amp;
```

### Write File ###

To upload a file: first, send a HTTP POST, PUT, or GET request to `/dir/assign` to get an `fid` and a volume server URL:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign
{&quot;count&quot;:1,&quot;fid&quot;:&quot;3,01637037d6&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;,&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}
```

Second, to store the file content, send a HTTP multi-part POST request to `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` from the response:

```
&gt; curl -F file=@/home/chris/myphoto.jpg http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;myphoto.jpg&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:43234,&quot;eTag&quot;:&quot;1cc0118e&quot;}
```

To update, send another POST request with updated file content.

For deletion, send an HTTP DELETE request to the same `url + &#039;/&#039; + fid` URL:

```
&gt; curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6
```

### Save File Id ###

Now, you can save the `fid`, 3,01637037d6 in this case, to a database field.

The number 3 at the start represents a volume id. After the comma, it&#039;s one file key, 01, and a file cookie, 637037d6.

The volume id is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The file key is an unsigned 64-bit integer. The file cookie is an unsigned 32-bit integer, used to prevent URL guessing.

The file key and file cookie are both coded in hex. You can store the &lt;volume id, file key, file cookie&gt; tuple in your own format, or simply store the `fid` as a string.

If stored as a string, in theory, you would need 8+1+16+8=33 bytes. A char(33) would be enough, if not more than enough, since most uses will not need 2^32 volumes.

If space is really a concern, you can store the file id in your own format. You would need one 4-byte integer for volume id, 8-byte long number for file key, and a 4-byte integer for the file cookie. So 16 bytes are more than enough.

### Read File ###

Here is an example of how to render the URL.

First look up the volume server&#039;s URLs by the file&#039;s volumeId:

```
&gt; curl http://localhost:9333/dir/lookup?volumeId=3
{&quot;volumeId&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;publicUrl&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;localhost:8080&quot;}]}
```

Since (usually) there are not too many volume servers, and volumes don&#039;t move often, you can cache the results most of the time. Depending on the replication type, one volume can have multiple replica locations. Just randomly pick one location to read.

Now you can take the public URL, render the URL or directly read from the volume server via URL:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
```

Notice we add a file extension &quot;.jpg&quot; here. It&#039;s optional and just one way for the client to specify the file content type.

If you want a nicer URL, you can use one of these alternative URL formats:

```
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6/my_preferred_name.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg
 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6
 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6
```

If you want to get a scaled version of an image, you can add some params:

```
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fit
http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&amp;width=200&amp;mode=fill
```

### Rack-Aware and Data Center-Aware Replication ###

SeaweedFS applies the replication strategy at a volume level. So, when you are getting a file id, you can specify the replication strategy. For example:

```
curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?replication=001
```

The replication parameter options are:

```
000: no replication
001: replicate once on the same rack
010: replicate once on a different rack, but same data center
100: replicate once on a different data center
200: replicate twice on two different data center
110: replicate once on a different rack, and once on a different data center
```

More details about replication can be found [on the wiki][Replication].

[Replication]: https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Replication

You can also set the default replication strategy when starting the master server.

### Allocate File Key on Specific Data Center ###

Volume servers can be started with a specific data center name:

```
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/1 -port=8080 -dataCenter=dc1
 weed volume -dir=/tmp/2 -port=8081 -dataCenter=dc2
```

When requesting a file key, an optional &quot;dataCenter&quot; parameter can limit the assigned volume to the specific data center. For example, this specifies that the assigned volume should be limited to &#039;dc1&#039;:

```
 http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?dataCenter=dc1
```

## Object Store Architecture ##

Usually distributed file systems split each file into chunks, a central master keeps a mapping of filenames, chunk indices to chunk handles, and also which chunks each chunk server has.

The main drawback is that the central master can&#039;t handle many small files efficiently, and since all read requests need to go through the chunk master, so it might not scale well for many concurrent users.

Instead of managing chunks, SeaweedFS manages data volumes in the master server. Each data volume is 32GB in size, and can hold a lot of files. And each storage node can have many data volumes. So the master node only needs to store the metadata about the volumes, which is a fairly small amount of data and is generally stable.

The actual file metadata is stored in each volume on volume servers. Since each volume server only manages metadata of files on its own disk, with only 16 bytes for each file, all file access can read file metadata just from memory and only needs one disk operation to actually read file data.

For comparison, consider that an xfs inode structure in Linux is 536 bytes.

### Master Server and Volume Server ###

The architecture is fairly simple. The actual data is stored in volumes on storage nodes. One volume server can have multiple volumes, and can both support read and write access with basic authentication.

All volumes are managed by a master server. The master server contains the volume id to volume server mapping. This is fairly static information, and can be easily cached.

On each write request, the master server also generates a file key, which is a growing 64-bit unsigned integer. Since write requests are not generally as frequent as read requests, one master server should be able to handle the concurrency well.

### Write and Read files ###

When a client sends a write request, the master server returns (volume id, file key, file cookie, volume node URL) for the file. The client then contacts the volume node and POSTs the file content.

When a client needs to read a file based on (volume id, file key, file cookie), it asks the master server by the volume id for the

**小红书基础运营知识**

- **标题：（非常重要）小红书要求标题不超过 20 个字**
- **正文：（非常重要）：正文不能超过 1000 个字**
- 当前支持图文发送以及视频发送：从推荐的角度看，图文的流量会比视频以及纯文字的更好。
- （低优先级）可以考虑纯文字的支持。1. 个人感觉纯文字会大大增加运营的复杂度；2. 纯文字在我的使用场景的价值较低。
- Tags：现已支持。添加合适的 Tags 能带来更多的流量。
- 根据本人实操，小红书每天的发帖量应该是 **50 篇**。
- **（非常重要）小红书的同一个账号不允许在多个网页端登录**，如果你登录了当前 xiaohongshu-mcp 后，就不要再在其他的网页端登录该账号，否则就会把当前 MCP 的账号“踢出登录”。你可以使用移动 App 端进行查看当前账号信息。

**风险说明**

1. 该项目是在自己的另外一个项目的基础上开源出来的，原来的项目稳定运行一年多，没有出现过封号的情况，只有出现过 Cookies 过期需要重新登录。
2. 我是使用 Claude Code 接入，稳定自动化运营数周后，验证没有问题后开源。

该项目是基于学习的目的，禁止一切违法行为。

**实操结果**

第一天点赞/收藏数达到了 999+，

## 1. 使用教程

### 1.1. 快速开始（推荐）

**方式一：下载预编译二进制文件**

直接从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp/releases) 下载对应平台的二进制文件：

**主程序（MCP 服务）：**

- **macOS Apple Silicon**: `xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64`
- **macOS Intel**: `xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-amd64`
- **Windows x64**: `xiaohongshu-mcp-windows-amd64.exe`
- **Linux x64**: `xiaohongshu-mcp-linux-amd64`

**登录工具：**

- **macOS Apple Silicon**: `xiaohongshu-login-darwin-arm64`
- **macOS Intel**: `xiaohongshu-login-darwin-amd64`
- **Windows x64**: `xiaohongshu-login-windows-amd64.exe`
- **Linux x64**: `xiaohongshu-login-linux-amd64`

使用步骤：

```bash
# 1. 首先运行登录工具
chmod +x xiaohongshu-login-darwin-arm64
./xiaohongshu-login-darwin-arm64

# 2. 然后启动 MCP 服务
chmod +x xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64
./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64
```

**⚠️ 重要提示**：首次运行时会自动下载无头浏览器（约 150MB），请确保网络连接正常。后续运行无需重复下载。

**方式二：源码编译**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;源码编译安装详情&lt;/summary&gt;

依赖 Golang 环境，安装方法请参考 [Golang 官方文档](https://go.dev/doc/install)。

设置 Go 国内源的代理，

```bash
# 配置 GOPROXY 环境变量，以下三选一

# 1. 七牛 CDN
go env -w  GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct

# 2. 阿里云
go env -w GOPROXY=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/goproxy/,direct

# 3. 官方
go env -w  GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io,direct
```

&lt;/details&gt;

**方式三：使用 Docker 容器（最简单）**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Docker 部署详情&lt;/summary&gt;

使用 Docker 部署是最简单的方式，无需安装任何开发环境。

**1. 从 Docker Hub 拉取镜像（推荐）**

我们提供了预构建的 Docker 镜像，可以直接从 Docker Hub 拉取使用：

```bash
# 拉取最新镜像
docker pull xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp
```

Docker Hub 地址：[https://hub.docker.com/r/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp](https://hub.docker.com/r/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp)

**2. 使用 Docker Compose 启动（推荐）**

我们提供了配置好的 `docker-compose.yml` 文件，可以直接使用：

```bash
# 下载 docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp/main/docker/docker-compose.yml

# 或者如果已经克隆了项目，进入 docker 目录
cd docker

# 启动服务
docker compose up -d

# 查看日志
docker compose logs -f

# 停止服务
docker compose stop
```

**3. 自己构建镜像（可选）**

```bash
# 在项目根目录运行
docker build -t xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp .
```

**4. 配置说明**

**使用二进制文件**：

```bash
# 运行对应平台的登录工具
./xiaohongshu-login-darwin-arm64
```

**使用源码**：

```bash
go run cmd/login/main.go
```

### 1.3. 启动 MCP 服务

启动 xiaohongshu-mcp 服务。

**使用二进制文件**：

```bash
# 默认：无头模式，没有浏览器界面
./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64

# 非无头模式，有浏览器界面
./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64 -headless=false
```

**使用源码**：

```bash
# 默认：无头模式，没有浏览器界面
go run .

# 非无头模式，有浏览器界面
go run . -headless=false
```

# 添加 HTTP MCP 服务器
claude mcp add --transport http xiaohongshu-mcp http://localhost:18060/mcp

# 检查 MCP 是否添加成功（确保 MCP 已经启动的前提下，运行下面命令）
claude mcp list
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cursor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

#### 配置文件的方式

创建或编辑 MCP 配置文件：

**项目级配置**（推荐）：
在项目根目录创建 `.cursor/mcp.json`：

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;xiaohongshu-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:18060/mcp&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;小红书内容发布服务 - MCP Streamable HTTP&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

**全局配置**：
在用户目录创建 `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (同样内容)。

#### 使用步骤

1. 确保小红书 MCP 服务正在运行
2. 保存配置文件后，重启 Cursor
3. 在 Cursor 聊天中，工具应该自动可用
4. 可以通过聊天界面的 &quot;Available Tools&quot; 查看已连接的 MCP 工具

**Demo**

插件 MCP 接入：

![cursor_mcp_settings](./assets/cursor_mcp_settings.png)

调用 MCP 工具：（以检查登录状态为例）

![cursor_mcp_check_login](./assets/cursor_mcp_check_login.png)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;VSCode&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

#### 方法一：使用命令面板配置

1. 按 `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` 打开命令面板
2. 运行 `MCP: Add Server` 命令
3. 选择 `HTTP` 方式。
4. 输入地址： `http://localhost:18060/mcp`，或者修改成对应的 Server 地址。
5. 输入 MCP 名字： `xiaohongshu-mcp`。

#### 方法二：直接编辑配置文件

**工作区配置**（推荐）：
在项目根目录创建 `.vscode/mcp.json`：

```json
{
  &quot;servers&quot;: {
    &quot;xiaohongshu-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:18060/mcp&quot;,
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;
    }
  },
  &quot;inputs&quot;: []
}
```

**查看配置**：

![vscode_config](./assets/vscode_mcp_config.png)

1. 确认运行状态。
2. 查看 `tools` 是否正确检测。

**Demo**

以搜索帖子内容为例：

![vscode_mcp_search](./assets/vscode_search_demo.png)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google Gemini CLI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

在 `~/.gemini/settings.json` 或项目目录 `.gemini/settings.json` 中配置：

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;xiaohongshu&quot;: {
      &quot;httpUrl&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:18060/mcp&quot;,
      &quot;timeout&quot;: 30000
    }
  }
}
```

更多信息请参考 [Gemini CLI MCP 文档](https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/docs/tools/mcp-server.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;MCP Inspector&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

调试工具，用于测试 MCP 连接：

```bash
# 启动 MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector

# 在浏览器中连接到：http://localhost:18060/mcp
```

使用步骤：

- 使用 MCP Inspector 测试连接
- 测试 Ping Server 功能验证连接
- 检查 List Tools 是否返回 6 个工具

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cline&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Cline 是一个强大的 AI 编程助手，支持 MCP 协议集成。

#### 配置方法

在 Cline 的 MCP 设置中添加以下配置：

```json
{
  &quot;xiaohongshu-mcp&quot;: {
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:18060/mcp&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;streamableHttp&quot;,
    &quot;autoApprove&quot;: [],
    &quot;disabled&quot;: false
  }
}
```

#### 使用步骤

1. 确保小红书 MCP 服务正在运行（`http://localhost:18060/mcp`）
2. 在 Cline 中打开 MCP 设置
3. 添加上述配置到 MCP 服务器列表
4. 保存配置并重启 Cline
5. 在对话中可以直接使用小红书相关功能

#### 配置说明

- `url`: MCP 服务地址
- `type`: 使用 `streamableHttp` 类型以获得更好的性能
- `autoApprove`: 可配置自动批准的工具列表（留空表示手动批准）
- `disabled`: 设置为 `false` 启用此 MCP 服务

#### 使用示例

配置完成后，可以在 Cline 中直接使用自然语言操作小红书：

```

```

```
帮我发布一篇关于春天的图文到小红书，使用这张图片：/path/to/spring.jpg
```

```
搜索小红书上关于&quot;美食&quot;的内容
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;其他支持 HTTP MCP 的客户端&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

任何支持 HTTP MCP 协议的客户端都可以连接到：`http://localhost:18060/mcp`

基本配置模板：

```json
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;xiaohongshu-mcp&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:18060/mcp&quot;,
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;

## What and why

Since the start of modern AI in late 2022 we&#039;ve seen an **_extraordinary_** number of AI applications for accomplishing tasks. There are thousands of websites, chat-bots, mobile apps, and other interfaces for using all the different AI out there.

It&#039;s all really exciting and powerful, but _it&#039;s not easy to integrate this functionality into our lives._

&lt;div class=&quot;align center&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In other words, AI doesn&#039;t have a capabilities problem—it has an &lt;em&gt;integration&lt;/em&gt; problem.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Fabric was created to address this by creating and organizing the fundamental units of AI—the prompts themselves!**

Fabric organizes prompts by real-world task, allowing people to create, collect, and organize their most important AI solutions in a single place for use in their favorite tools. And if you&#039;re command-line focused, you can use Fabric itself as the interface!

## Changelog

Fabric is evolving rapidly.

Stay current with the latest features by reviewing the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for all recent changes.

## Philosophy

&gt; AI isn&#039;t a thing; it&#039;s a _magnifier_ of a thing. And that thing is **human creativity**.

We believe the purpose of technology is to help humans flourish, so when we talk about AI we start with the **human** problems we want to solve.

### Breaking problems into components

Our approach is to break problems into individual pieces (see below) and then apply AI to them one at a time. See below for some examples.

&lt;img width=&quot;2078&quot; alt=&quot;augmented_challenges&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/assets/50654/31997394-85a9-40c2-879b-b347e4701f06&quot;&gt;

### Too many prompts

Prompts are good for this, but the biggest challenge I faced in 2023——which still exists today—is **the sheer number of AI prompts out there**. We all have prompts that are useful, but it&#039;s hard to discover new ones, know if they are good or not, _and manage different versions of the ones we like_.

One of `fabric`&#039;s primary features is helping people collect and integrate prompts, which we call _Patterns_, into various parts of their lives.

Fabric has Patterns for all sorts of life and work activities, including:

- Extracting the most interesting parts of YouTube videos and podcasts
- Writing an essay in your own voice with just an idea as an input
- Summarizing opaque academic papers
- Creating perfectly matched AI art prompts for a piece of writing
- Rating the quality of content to see if you want to read/watch the whole thing
- Getting summaries of long, boring content
- Explaining code to you
- Turning bad documentation into usable documentation
- Creating social media posts from any content input
- And a million more…

## Installation

### One-Line Install (Recommended)

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/fabric/main/scripts/installer/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/fabric/main/scripts/installer/install.ps1 | iex
```

&gt; See [scripts/installer/README.md](./scripts/installer/README.md) for custom installation options and troubleshooting.

### Manual Binary Downloads

The latest release binary archives and their expected SHA256 hashes can be found at &lt;https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest&gt;

### Using package managers

**NOTE:** using Homebrew or the Arch Linux package managers makes `fabric` available as `fabric-ai`, so add
the following alias to your shell startup files to account for this:

```bash
alias fabric=&#039;fabric-ai&#039;
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

`brew install fabric-ai`

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

`yay -S fabric-ai`

#### Windows

Use the official Microsoft supported `Winget` tool:

`winget install danielmiessler.Fabric`

### From Source

To install Fabric, [make sure Go is installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), and then run the following command.

```bash
# Install Fabric directly from the repo
go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/cmd/fabric@latest
```

### Docker

Run Fabric using pre-built Docker images:

```bash
# Use latest image from Docker Hub
docker run --rm -it kayvan/fabric:latest --version

# Use specific version from GHCR
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/ksylvan/fabric:v1.4.305 --version

# Run setup (first time)
mkdir -p $HOME/.fabric-config
docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.fabric-config:/root/.config/fabric kayvan/fabric:latest --setup

# Use Fabric with your patterns
docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.fabric-config:/root/.config/fabric kayvan/fabric:latest -p summarize

# Run the REST API server (see REST API Server section)
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -v $HOME/.fabric-config:/root/.config/fabric kayvan/fabric:latest --serve
```

**Images available at:**

- Docker Hub: [kayvan/fabric](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kayvan/fabric/general)
- GHCR: [ksylvan/fabric](https://github.com/ksylvan/fabric/pkgs/container/fabric)

See [scripts/docker/README.md](./scripts/docker/README.md) for building custom images and advanced configuration.

### Environment Variables

You may need to set some environment variables in your `~/.bashrc` on linux or `~/.zshrc` file on mac to be able to run the `fabric` command. Here is an example of what you can add:

For Intel based macs or linux

```bash
# Golang environment variables
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go

# Update PATH to include GOPATH and GOROOT binaries
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

for Apple Silicon based macs

```bash
# Golang environment variables
export GOROOT=$(brew --prefix go)/libexec
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

### Setup

Now run the following command

```bash
# Run the setup to set up your directories and keys
fabric --setup
```

If everything works you are good to go.

### Per-Pattern Model Mapping

 You can configure specific models for individual patterns using environment variables
 like `FABRIC_MODEL_PATTERN_NAME=vendor|model`

 This makes it easy to maintain these per-pattern model mappings in your shell startup files

## Key Features

- **[Distributed Transactions](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/distributed-transactions-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB uses a two-phase commit protocol to ensure ACID compliance, providing strong consistency. Transactions span multiple nodes, and TiDB&#039;s distributed nature ensures data correctness even in the presence of network partitions or node failures.

- **[Horizontal and Vertical Scalability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/scale-tidb-using-tiup?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes or vertically by increasing resources of existing nodes, all without downtime. TiDB&#039;s architecture separates computing from storage, enabling you to adjust both independently as needed for flexibility and growth.

- **[High Availability](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/high-availability-with-multi-az?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Built-in Raft consensus protocol ensures reliability and automated failover. Data is stored in multiple replicas, and transactions are committed only after writing to the majority of replicas, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability, even if some replicas fail. Geographic placement of replicas can be configured for different disaster tolerance levels.

- **[Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP)](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/htap-demystified-defining-modern-data-architecture-tidb?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB provides two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. The TiDB Server coordinates query execution across both TiKV and TiFlash to optimize performance.

- **[Cloud-Native](https://www.pingcap.com/cloud-native?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB can be deployed in public clouds, on-premises, or natively in Kubernetes. [TiDB Operator](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) helps manage TiDB on Kubernetes, automating cluster operations, while [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) provides a fully-managed service for easy and economical deployment, allowing users to set up clusters with just a few clicks.

- **[MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/mysql-compatibility?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: TiDB is compatible with MySQL 8.0, allowing you to use familiar protocols, frameworks and tools. You can migrate applications to TiDB without changing any code, or with minimal modifications. Additionally, TiDB provides a suite of [data migration tools](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/ecosystem-tool-user-guide?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb) to help easily migrate application data into TiDB.

- **[Open Source Commitment](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/open-source-is-in-our-dna-reaffirming-tidb-commitment?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=tidb)**: Open source is at the core of TiDB&#039;s identity. All source code is available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license, including enterprise-grade features. TiDB is built with the belief that open source enables transparency, innovation, and collaboration. We actively encourage contributions from the community to help build a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem, reaffirming our commitment to open development and accessibility for everyone.

## Project-HAMi: Heterogeneous AI Computing Virtualization Middleware

## Introduction

HAMi, formerly known as &#039;k8s-vGPU-scheduler&#039;, is a Heterogeneous device management middleware for Kubernetes. It can manage different types of heterogeneous devices (like GPU, NPU, etc.), share heterogeneous devices among pods, make better scheduling decisions based on topology of devices and scheduling policies.

It aims to remove the gap between different Heterogeneous devices, and provide a unified interface for users to manage with no changes to their applications. As of December 2024, HAMi has been widely used not only in Internet, public cloud and private cloud, but also broadly adopted in various vertical industries including finance, securities, energy, telecommunications, education, and manufacturing. More than 50 companies or institutions are not only end users but also active contributors. 

![cncf_logo](imgs/cncf-logo.png)

HAMi is a sandbox and [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?item=orchestration-management--scheduling-orchestration--hami) project of  
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/)(CNCF), 
[CNAI Landscape project](https://landscape.cncf.io/?group=cnai&amp;item=cnai--general-orchestration--hami).


## Device virtualization

HAMi provides device virtualization for several heterogeneous devices including GPU, by supporting device sharing and device resource isolation. For the list of devices supporting device virtualization, see [supported devices](#supported-devices)

### Device sharing

- Allows partial device allocation by specifying device core usage.
- Allows partial device allocation by specifying device memory.
- Imposes a hard limit on streaming multiprocessors.
- Requires zero changes to existing programs.
- Support [dynamic-mig](docs/dynamic-mig-support.md) feature, [example](examples/nvidia/dynamic_mig_example.yaml)

&lt;img src=&quot;./imgs/example.png&quot; width = &quot;500&quot; /&gt; 

### Device Resources Isolation

A simple demonstration of device isolation:
A task with the following resources will see 3000M device memory inside container:

```yaml
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # declare how many physical GPUs the pod needs
          nvidia.com/gpumem: 3000 # identifies 3G GPU memory each physical GPU allocates to the pod
```

![img](./imgs/hard_limit.jpg)

&gt; Note:
1. **After installing HAMi, the value of `nvidia.com/gpu` registered on the node defaults to the number of vGPUs.**
2. **When requesting resources in a pod, `nvidia.com/gpu` refers to the number of physical GPUs required by the current pod.**

### Supported devices

[NVIDIA GPU](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi#preparing-your-gpu-nodes)   
[Cambricon MLU](docs/cambricon-mlu-support.md)   
[HYGON DCU](docs/hygon-dcu-support.md)   
[Iluvatar CoreX GPU](docs/iluvatar-gpu-support.md)   
[Moore Threads GPU](docs/mthreads-support.md)   
[HUAWEI Ascend NPU](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/ascend-device-plugin/blob/main/README.md)   
[MetaX GPU](docs/metax-support.md)   

## Architect

&lt;img src=&quot;./imgs/hami-arch.png&quot; width = &quot;600&quot; /&gt; 

HAMi consists of several components, including a unified mutatingwebhook, a unified scheduler extender, different device-plugins and different in-container virtualization technics for each heterogeneous AI devices.

## Quick Start

### Choose your orchestrator

[![kube-scheduler](https://img.shields.io/badge/kube-scheduler-blue)](#prerequisites)
[![volcano-scheduler](https://img.shields.io/badge/volcano-scheduler-orange)](docs/how-to-use-volcano-vgpu.md)

### Prerequisites

The list of prerequisites for running the NVIDIA device plugin is described below:

- NVIDIA drivers &gt;= 440
- nvidia-docker version &gt; 2.0
- default runtime configured as nvidia for containerd/docker/cri-o container runtime
- Kubernetes version &gt;= 1.18
- glibc &gt;= 2.17 &amp; glibc &lt; 2.30
- kernel version &gt;= 3.10
- helm &gt; 3.0

### Install

First, Label your GPU nodes for scheduling with HAMi by adding the label &quot;gpu=on&quot;. Without this label, the nodes cannot be managed by our scheduler.

```
kubectl label nodes {nodeid} gpu=on
```

Add our repo in helm

```
helm repo add hami-charts https://project-hami.github.io/HAMi/
```

Use the following command for deployment:

```
helm install hami hami-charts/hami -n kube-system
```

Customize your installation by adjusting the [configs](docs/config.md).

Verify your installation using the following command:

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

If both `hami-device-plugin` (formerly known as `vgpu-device-plugin`)  and `hami-scheduler` (formerly known as `vgpu-scheduler`)  pods are in the *Running* state, your installation is successful. You can try examples [here](examples/nvidia/default_use.yaml) 

### WebUI

[HAMi-WebUI](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi-WebUI) is available after HAMi v2.4

For installation guide, click [here](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi-WebUI/blob/main/docs/installation/helm/index.md)

### Monitor

Monitoring is automatically enabled after installation. Obtain an overview of cluster information by visiting the following URL:

&gt; **Note** The status of a node won&#039;t be collected before you submit a task

## Notes

- If you don&#039;t request vGPUs when using the device plugin with NVIDIA images all the GPUs on the machine may be exposed inside your container
- Currently, A100 MIG can be supported in only &quot;none&quot; and &quot;mixed&quot; modes.
- Tasks with the &quot;nodeName&quot; field cannot be scheduled at the moment; please use &quot;nodeSelector&quot; instead.

## What is Coze Loop

[Coze Loop](https://www.coze.cn/loop) is a developer-oriented, platform-level solution focused on the development and operation of AI agents. It addresses various challenges faced during the AI agent development process, providing full lifecycle management capabilities from development, debugging, evaluation, to monitoring.

Based on the commercial version, Coze Loop introduces an open-source edition that offers developers free access to core foundational feature modules. By sharing its core technology framework in an open-source model, developers can customize and extend according to business needs, facilitating community co-construction, sharing, and exchange, helping developers participate in AI agent exploration and practice with zero barriers.

## What can Coze Loop do?

Coze Loop helps developers develop and operate AI Agent more efficiently by providing full lifecycle management capabilities. Whether it is prompt engineering, AI Agent evaluation, or monitoring and optimization after deployment, Coze Loop provides powerful tools and intelligent support, greatly simplifying the development process of AI Agents and enhancing their operational performance and stability.

* **Prompt development**: The Prompt development module of Coze Loop provides developers with end-to-end support for writing, debugging, optimizing, and version management. Through a visual Playground, it enables real-time interactive testing of prompts, allowing developers to intuitively compare the output of different LLMs.
* **Evaluation**: The Coze Loop evaluation module provides developers with systematic evaluation capabilities, enabling automated multi-dimensional testing of prompts and Coze agents&#039; output, such as accuracy, conciseness, compliance, and more.
* **Observability**: Coze Loop provides developers with observability for the entire execution process, fully recording every stage from user input to AI output, including key stages such as prompt parsing, model invocation, and tool execution, and automatically capturing intermediate results and exceptions.

## Feature list

| **Feature** | **Functional points** |
| --- | --- |
| Prompt debugging | *Playground debugging and comparison &lt;br&gt;* Prompt version management |
| Evaluation | *Manage evaluation sets &lt;br&gt; Management evaluator &lt;br&gt;* Manage experiments |
| Observation | SDK trace reporting &lt;br&gt; * Trace data observation |
| Model | Support integration with OpenAI, Volcengine Ark, and other models |

## Quick Start
&gt;
&gt; Refer to [Quick Start](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop/wiki/2.-Quickstart) to learn in detail how to install and deploy the latest version of Coze Loop.

### Deployment method 1: Docker deployment (Docker Compose)
&gt;
&gt; Please install and start Docker Engine before you start.

Procedure:

1. Clone the source code.
   Run the following command to obtain the latest version of the Coze Loop source code.

   ```Bash
   # Clone the code
   git clone https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop.git

   # Enter the coze-loop directory
   cd coze-loop
   ```

2. Configure a model.
   1. Enter the `coze-loop` directory.
   2. Edit the file `release/deployment/docker-compose/conf/model_config.yaml`.
   3. Modify the api_key and model fields. Take Volcengine Ark as an example:
      * api_key: Volcengine Ark API Key. Users in China can refer to the [Volcengine Ark documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1541594), while users outside China can refer to the [BytePlus ModelArk documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1361424?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=coze_open_source).
      * model: The Endpoint ID of the Volcengine Ark model access point. Users within China can refer to [the Volcengine Ark documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1099522); users outside China can refer to [the BytePlus ModelArk documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1099522?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=coze_open_source).
3. Start the service.
   Run the following commands to quickly deploy the open-source version of Coze Loop using Docker Compose.

   ```Bash
   # Start the service (default: development mode)
   # Run in the coze-loop/ directory
   make compose-up
   ```

4. Access the Coze Loop open-source version through your browser `http://localhost:8082`.

### Deployment method 2: Kubernetes deployment using Helm Chart

&gt; * The Kubernetes cluster has been prepared, the Nginx Ingress add-ons have been enabled, and the Kubectl and Helm tools have been installed.
&gt; * To quickly try it out locally, you can deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. For detailed steps, refer to [Quick Start](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop/wiki/2.-Quickstart).

Procedure:

1. Run the following command to obtain the Helm Chart package.

   ```Bash
   helm pull oci://docker.io/cozedev/coze-loop --version 1.0.0-helm
   tar -zxvf coze-loop-1.0.0-helm.tgz &amp;&amp; cd coze-loop &amp;&amp; rm -f ../coze-loop-1.0.0-helm.tgz
   ```

2. Configure a model.
   Go to the `coze-loop` directory and edit the `release/deployment/helm-chart/umbrella/conf/model_config.yaml` file. Configure the following fields, using Volcengine Ark as an example:
   * api_key: Volcengine Ark API Key. Users in mainland China can refer to the [Volcengine Ark documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1541594), while users outside mainland China can refer to the [BytePlus ModelArk documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1361424?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=coze_open_source).
   * model: The Endpoint ID of the Volcengine Ark model access point. Users in China can refer to the [Volcengine Ark documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1099522), while users outside China can refer to the [BytePlus ModelArk documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1099522?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=coze_open_source).
3. Configure Ingress rules.
   Ingress is used to expose services to external networks. You need to configure the `templates/ingress.yaml` file in the project directory according to the actual cluster situation, manually modify parameters such as ingressClassName, and configure elements such as class, instance, host, and IP allocation.
4. Deploy and start the service.
   Execute the following commands to quickly deploy the open-source version of Coze Loop using Helm.

   ```Bash
   # Run in the coze-loop/ directory
   make helm-up
   # After the service deployment is complete, check the status of the cluster pods
   make helm-pod
   # Check the service startup logs. If both the app and nginx are running normally, the deployment is successful
   make helm-logf-app
   make helm-logf-nginx
   ```

5. Access the Coze Loop open source edition via a browser.
   The access domain name and URL depend on the domain name and URL assigned to your cluster.
6. Start customizing your Coze Loop project.
   Refer to the examples in the `examples/` directory. Modify `values.yaml` to override the default settings. After making changes, rerun `make helm-up` for the changes to take effect.

## Credits

- [Xray-core v1.0.0](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was forked from [v2fly-core 9a03cc5](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/commit/9a03cc5c98d04cc28320fcee26dbc236b3291256), and we have made &amp; accumulated a huge number of enhancements over time, check [the release notes for each version](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases).
- For third-party projects used in [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core), check your local or [the latest go.mod](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/blob/main/go.mod).

## One-line Compilation

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED=0
go build -o xray.exe -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags=&quot;-s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

### Reproducible Releases

Make sure that you are using the same Go version, and remember to set the git commit id (7 bytes):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;all=-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```

If you are compiling a 32-bit MIPS/MIPSLE target, use this command instead:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o xray -trimpath -buildvcs=false -gcflags=&quot;-l=4&quot; -ldflags=&quot;-X github.com/xtls/xray-core/core.build=REPLACE -s -w -buildid=&quot; -v ./main
```
