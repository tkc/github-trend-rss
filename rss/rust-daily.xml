## Features and Roadmap

Limbo is a _work-in-progress_, in-process OLTP database engine library written in Rust that has:

* **SQLite compatibility** [[doc](COMPAT.md)] for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API
* **Language bindings** for JavaScript/WebAssembly, Rust, Go, Python, and [Java](bindings/java)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **OS support** for Linux, macOS, and Windows

In the future, we will be also working on:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput.
* **Indexing for vector search**.
* **Improved schema management** including better `ALTER` support and strict column types by default.

## Getting Started

Please see the [Limbo Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üíª Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `limbo` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/releases/latest/download/limbo_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the shell to execute SQL statements:

```console
Limbo
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
limbo&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT);
limbo&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
limbo&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
limbo&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;ü¶Ä Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add limbo
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;‚ú® JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i limbo-wasm
```

Example usage:

```js
import { Database } from &#039;limbo-wasm&#039;;

const db = new Database(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üêç Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
pip install pylimbo
```

Example usage:

```python
import limbo

con = limbo.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üêπ Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the library and set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include limbo&#039;s target directory
```console
cargo build --package limbo-go
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/limbo/target/debug:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
3. Use the driver

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
go install github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/tursodatabase/limbo&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;sqlite3&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;‚òïÔ∏è Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Limbo into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Limbo with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

## FAQ

### Is Limbo ready for production use?

Limbo is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Limbo different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Limbo is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Limbo is not - although it is evolving rapidly. As the project starts to near production readiness, we plan to rename it to just &quot;Turso&quot;. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Workspaces) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Window-Rules#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Screencasting#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Tabs)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Layout#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee¬†PC¬†900 from¬†2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: no built-in support, but xwayland-satellite is [easy to set up](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-xwayland-satellite) and works very well.
    - Steam and games, including Proton: work perfectly through xwayland-satellite.
    - JetBrains IDEs, Ghidra: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Discord and other Electron apps: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Chromium and VSCode: work perfectly natively on Wayland with the right flags.
    - X11 apps that want to position windows or bars at specific screen coordinates: won&#039;t work well; you can run them in a nested compositor like [labwc](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-the-labwc-wayland-compositor) or [rootful Xwayland](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#directly-running-xwayland-in-rootful-mode).
    - Display scaling (integer or fractional) keeps X11 apps crisp, but you need the latest xwayland-satellite.
    For games, you can run them in [gamescope] at native resolution, even with display scaling.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

## Media

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/reqwest/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/reqwest)

An ergonomic, batteries-included HTTP Client for Rust.

- Async and blocking `Client`s
- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- Customizable redirect policy
- HTTP Proxies
- HTTPS via system-native TLS (or optionally, rustls)
- Cookie Store
- WASM


## Example

This asynchronous example uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) and enables some
optional features, so your `Cargo.toml` could look like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = &quot;0.12&quot;, features = [&quot;json&quot;] }
tokio = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```

And then the code:

```rust,no_run
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let resp = reqwest::get(&quot;https://httpbin.org/ip&quot;)
        .await?
        .json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;()
        .await?;
    println!(&quot;{resp:#?}&quot;);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Commercial Support

For private advice, support, reviews, access to the maintainer, and the like, reach out for [commercial support][sponsor].

## Requirements

On Linux:

- OpenSSL with headers. See https://docs.rs/openssl for supported versions
  and more details. Alternatively you can enable the `native-tls-vendored`
  feature to compile a copy of OpenSSL. Or, you can use [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls)
  via `rustls-tls` or other `rustls-tls-*` features.

On Windows and macOS:

- Nothing.

By default, Reqwest uses [rust-native-tls](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls),
which will use the operating system TLS framework if available, meaning Windows
and macOS. On Linux, it will use the available OpenSSL or fail to build if
not found.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Linter Quick Start

The linter is ready to catch mistakes for you. It comes with 93 rules turned on by default (out of 430+ in total) and no configuration is required.

To get started, run [oxlint][npm-oxlint] or via `npx`:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds.

&lt;/p&gt;

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance

- The parser aims to be the fastest Rust-based ready-for-production parser.
- The linter is more than 50 times faster than [ESLint], and scales with the number of CPU cores.

&lt;/p&gt;

## ‚å®Ô∏è Rust, Node.js and Wasm Usage

### Rust

Individual crates are published, you may use them to build your own JavaScript tools.

- The umbrella crate [oxc][docs-oxc-url] exports all public crates from this repository.
- The AST and parser crates [oxc_ast][docs-ast-url] and [oxc_parser][docs-parser-url] are production ready.
- The resolver crate [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] for module resolution is also production ready.
- Example usages of these crates can be found in their respective `crates/*/examples` directory.

While Rust has gained a reputation for its comparatively slower compilation speed,
we have dedicated significant effort to fine-tune the Rust compilation speed.
Our aim is to minimize any impact on your development workflow,
ensuring that developing your own Oxc based tools remains a smooth and efficient experience.

This is demonstrated by our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain),
where warm runs complete in 3 minutes.

### Node.js

- via napi: [oxc-parser][npm-napi-parser], [oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform]

### Wasm

- [@oxc-parser/wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-parser/wasm)

- [Linter](#-linter)
- [Resolver](#-resolver)
- [Minifier](#-minifier)
- [Formatter](#-formatter)
- [Transformer](#-transformer)

### üî∏ AST and Parser

Oxc maintains its own AST and parser, which is by far the fastest and most conformant JavaScript and TypeScript (including JSX and TSX) parser written in Rust.

As the parser often represents a key performance bottleneck in JavaScript tooling,
any minor improvements can have a cascading effect on our downstream tools.
By developing our parser, we have the opportunity to explore and implement well-researched performance techniques.

While many existing JavaScript tools rely on [estree] as their AST specification,
a notable drawback is its abundance of ambiguous nodes.
This ambiguity often leads to confusion during development with [estree].

The Oxc AST differs slightly from the [estree] AST by removing ambiguous nodes and introducing distinct types.
For example, instead of using a generic [estree] `Identifier`,
the Oxc AST provides specific types such as `BindingIdentifier`, `IdentifierReference`, and `IdentifierName`.
This clear distinction greatly enhances the development experience by aligning more closely with the ECMAScript specification.

#### üèÜ Parser Performance

Our [benchmark][parser-benchmark] reveals that the Oxc parser surpasses the speed of the [swc] parser by approximately 3 times and the [Biome][biome] parser by 5 times.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST is allocated in a memory arena (&lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/bumpalo&quot;&gt;bumpalo&lt;/a&gt;) for fast AST memory allocation and deallocation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Short strings are inlined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/compact_str&quot;&gt;CompactString&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No other heap allocations are done except the above two.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Scope binding, symbol resolution and some syntax errors are not done in the parser, they are delegated to the semantic analyzer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### üî∏ Linter

The linter embraces convention over configuration, eliminating the need for extensive configuration and plugin setup.
Unlike other linters like [ESLint], which often require intricate configurations and plugin installations (e.g. [@typescript-eslint]),
our linter only requires a single command that you can immediately run on your codebase:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

#### üèÜ Linter Performance

The linter is 50 - 100 times faster than [ESLint] depending on the number of rules and number of CPU cores used.
It completes in less than a second for most codebases with a few hundred files and completes in a few seconds for
larger monorepos. See [bench-javascript-linter](https://github.com/Boshen/bench-javascript-linter) for details.

As an upside, the binary is approximately 5MB, whereas [ESLint] and its associated plugin dependencies can easily exceed 100.

You may also download the linter binary from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest) as a standalone binary,
this lets you run the linter without a Node.js installation in your CI.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Oxc parser is used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST visit is a fast operation due to linear memory scan from the memory arena.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Files are linted in a multi-threaded environment, so scales with the total number of CPU cores.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Every single lint rule is tuned for performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### üî∏ Resolver

Module resolution plays a crucial role in JavaScript tooling, especially for tasks like multi-file analysis or bundling. However, it can often become a performance bottleneck.
To address this, we developed [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url].

The resolver is production-ready and is currently being used in [Rolldown][rolldown]. Usage and examples can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc_resolver).

### üî∏ Transformer

A transformer is responsible for turning higher versions of ECMAScript to a lower version that can be used in older browsers.

TypeScript and React transforms are complete. See [Milestone 2](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/2859) for current goals.

[oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform] can be used for experimentation.

### üî∏ Isolated Declarations

[TypeScript Isolated Declarations Emit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/#isolated-declarations) without using the TypeScript compiler.

Our [benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-transformer) indicates that our implementation is at least 20 times faster than the TypeScript compiler.

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) or [crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_isolated_declarations) can be used for this task.

### üî∏ Minifier

JavaScript minification plays a crucial role in optimizing website performance as it reduces the amount of data sent to users,
resulting in faster page loads.
This holds tremendous economic value, particularly for e-commerce websites, where every second can equate to millions of dollars.

However, existing minifiers typically require a trade-off between compression quality and speed.
You have to choose between the slowest for the best compression or the fastest for less compression.
But what if we could develop a faster minifier without compromising on compression?

We are actively working on a prototype that aims to achieve this goal,
by porting all test cases from well-known minifiers such as [google-closure-compiler], [terser], [esbuild], and [tdewolff-minify].

Preliminary results indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives.
With the Oxc minifier, you can expect faster minification times without sacrificing compression quality.

### üî∏ Formatter

While [prettier] has established itself as the de facto code formatter for JavaScript, there is a significant demand in the developer community for a less opinionated alternative. Recognizing this need, our ambition is to undertake research and development to create a new JavaScript formatter that offers increased flexibility and customization options.

The [prototype](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_formatter) is currently work in progress.

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

Who uses quiche?
----------------

### Cloudflare

quiche powers Cloudflare edge network&#039;s [HTTP/3 support][cloudflare-http3]. The
[cloudflare-quic.com](https://cloudflare-quic.com) website can be used for
testing and experimentation.

### Android

Android&#039;s DNS resolver uses quiche to [implement DNS over HTTP/3][android-http3].

### curl

quiche can be [integrated into curl][curl-http3] to provide support for HTTP/3.

[cloudflare-http3]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/
[android-http3]: https://security.googleblog.com/2022/07/dns-over-http3-in-android.html
[curl-http3]: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate.

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

[pace]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-7.7
[`SO_TXTIME`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-etf.8.html

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

[examples/]: quiche/examples/

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.82 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[Android NDK]: https://developer.android.com/ndk
[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
- [cloudflare/quiche-qns](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche-qns)

The `latest` tag will be updated whenever quiche master branch updates.

**cloudflare/quiche**

Provides a server and client installed in /usr/local/bin.

**cloudflare/quiche-qns**

Provides the script to test quiche within the [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).

InfluxDB Core is a database built to collect, process, transform, and store event and time series data. It is ideal for use cases that require real-time ingest and fast query response times to build user interfaces, monitoring, and automation solutions.

Common use cases include:

- Monitoring sensor data
- Server monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Network monitoring
- Financial market and trading analytics
- Behavioral analytics

InfluxDB is optimized for scenarios where near real-time data monitoring is essential and queries 
need to return quickly to support user experiences such as dashboards and interactive user interfaces.

InfluxDB 3 Core‚Äôs feature highlights include:

- Diskless architecture with object storage support (or local disk with no dependencies)
- Fast query response times (under 10ms for last-value queries, or 30ms for distinct metadata)
- Embedded Python VM for plugins and triggers
- Parquet file persistence
- Compatibility with InfluxDB 1.x and 2.x write APIs
- Compatability with InfluxDB 1.x query API (InfluxQL)

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

Cross-platform multi-console emulator supporting a number of 8-bit and 16-bit gaming consoles.

Linux, Windows, and web (WASM) are officially supported. Other platforms may work but have not been tested.

## Features

* Emulation for the following consoles:
  * Sega Genesis / Mega Drive
  * Sega CD / Mega CD
  * Sega 32X / Mega 32X
    * This core is currently not well-optimized - full-speed 32X emulation requires a CPU with decent single-core performance
  * Sega Master System / Mark III
  * Game Gear
  * Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) / Famicom
  * Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) / Super Famicom
  * Game Boy / Game Boy Color
* GPU-based renderer with integer prescaling and optional linear interpolation
* Configurable pixel aspect ratio for each console with several different options: accurate to original hardware/TVs, square pixels, and stretched to fill the window
* Support for the Sega Master System FM sound unit expansion
* Support for the Sega Genesis SVP chip, used in _Virtua Racing_
* Support for the most common NES mappers, plus a number of less common mappers
* Support for most SNES coprocessors (e.g. Super FX, SA-1, DSP-1, CX4, S-DD1, SPC7110)
* Support for both 3-button and 6-button Genesis controllers
* Support for keyboard controls and DirectInput gamepad controls
* Save states, fast forward, and rewind
* Some simple horizontal blur and naive anti-dither shaders for blending dithered pixel patterns, which were extremely common on these consoles due to limited color palettes and lack of hardware-supported transparency
* Optional 2x CPU overclocking for Sega Master System and Game Gear emulation
* Optional 2-4x GSU overclocking for SNES Super FX games
* Can run the Titan Overdrive and Titan Overdrive 2 demos for the Mega Drive

TODOs:
* Support multiple Sega CD BIOS versions in GUI and automatically use the correct one based on disc region
* Support 24C64 EEPROM chips (used only in _Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball_ and _College Slam_)

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Servo Parallel Browser Engine Project

Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) language. It is currently developed on
64-bit macOS, 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows, 64-bit OpenHarmony, and Android.

Servo welcomes contribution from everyone. Check out:

- The [Servo Book](https://book.servo.org) for documentation
- [servo.org](https://servo.org/) for news and guides

Coordination of Servo development happens:
- Here in the Github Issues
- On the [Servo Zulip](https://servo.zulipchat.com/)
- In video calls advertised in the [Servo Project](https://github.com/servo/project/issues) repo.

## Prerequisites

See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for software requirements to develop in this repo.

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX

# Set the path of the future wallet.
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[1]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[1]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;
```

## Polars: Blazingly fast DataFrames in Rust, Python, Node.js, R, and SQL

Polars is a DataFrame interface on top of an OLAP Query Engine implemented in Rust using
[Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html) as the memory
model.

- Lazy | eager execution
- Multi-threaded
- SIMD
- Query optimization
- Powerful expression API
- Hybrid Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Rust | Python | NodeJS | R | ...

...    &quot;species&quot;: [&quot;Setosa&quot;, &quot;Versicolor&quot;, &quot;Virginica&quot;],
...    &quot;blooming_season&quot;: [&quot;Spring&quot;, &quot;Summer&quot;, &quot;Fall&quot;]
...})
&gt;&gt;&gt; pl.sql(&quot;&quot;&quot;
... SELECT df.species,
...     AVG(df.sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length,
...     df2.blooming_season
... FROM df
... LEFT JOIN df2 ON df.species = df2.species
... GROUP BY df.species, df2.blooming_season
... &quot;&quot;&quot;).collect()
```

SQL commands can also be run directly from your terminal using the Polars CLI:

```bash
# run an inline SQL query
&gt; polars -c &quot;SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;&quot;

# run interactively
&gt; polars
Polars CLI v0.3.0
Type .help for help.

&gt; SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;
```

Refer to the [Polars CLI repository](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-cli) for more information.

## Performance üöÄüöÄ

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is
still very fast!)

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

We also have a conda package (`conda install -c conda-forge polars`), however pip is the preferred
way to install Polars.

Install Polars with all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[all]&#039;
```

You can also install a subset of all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[numpy,pandas,pyarrow]&#039;
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating Polars regularly to
get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features /
performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```toml
polars = { git = &quot;https://github.com/pola-rs/polars&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;optional git tag&gt;&quot; }
```

Requires Rust version `&gt;=1.80`.

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028), lead
developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

### Installation

Ruff is available as [`ruff`](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) on PyPI.

Invoke Ruff directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```shell
uvx ruff check   # Lint all files in the current directory.
uvx ruff format  # Format all files in the current directory.
```

Or install Ruff with `uv` (recommended), `pip`, or `pipx`:

```shell
# With uv.
uv tool install ruff@latest  # Install Ruff globally.
uv add --dev ruff            # Or add Ruff to your project.

# With pip.
pip install ruff

# With pipx.
pipx install ruff
```

Starting with version `0.5.0`, Ruff can be installed with our standalone installers:

```shell
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ruff/install.sh | sh

# On Windows.
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/ruff/install.ps1 | iex&quot;

# For a specific version.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ruff/0.12.0/install.sh | sh
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/ruff/0.12.0/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

You can also install Ruff via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruff), [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ruff),
and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.12.0
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code
quality tools, including:

&lt;/p&gt;

Difftastic is a structural diff tool that compares files based on
their syntax.

**For installation instructions, see
[Installation](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/installation.html) in
[the manual](http://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/).**

## Basic Example

![Screenshot of difftastic and JS](img/js.png)

In this JavaScript example, we can see:

(1) Difftastic understands nesting. It highlights the matching `{` and
`}`, but understands that `foo()` hasn&#039;t changed despite the leading
whitespace.

(2) Difftastic understands which lines should be aligned. It&#039;s aligned
`bar(1)` on the left with `bar(2)` on the right, even though the
textual content isn&#039;t identical.

(3) Difftastic understands that line-wrapping isn&#039;t
meaningful. `&quot;eric&quot;` is now on a new line, but it hasn&#039;t changed.

## One Minute Demo

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/480875.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/480875)

This one minute screencast demonstrates difftastic usage with both
standalone files and git.

## Languages

Difftastic supports over 30 programming languages, see [the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/languages_supported.html) for the full list.

If a file has an unrecognised extension, difftastic uses a
textual diff with word highlighting.

## Known Issues

Performance. Difftastic scales relatively poorly on files with a large
number of changes, and can use a lot of memory.

Display. Difftastic has a side-by-side display which usually works well, but can
be confusing.

Robustness. Difftastic regularly has releases that fix crashes.

## Non-goals

Patching. Difftastic output is intended for human consumption, and it
does not generate patches that you can apply later. Use `diff` if you
need a patch.

(Patch files are also line-oriented, which is too limited for
difftastic. Difftastic might find additions and removals on the same
line, and it tracks the relationship between line numbers in the old
and new file.)

Merging. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not
address.

## FAQ

### Isn&#039;t this basically `--word-diff --ignore-all-space`?

Word diffing [can&#039;t do
this](https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/1510139929971421191/photo/1).

Difftastic parses your code. It understands when whitespace matters,
such as inside string literals or languages like Python. It understands
that `x-1` is three tokens in JS but one token in Lisp.

### Can I use difftastic with git?

You can! The difftastic manual [includes instructions for git
usage](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html). You can also use it
[with mercurial](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/mercurial.html).

If you&#039;re an Emacs user, check out [this blog
post](https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html)
showing one way to use difftastic with magit, as well as
[difftastic.el](https://github.com/pkryger/difftastic.el).

### Does difftastic integrate with my favourite tool?

Probably not. Difftastic is young. Consider writing a plugin for your
favourite tool, and I will link it in the README!

### What about parse errors?

By default, difftastic falls back to a line-oriented diff whenever
parse errors are encountered.

This is a conservative choice to ensure that difftastic never claims
two syntactically different files are the same.

Parse errors can occur if the file uses language features that the
parser does not understand, if the language relies on a preprocessor
before parsing (e.g. C++), or if the file has genuine syntactic
mistakes.

In practice, difftastic virtually always produces a good result when
there are a few minor parse errors. Consider allowing a small number
of parse errors when using difftastic.

```
$ export DFT_PARSE_ERROR_LIMIT=20
$ difft foo1.c foo2.c
```

### Can difftastic help me with merge conflicts?

Yes! As of version 0.50, difftastic understands merge conflict markers
(i.e. `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;`, `=======` and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`).

Pass your file with conflicts as a single argument to
difftastic. Difftastic will construct the two conflicting files and
diff those.

```
$ difft file_with_conflicts.js
```

### Can difftastic do merges?

No. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not address.

AST diffing is a lossy process from the perspective of a text
diff. Difftastic will ignore whitespace that isn&#039;t syntactically
significant, but merging requires tracking whitespace.

The [mergiraf](https://mergiraf.org/) tool does offer merges based on
a tree-sitter AST however.

### Can difftastic ignore reordering?

No. Difftastic always considers order to be important, so diffing
e.g. `set(1, 2)` and `set(2, 1)` will show changes.

If you&#039;re diffing JSON, consider sorting the keys before passing them
to difftastic.

```
$ difft &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_1.json) &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_2.json)
```

See also [Tricky Cases: Unordered Data
Types](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/tricky_cases.html#unordered-data-types)
in the manual.

### Can I use difftastic to check for syntactic changes without diffing?

Yes. Difftastic can check if the two files have the same AST, without
calculating a diff. This is much faster than normal diffing, and
useful for building tools that check for changes.

For example:

```
$ difft --check-only --exit-code before.js after.js
```

This will set the exit code to 0 if there are no syntactic changes, or
1 if there are changes found.

### Why aren&#039;t colours appearing in my terminal?

Difftastic uses ANSI bright colours by default, but some terminal
themes show bright colours as grey. Solarized is a popular theme that
does this.

If you&#039;re a Solarized user, use `export DFT_BACKGROUND=light` to
disable bright colours, or try a different terminal colour scheme.

### How does it work?

Difftastic treats structural diffing as a graph problem, and uses
Dijkstra&#039;s algorithm.

My [blog
post](https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/)
describes the design, and there is also an [internals section in the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/diffing.html).

[![Tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![Integration tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a simple, high-throughput file client for [mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/the-inside-story-on-mountpoint-for-amazon-s3-a-high-performance-open-source-file-client/). With Mountpoint for Amazon S3, your applications can access objects stored in Amazon S3 through file operations like `open` and `read`. Mountpoint for Amazon S3 automatically translates these operations into S3 object API calls, giving your applications access to the elastic storage and throughput of Amazon S3 through a file interface.

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is optimized for applications that need high read throughput to large objects, potentially from many clients at once, and to write new objects sequentially from a single client at a time. This means it&#039;s a great fit for applications that use a file interface to:
* read large objects from S3, potentially from many instances concurrently, without downloading them to local storage first
* access only some S3 objects out of a larger data set, but can&#039;t predict which objects in advance
* upload their output to S3 directly, or upload files from local storage with tools like `cp`

but probably not the right fit for applications that:
* use file operations that S3 doesn&#039;t natively support, like directory renaming or symlinks
* make edits to existing files (don&#039;t work on your Git repository or run `vim` in Mountpoint üòÑ)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 does not implement all the features of a POSIX file system, and there are some differences that may affect compatibility with your application. See [Mountpoint file system behavior](doc/SEMANTICS.md) for a detailed description of Mountpoint for Amazon S3&#039;s behavior and POSIX support and how they could affect your application.
To troubleshoot file operations that may not be supported by Mountpoint, see the [troubleshooting documentation](doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Current status

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is generally available! We&#039;re tracking future feature development on the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/84). We&#039;re always interested in feedback on features, performance, and compatibility. Please send feedback by [opening a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues/new/choose) or adding your input to an existing roadmap issue.

### Notices

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Mountpoint for Amazon S3 v1.4.0, released on January 26, 2024, contains an [issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/751) that causes intermittent read failures. We recommend that customers using v1.4.0 upgrade to v1.4.1 or later.

## Getting started

Run these two commands to install Mountpoint for Amazon S3 on your Amazon Linux EC2 instance (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.rpm
    sudo yum install -y ./mount-s3.rpm

On Ubuntu, use these commands instead (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.deb
    sudo apt-get install -y ./mount-s3.deb

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Installing Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions and other installation options, including the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/s3-csi.html) for Kubernetes applications, or building from source.

Once you&#039;ve got Mountpoint for Amazon S3 installed, you can mount your Amazon S3 bucket.
You&#039;ll need valid AWS credentials to access your bucket.
Mountpoint will automatically use credentials from [an IAM role associated with your EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html),
or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables,
or from [several other sources](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md#aws-credentials).

To mount your bucket, run this command,
replacing `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` with the name of your bucket
and `/path/to/mount` with the directory you want to mount the bucket to:

    mount-s3 amzn-s3-demo-bucket /path/to/mount

Now you can work with your bucket contents as if they were a local file system:

    ls /path/to/mount
    echo &quot;Hello World!&quot; &gt; /path/to/mount/Data.txt
    cat /path/to/mount/Data.txt

When you&#039;re finished accessing your bucket, you can unmount it (you might need `sudo`):

    umount /path/to/mount

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Configuring Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md) for more details on how to configure and use Mountpoint.

### Compatibility with other storage services

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is designed for high-performance access to the Amazon S3 service. While it may be functional against other storage services that use S3-like APIs, we aren&#039;t able to provide support for those use cases, and they may inadvertently break when we make changes to better support Amazon S3. We welcome contributions of minor compatibility fixes or performance improvements for these services if the changes can be tested against Amazon S3.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Mountpoint for Amazon S3! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](doc/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to report bugs or submit pull requests. We especially welcome contributions to issues tagged as [good first issues to work on](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT3` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. üñºÔ∏è or üìÑ =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

sccache - Shared Compilation Cache
==================================

sccache is a [ccache](https://ccache.dev/)-like compiler caching tool. It is used as a compiler wrapper and avoids compilation when possible, storing cached results either on [local disk](docs/Local.md) or in one of [several cloud storage backends](#storage-options).

sccache includes support for caching the compilation of C/C++ code, [Rust](docs/Rust.md), as well as NVIDIA&#039;s CUDA using [nvcc](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html), and [clang](https://llvm.org/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.html).

sccache also provides [icecream](https://github.com/icecc/icecream)-style distributed compilation (automatic packaging of local toolchains) for all supported compilers (including Rust). The distributed compilation system includes several security features that icecream lacks such as authentication, transport layer encryption, and sandboxed compiler execution on build servers. See [the distributed quickstart](docs/DistributedQuickstart.md) guide for more information.

sccache is also available as a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sccache-action) to facilitate the deployment using GitHub Actions cache.

## Installation

There are prebuilt x86-64 binaries available for Windows, Linux (a portable binary compiled against musl), and macOS [on the releases page](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/releases/latest). Several package managers also include sccache packages, you can install the latest release from source using cargo, or build directly from a source checkout.

### macOS

On macOS sccache can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install sccache
```

or via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/):

```bash
sudo port install sccache
```

### Windows

On Windows, sccache can be installed via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```
scoop install sccache
```

### Via cargo

If you have a Rust toolchain installed you can install sccache using cargo. **Note that this will compile sccache from source which is fairly resource-intensive. For CI purposes you should use prebuilt binary packages.**


```bash
cargo install sccache --locked
```

---

Usage
-----

Running sccache is like running ccache: prefix your compilation commands with it, like so:

```bash
sccache gcc -o foo.o -c foo.c
```

If you want to use sccache for caching Rust builds you can define `build.rustc-wrapper` in the
[cargo configuration file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html).  For example, you can set it globally
in `$HOME/.cargo/config.toml` by adding:

```toml
[build]
rustc-wrapper = &quot;/path/to/sccache&quot;
```

Note that you need to use cargo 1.40 or newer for this to work.

Alternatively you can use the environment variable `RUSTC_WRAPPER`:

```bash
export RUSTC_WRAPPER=/path/to/sccache
cargo build
```

sccache supports gcc, clang, MSVC, rustc, [NVCC](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html), [NVC++](https://docs.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk//compilers/hpc-compilers-user-guide/index.html), and [Wind River&#039;s diab compiler](https://www.windriver.com/products/development-tools/#diab_compiler). Both gcc and msvc support Response Files, read more about their implementation [here](docs/ResponseFiles.md).

If you don&#039;t [specify otherwise](#storage-options), sccache will use a local disk cache.

sccache works using a client-server model, where the server runs locally on the same machine as the client. The client-server model allows the server to be more efficient by keeping some state in memory. The sccache command will spawn a server process if one is not already running, or you can run `sccache --start-server` to start the background server process without performing any compilation.

By default sccache server will listen on `127.0.0.1:4226`, you can specify environment variable `SCCACHE_SERVER_PORT` to use a different port or `SCCACHE_SERVER_UDS` to listen on unix domain socket. Abstract unix socket is also supported as long as the path is escaped following the [format](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ascii/fn.escape_default.html). For example:

```
% env SCCACHE_SERVER_UDS=$HOME/sccache.sock sccache --start-server # unix socket
% env SCCACHE_SERVER_UDS=\\x00sccache.sock sccache --start-server # abstract unix socket
```

You can run `sccache --stop-server` to terminate the server. It will also terminate after (by default) 10 minutes of inactivity.

Running `sccache --show-stats` will print a summary of cache statistics.

Some notes about using `sccache` with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) are [here](docs/Jenkins.md).

To use sccache with cmake, provide the following command line arguments to cmake 3.4 or newer:

```
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache
```

The process for using sccache with MSVC and cmake, depends on which version of cmake you&#039;re using. **For versions of cmake 3.24 and earlier**, to generate PDB files for debugging with MSVC, you can use the [`/Z7` option](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format?view=msvc-160). Alternatively, the `/Zi` option together with `/Fd` can work if `/Fd` names a different PDB file name for each object file created. Note that CMake sets `/Zi` by default, so if you use CMake, you can use `/Z7` by adding code like this in your CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL &quot;Debug&quot;)
  string(REPLACE &quot;/Zi&quot; &quot;/Z7&quot; CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG &quot;${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG}&quot;)
  string(REPLACE &quot;/Zi&quot; &quot;/Z7&quot; CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG &quot;${CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG}&quot;)
elseif(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL &quot;Release&quot;)
  string(REPLACE &quot;/Zi&quot; &quot;/Z7&quot; CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE &quot;${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE}&quot;)
  string(REPLACE &quot;/Zi&quot; &quot;/Z7&quot; CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE &quot;${CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE}&quot;)
elseif(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL &quot;RelWithDebInfo&quot;)
  string(REPLACE &quot;/Zi&quot; &quot;/Z7&quot; CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO &quot;${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO}&quot;)
  string(REPLACE &quot;/Zi&quot; &quot;/Z7&quot; CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO &quot;${CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO}&quot;)
endif()
```

By default, sccache will fail your build if it fails to successfully communicate with its associated server. To have sccache instead gracefully failover to the local compiler without stopping, set the environment variable `SCCACHE_IGNORE_SERVER_IO_ERROR=1`.

**For versions of cmake 3.25 and later**, to compile with MSVC, you have to use the new `CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` option, meant to configure the `-Z7` flag.  Additionally, you must set the cmake policy number 0141 to the NEW setting:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT Embedded)
cmake_policy(SET CMP0141 NEW)
```

Example configuration where we automatically look for `sccache` in the `PATH`:
```cmake
find_program(SCCACHE sccache REQUIRED)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER ${SCCACHE})
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER ${SCCACHE})
set(CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT Embedded)
cmake_policy(SET CMP0141 NEW)
```

Alternatively, if configuring cmake with MSVC on the command line, assuming that sccache is on the default search path:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache -DCMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT=Embedded -DCMAKE_POLICY_CMP0141=NEW [...]
```

And you can build code as usual without any additional flags in the command line, which is useful for IDEs.


---

Build Requirements
------------------

sccache is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) program. Building it requires `cargo` (and thus`rustc`). sccache currently requires **Rust 1.75.0**. We recommend you install Rust via [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Build
-----

If you are building sccache for non-development purposes make sure you use `cargo build --release` to get optimized binaries:

```bash
cargo build --release [--no-default-features --features=s3|redis|gcs|memcached|azure|gha|webdav|oss]
```

The list of features can be found in the `Cargo.toml` file, `[features]` section.

By default, `sccache` builds with support for all storage backends, but individual backends may be disabled by resetting the list of features and enabling all the other backends. Refer the [Cargo Documentation](http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html#the-features-section) for details on how to select features with Cargo.

### Building portable binaries

When building with the `dist-server` feature, `sccache` will depend on OpenSSL, which can be an annoyance if you want to distribute portable binaries. It is possible to statically link against OpenSSL using the `openssl/vendored` feature.

#### Linux

Build with `cargo` and use `ldd` to check that the resulting binary does not depend on OpenSSL anymore.

#### macOS

Build with `cargo` and use `otool -L` to check that the resulting binary does not depend on OpenSSL anymore.

#### Windows

On Windows, the binary might also depend on a few MSVC CRT DLLs that are not available on older Windows versions.

It is possible to statically link against the CRT using a `.cargo/config.toml` file with the following contents.

```toml
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
rustflags = [&quot;-Ctarget-feature=+crt-static&quot;]
```

Build with `cargo` and use `dumpbin /dependents` to check that the resulting binary does not depend on MSVC CRT DLLs anymore.

When statically linking with OpenSSL, you will need Perl available in your `$PATH`.

---

Separating caches between invocations
-------------------------------------

In situations where several different compilation invocations
should not reuse the cached results from each other,
one can set `SCCACHE_C_CUSTOM_CACHE_BUSTER` to a unique value
that&#039;ll be mixed into the hash.
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` and `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` variables
already exhibit such reuse-suppression behaviour.
There are currently no such variables for compiling Rust.

---

Overwriting the cache
---------------------

In situations where the cache contains broken build artifacts, it can be necessary to overwrite the contents in the cache. That can be achieved by setting the `SCCACHE_RECACHE` environment variable.

---

Debugging
---------

You can set the `SCCACHE_ERROR_LOG` environment variable to a path and set `SCCACHE_LOG` to get the server process to redirect its logging there (including the output of unhandled panics, since the server sets `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` internally).

    SCCACHE_ERROR_LOG=/tmp/sccache_log.txt SCCACHE_LOG=debug sccache

You can also set these environment variables for your build system, for example

    SCCACHE_ERROR_LOG=/tmp/sccache_log.txt SCCACHE_LOG=debug cmake --build /path/to/cmake/build/directory

Alternatively, if you are compiling locally, you can run the server manually in foreground mode by running `SCCACHE_START_SERVER=1 SCCACHE_NO_DAEMON=1 sccache`, and send logging to stderr by setting the [`SCCACHE_LOG` environment variable](https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/#enabling-logging) for example. This method is not suitable for CI services because you need to compile in another shell at the same time.

    SCCACHE_LOG=debug SCCACHE_START_SERVER=1 SCCACHE_NO_DAEMON=1 sccache

---

Interaction with GNU `make` jobserver
-------------------------------------

sccache provides support for a [GNU make jobserver](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Job-Slots.html). When the server is started from a process that provides a jobserver, sccache will use that jobserver and provide it to any processes it spawns. (If you are running sccache from a GNU make recipe, you will need to prefix the command with `+` to get this behavior.) If the sccache server is started without a jobserver present it will create its own with the number of slots equal to the number of available CPU cores.

This is most useful when using sccache for Rust compilation, as rustc supports using a jobserver for parallel codegen, so this ensures that rustc will not overwhelm the system with codegen tasks. Cargo implements its own jobserver ([see the information on `NUM_JOBS` in the cargo documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-build-scripts)) for rustc to use, so using sccache for Rust compilation in cargo via `RUSTC_WRAPPER` should do the right thing automatically.

---

Known Caveats
-------------

### General

* Absolute paths to files must match to get a cache hit. This means that even if you are using a shared cache, everyone will have to build at the same absolute path (i.e. not in `$HOME`) in order to benefit each other. In Rust this includes the source for third party crates which are stored in `$HOME/.cargo/registry/cache` by default.

### Rust

* Crates that invoke the system linker cannot be cached. This includes `bin`, `dylib`, `cdylib`, and `proc-macro` crates. You may be able to improve compilation time of large `bin` crates by converting them to a `lib` crate with a thin `bin` wrapper.
* Incrementally compiled crates cannot be cached. By default, in the debug profile Cargo will use incremental compilation for workspace members and path dependencies. [You can disable incremental compilation.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#incremental)

[More details on Rust caveats](/docs/Rust.md)

### Symbolic links

* Symbolic links to sccache won&#039;t work. Use hardlinks: `ln sccache /usr/local/bin/cc`

### User Agent

* Requests sent to your storage option of choice will have a user agent header indicating the current sccache version, e.g. `sccache/0.8.2`.
