## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust&#039;s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on
correctly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
&gt; the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
&gt; We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

Install optional dependencies as &#039;extras&#039; for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):

```bash
pip install -U &quot;nautilus_trader[docker,ib]&quot;
```

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |

**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.
Skipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, in

Pyrefly is a type checker and language server for Python, which provides
lightning-fast type checking along with IDE features such as code navigation,
semantic highlighting, and code completion. It is available as a
[command-line tool](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/installation/) and an extension
for popular IDEs and editors such as
[VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly),
[Neovim](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/#neovim),
[Zed](https://zed.dev/extensions/pyrefly), and
[more](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/).

See the [Pyrefly website](https://pyrefly.org) for full documentation and how to
add Pyrefly to your editor of choice.

Currently under active development with known issues. Please open an issue if
you find bugs.

### Getting Started

- Try out pyrefly in your browser: [Sandbox](https://pyrefly.org/sandbox/)
- Get the command-line tool: `pip install pyrefly`
- Get the IDE Extension: [IDE installation page](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/)

### Key Features:

- Type Inference: Pyrefly infers types in most locations, apart from function
  parameters. It can infer types of variables and return types.
- Flow Types: Pyrefly can understand your program&#039;s control flow to refine
  static types.
- Incrementality: Pyrefly aims for large-scale incrementality at the module
  level, with optimized checking and parallelism.

and types. This is also where we hold biweekly office hours.

## Choices

There are a number of choices when writing a Python type checker. We are taking
inspiration from [Pyre1](https://pyre-check.org/),
[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) and
[MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Some notable choices:

- We infer types in most locations, apart from parameters to functions. We do
  infer types of variables and return types. As an example,
  `def foo(x): return True` would result in something equivalent to had you
  written `def foo(x: Any) -&gt; bool: ...`.
- We attempt to infer the type of `[]` to however it is used first, then fix it
  after. For example `xs = []; xs.append(1); xs.append(&quot;&quot;)` will infer that
  `xs: List[int]` and then error on the final statement.
- We use flow types which refine static types, e.g. `x: int = 4` will both know
  that `x` has type `int`, but also that the immediately next usage of `x` will
  be aware the type is `Literal[4]`.
- We aim for large-scale incrementality (at the module level) and optimized
  checking with parallelism, aiming to use the advantages of Rust to keep the
  code a bit simpler.
- We expect large strongly connected components of modules, and do not attempt
  to take advantage of a DAG-shape in the source code.

## Code layout

Pyrefly is split into a number of crates (mostly under `crates/`):

- `pyrefly_util` are general purpose utilities, which have nothing to do with
  Python or type checking. Examples include IO wrappers, locking, command line
  helpers etc.
- `pyrefly_derive` are proc-macros for deriving traits such as `TypeEq` and
  `Visit`.
- `pyrefly_python` are Python utilities with no type-checking aspects, such as
  modelling modules or `sys.info`.
- `pyrefly_graph` provides utilities for indexing values and caching
  computations that may depend on each other.
- `pyrefly_bundled` are the third-party
  [typeshed stubs](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
- `pyrefly_config` defines the Pyrefly configuration, along with support for
  reading Mypy/Pyright configuration.
- `pyrefly_types` defines the Pyrefly type along with operations on it.
- `pyrefly_wasm` defines the sandbox code that compiles to WASM.
- `pyrefly` itself is the type checker and everything else.

## Design

There are many nuances of design that change on a regular basis. But the basic
substrate on which the checker is built involves three steps:

1. Figure out what each module exports. That requires solving all `import *`
   statements transitively.
2. For each module in isolation, convert it to bindings, dealing with all
   statements and scope information (both static and flow).
3. Solve those bindings, which may require the solutions of bindings in other
   modules.

If we encounter unknowable information (e.g. recursion) we use `Type::Var` to
insert placeholders which are filled in later.

For each module, we solve the steps sequentially and completely. In particular,
we do not try and solve a specific identifier first (like
[Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)), and do not use fine-grained
incrementality (like [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
using [Salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa)). Instead, we aim for raw
performance and a simpler module-centric design - there&#039;s no need to solve a
single binding in isolation if solving all bindings in a module is fast enough.

### Example of bindings

Given the program:

```python
1: x: int = 4
2: print(x)
```

We might produce the bindings:

- `define int@0` = `from builtins import int`
- `define x@1` = `4: int@0`
- `use x@2` = `x@1`
- `anon @2` = `print(x@2)`
- `export x` = `x@2`

Of note:

- The keys are things like `define` (the definition of something), `use` (a
  usage of a thing) and `anon` (a statement we need to type check, but don&#039;t
  care about the result of).
- In many cases the value of a key refers to other keys.
- Some keys are imported from other modules, via `export` keys and `import`
  values.
- In order to disambiguate identifiers we use the textual position at which they
  occur (in the example we&#039;ve used `@line`, but in reality it&#039;s the byte offset
  in the file).

### Example of `Var`

Given the program:

```python
1: x = 1
2: while test():
3:     x = x
4: print(x)
```

We end up with the bindings:

- `x@1` = `1`
- `x@3` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`
- `x@4` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`

The expression `phi` is the join point of the two values, e.g. `phi(int, str)`
would be `int | str`. We skip the distinction between `define` and `use`, since
it is not necessary for this example.

When solving `x@3` we encounter recursion. Operationally:

- We start solving `x@3`.
- That requires us to solve `x@1`.
- We solve `x@1` to be `Literal[1]`
- We start solving `x@3`. But we are currently solving `x@3`, so we invent a
  fresh `Var` (let&#039;s call it `?1`) and return that.
- We conclude that `x@3` must be `Literal[1] | ?1`.
- Since `?1` was introduced by `x@3` we record that `?1 = Literal[1] | ?1`. We
  can take the upper reachable bound of that and conclude that
  `?1 = Literal[1]`.
- We simplify `x@3` to just `Literal[1]`.

# Leptos

```rust
use leptos::*;

#[component]
pub fn SimpleCounter(initial_value: i32) -&gt; impl IntoView {
    // create a reactive signal with the initial value
    let (value, set_value) = signal(initial_value);

    // create event handlers for our buttons
    // note that `value` and `set_value` are `Copy`, so it&#039;s super easy to move them into closures
    let clear = move |_| set_value(0);
    let decrement = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value -= 1);
    let increment = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value += 1);

    // create user interfaces with the declarative `view!` macro
    view! {
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;button on:click=clear&gt;Clear&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;button on:click=decrement&gt;-1&lt;/button&gt;
            // text nodes can be quoted or unquoted
            &lt;span&gt;&quot;Value: &quot; {value} &quot;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;button on:click=increment&gt;+1&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    }
}

// we also support a builder syntax rather than the JSX-like `view` macro
#[component]
pub fn SimpleCounterWithBuilder(initial_value: i32) -&gt; impl IntoView {
    use leptos::html::*;

    let (value, set_value) = signal(initial_value);
    let clear = move |_| set_value(0);
    let decrement = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value -= 1);
    let increment = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value += 1);

    // the `view` macro above expands to this builder syntax
    div().child((
        button().on(ev::click, clear).child(&quot;Clear&quot;),
        button().on(ev::click, decrement).child(&quot;-1&quot;),
        span().child((&quot;Value: &quot;, value, &quot;!&quot;)),
        button().on(ev::click, increment).child(&quot;+1&quot;)
    ))
}

// Easy to use with Trunk (trunkrs.dev) or with a simple wasm-bindgen setup
pub fn main() {
    mount_to_body(|| view! {
        &lt;SimpleCounter initial_value=3 /&gt;
    })
}
```

## About the Framework

Leptos is a full-stack, isomorphic Rust web framework leveraging fine-grained reactivity to build declarative user interfaces.

## What does that mean?

- **Full-stack**: Leptos can be used to build apps that run in the browser (client-side rendering), on the server (server-side rendering), or by rendering HTML on the server and then adding interactivity in the browser (server-side rendering with hydration). This includes support for HTTP streaming of both data ([`Resource`s](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/prelude/struct.Resource.html)) and HTML (out-of-order or in-order streaming of [`&lt;Suspense/&gt;`](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/suspense/fn.Suspense.html) components.)
- **Isomorphic**: Leptos provides primitives to write isomorphic [server functions](https://docs.rs/server_fn/latest/server_fn/), i.e., functions that can be called with the “same shape” on the client or server, but only run on the server. This means you can write your server-only logic (database requests, authentication etc.) alongside the client-side components that will consume it, and call server functions as if they were running in the browser, without needing to create and maintain a separate REST or other API.
- **Web**: Leptos is built on the Web platform and Web standards. The [router](https://docs.rs/leptos_router/latest/leptos_router/) is designed to use Web fundamentals (like links and forms) and build on top of them rather than trying to replace them.
- **Framework**: Leptos provides most of what you need to build a modern web app: a reactive system, templating library, and a router that works on both the server and client side.
- **Fine-grained reactivity**: The entire framework is built from reactive primitives. This allows for extremely performant code with minimal overhead: when a reactive signal’s value changes, it can update a single text node, toggle a single class, or remove an element from the DOM without any other code running. (So, no virtual DOM overhead!)
- **Declarative**: Tell Leptos how you want the page to look, and let the framework tell the browser how to do it.

## `cargo-leptos`

[`cargo-leptos`](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos) is a build tool that&#039;s designed to make it easy to build apps that run on both the client and the server, with seamless integration. The best way to get started with a real Leptos project right now is to use `cargo-leptos` and our starter templates for [Actix](https://github.com/leptos-rs/start) or [Axum](https://github.com/leptos-rs/start-axum).

```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos --locked
cargo leptos new --git https://github.com/leptos-rs/start-axum
cd [your project name]
cargo leptos watch
```

## FAQs

### What’s up with the name?

_Leptos_ (λεπτός) is an ancient Greek word meaning “thin, light, refined, fine-grained.” To me, a classicist and not a dog owner, it evokes the lightweight reactive system that powers the framework. I&#039;ve since learned the same word is at the root of the medical term “leptospirosis,” a blood infection that affects humans and animals... My bad. No dogs were harmed in the creation of this framework.

### Is it production ready?

People usually mean one of three things by this question.

1. **Are the APIs stable?** i.e., will I have to rewrite my whole app from Leptos 0.1 to 0.2 to 0.3 to 0.4, or can I write it now and benefit from new features and updates as new versions come?

The APIs are basically settled. We’re adding new features, but we’re very happy with where the type system and patterns have landed. I would not expect major breaking changes to your code to adapt to future releases, in terms of architecture.

2. **Are there bugs?**

Yes, I’m sure there are. You can see from the state of our issue tracker over time that there aren’t that _many_ bugs and they’re usually resolved pretty quickly. But for sure, there may be moments where you encounter something that requires a fix at the framework level, which may not be immediately resolved.

3. **Am I a consumer or a contributor?**

This may be the big one: “production ready” implies a certain orientation to a library: that you can basically use it, without any special knowledge of its internals or ability to contribute. Everyone has this at some level in their stack: for example I (@gbj) don’t have the capacity or knowledge to contribute to something like `wasm-bindgen` at this point: I simply rely on it to work.

There are several people in the community using Leptos right now for many websites at work, who have also become significant contributors. There may be missing features that you need, and you may end up building them! But, if you&#039;re willing to contribute a few missing pieces along the way, the framework is most definitely usable for production applications, especially given the ecosystem of libraries that have sprung up around it.

### Can I use this for native GUI?

Sure! Obviously the `view` macro is for generating DOM nodes but you can use the reactive system to drive any native GUI toolkit that uses the same kind of object-oriented, event-callback-based framework as the DOM pretty easily. The principles are the same:

- Use signals, derived signals, and memos to create your reactive system
- Create GUI widgets
- Use event listeners to update signals
- Create effects to update the UI

The 0.7 update originally set out to create a &quot;generic rendering&quot; approach that would allow us to reuse most of the same view logic to do all of the above. Unfortunately, this has had to be shelved for now due to difficulties encountered by the Rust compiler when building larger-scale applications with the number of generics spread throughout the codebase that this required. It&#039;s an approach I&#039;m looking forward to exploring again in the future; feel free to reach out if you&#039;re interested in this kind of work.

### How is this different from Yew?

Yew is the most-used library for Rust web UI development, but there are several differences between Yew and Leptos, in philosophy, approach, and performance.

- **VDOM vs. fine-grained:** Yew is built on the virtual DOM (VDOM) model: state changes cause components to re-render, generating a new virtual DOM tree. Yew diffs this against the previous VDOM, and applies those patches to the actual DOM. Component functions rerun whenever state changes. Leptos takes an entirely different approach. Components run once, creating (and returning) actual DOM nodes and setting up a reactive system to update those DOM nodes.
- **Performance:** This has huge performance implications: Leptos is simply much faster at both creating and updating the UI than Yew is.
- **Server integration:** Yew was created in an era in which browser-rendered single-page apps (SPAs) were the dominant paradigm. While Leptos supports client-side rendering, it also focuses on integrating with the server side of your application via server functions and multiple modes of serving HTML, including out-of-order streaming.

### How is this different from Dioxus?

Like Leptos, Dioxus is a framework for building UIs using web technologies. However, there are significant differences in approach and features.

- **VDOM vs. fine-grained:** While Dioxus has a performant virtual DOM (VDOM), it still uses coarse-grained/component-scoped reactivity: changing a stateful value reruns the component function and diffs the old UI against the new one. Leptos components use a different mental model, creating (and returning) actual DOM nodes and setting up a reactive system to update those DOM nodes.
- **Web vs. desktop priorities:** Dioxus uses Leptos server functions in its fullstack mode, but does not have the same `&lt;Suspense&gt;`-based support for things like streaming HTML rendering, or share the same focus on holistic web performance. Leptos tends to prioritize holistic web performance (streaming HTML rendering, smaller WASM binary sizes, etc.), whereas Dioxus has an unparalleled experience when building desktop apps, because your application logic runs as a native Rust binary.

### How is this different from Sycamore?

Sycamore and Leptos are both heavily influenced by SolidJS. At this point, Leptos has a larger community and ecosystem and is more actively developed. Other differences:

- **Templating DSLs:** Sycamore uses a custom templating language for its views, while Leptos uses a JSX-like template format.
- **`&#039;static` signals:** One of Leptos’s main innovations was the creation of `Copy + &#039;static` signals, which have excellent ergonomics. Sycamore is in the process of adopting the same pattern, but this is not yet released.
- **Perseus vs. server functions:** The Perseus metaframework provides an opinionated way to build Sycamore apps that include server functionality. Leptos instead provides primitives like server functions in the core of the framework.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio&#039;s zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust&#039;s ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system&#039;s event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc.).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

[net]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html
[scheduler]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you enable the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1.49.0&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&amp;mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(0) =&gt; return,
                    Ok(n) =&gt; n,
                    Err(e) =&gt; {
                        eprintln!(&quot;failed to read from socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&amp;buf[0..n]).await {
                    eprintln!(&quot;failed to write to socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Supported Rust Versions

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- tokio/README.md
- tokio/Cargo.toml
- tokio-util/Cargo.toml
- tokio-test/Cargo.toml
- tokio-stream/Cargo.toml
--&gt;

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.71.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.48 to now  - Rust 1.71
 * 1.39 to 1.47 - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn&#039;t follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

 * `1.43.x` - LTS release until March 2026. (MSRV 1.70)
 * `1.47.x` - LTS release until September 2026. (MSRV 1.70)

Each LTS release will continue to receive backported fixes for at least a year.
If you wish to use a fixed minor release in your project, we recommend that you
use an LTS release.

To use a fixed minor version, you can specify the version with a tilde. For
example, to specify that you wish to use the newest `1.43.x` patch release, you
can use the following dependency specification:
```text
tokio = { version = &quot;~1.43&quot;, features = [...] }
```

### Previous LTS releases

 * `1.8.x` - LTS release until February 2022.
 * `1.14.x` - LTS release until June 2022.
 * `1.18.x` - LTS release until June 2023.
 * `1.20.x` - LTS release until September 2023.
 * `1.25.x` - LTS release until March 2024.
 * `1.32.x` - LTS release until September 2024.
 * `1.36.x` - LTS release until March 2025.
 * `1.38.x` - LTS release until July 2025.

## About

Turso Database is an in-process SQL database written in Rust, compatible with SQLite.

&gt; **⚠️ Warning:** This software is in BETA. It may still contain bugs and unexpected behavior. Use caution with production data and ensure you have backups.

## Features and Roadmap

* **SQLite compatibility** for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API [see [document](COMPAT.md) for details]
* **Change data capture (CDC)** for real-time tracking of database changes.
* **Multi-language support** for
  * [Go](bindings/go)
  * [JavaScript](bindings/javascript)
  * [Java](bindings/java)
  * [Python](bindings/python)
  * [Rust](bindings/rust)
  * [WebAssembly](bindings/javascript)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **Cross-platform** support for Linux, macOS, Windows and browsers (through WebAssembly)
* **Vector support** support including exact search and vector manipulation
* **Improved schema management** including extended `ALTER` support and faster schema changes.

The database has the following experimental features:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput using multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
* **Encryption at rest** for protecting the data locally.
* **Incremental computation** using DBSP for incremental view maintenance and query subscriptions.
* **Full-Text-Search** powered by the awesome [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) library

The following features are on our current roadmap:

* **Vector indexing** for fast approximate vector search, similar to [libSQL vector search](https://turso.tech/vector).

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the interactive shell:

```shell
$ tursodb
```

This will start the Turso interactive shell where you can execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```

If you like docker, we got you covered. Simply run this in the root folder:

```bash
make docker-cli-build &amp;&amp; \
make docker-cli-run
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/database
```

Example usage:

```js
import { connect } from &#039;@tursodatabase/database&#039;;

const db = await connect(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
uv pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦫 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
go get turso.tech/database/tursogo
go install turso.tech/database/tursogo
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;turso.tech/database/tursogo&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;turso&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;☕️ Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Turso Database into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Turso Database with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🤖 MCP Server Mode&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


The Turso CLI includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your databases.

Start the MCP server with:

```shell
tursodb your_database.db --mcp
```

### Configuration

Add Turso to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;turso&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/.turso/tursodb&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/your/database.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides nine tools for database interaction:

1. **`open_database`** - Open a new database
2. **`current_database`** - Describe the current database
3. **`list_tables`** - List all tables in the database
4. **`describe_table`** - Describe the structure of a specific table
5. **`execute_query`** - Execute read-only SELECT queries
6. **`insert_data`** - Insert new data into tables
7. **`update_data`** - Update existing data in tables
8. **`delete_data`** - Delete data from tables
9. **`schema_change`** - Execute schema modification statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant:

- &quot;Show me all tables in the database&quot;
- &quot;What&#039;s the schema for the users table?&quot;
- &quot;Find all posts with more than 100 upvotes&quot;
- &quot;Insert a new user with name &#039;Alice&#039; and email &#039;alice@example.com&#039;&quot;

### MCP Clients

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Code&lt;/summary&gt;

If you&#039;re using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), you can easily connect to your Turso MCP server using the built-in MCP management commands:

#### Quick Setup

1. **Add the MCP server** to Claude Code:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to activate the connection

3. **Start querying** your database through natural language!

#### Command Breakdown

```bash
claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
#              ↑            ↑       ↑                           ↑
#              |            |       |                           |
#              Name         |       Database path               MCP flag
#                          Separator
```

- **`my-database`** - Choose any name for your MCP server
- **`--`** - Required separator between Claude options and your command
- **`tursodb`** - The Turso database CLI
- **`./path/to/your/database.db`** - Path to your SQLite database file
- **`--mcp`** - Enables MCP server mode

#### Example Usage

```bash
# For a local project database
cd /your/project
claude mcp add my-project-db -- tursodb ./data/app.db --mcp

# For an absolute path
claude mcp add analytics-db -- tursodb /Users/you/databases/analytics.db --mcp

# For a specific project (local scope)
claude mcp add project-db --local -- tursodb ./database.db --mcp
```

#### Managing MCP Servers

```bash
# List all configured MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Get details about a specific server
claude mcp get my-database

# Remove an MCP server
claude mcp remove my-database
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Desktop&lt;/summary&gt;

For Claude Desktop, add the configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;turso&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/.turso/tursodb&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;./path/to/your/database.db.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cursor&lt;/summary&gt;

For Cursor, configure MCP in your settings:

1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to Extensions → MCP
3. Add a new server with:
   - **Name**: `turso`
   - **Command**: `/path/to/.turso/tursodb`
   - **Args**: `[&quot;./path/to/your/database.db.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]`

Alternatively, you can add it to your Cursor configuration file directly.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Direct JSON-RPC Usage

The MCP server runs as a single process that handles multiple JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout. Here&#039;s how to interact with it directly:

#### Example with In-Memory Database

```bash
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;schema_change&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 4, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;insert_data&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;Alice&#039;, &#039;alice@example.com&#039;)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;execute_query&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;}}}
EOF
```

#### Example with Existing Database

```bash
# Working with an existing database file
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb mydb.db --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
EOF
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Found a data corruption bug? Get up to $1,000.00

SQLite is loved because it is the most reliable database in the world. The next evolution of SQLite has
to match or surpass this level of reliability. Turso is built with [Deterministic Simulation Testing](testing/simulator/README.md/)
from the ground up, and is also tested by [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com).

Even during Alpha, if you find a bug that leads to a data corruption and demonstrate
how our simulator failed to catch it, you can get up to $1,000.00. As the project matures we will
increase the size of the prize, and the scope of the bugs.

List of rewarded cases:

* B-Tree interior cell replacement issue in btrees with depth &gt;=3 ([#2106](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/issues/2106))
* Don&#039;t allow autovacuum to be flipped on non-empty databases ([#3830](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/pull/3830))

More details [here](https://turso.algora.io).

## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

## Installation

Alacritty can be installed by using various package managers on Linux, BSD,
macOS and Windows.

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Windows can also be downloaded from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

For everyone else, the detailed instructions to install Alacritty can be found
[here](INSTALL.md).

### Requirements

- At least OpenGL ES 2.0
- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)

## Configuration

You can find the documentation for Alacritty&#039;s configuration in `man 5
alacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages
installed.

[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html

Alacritty doesn&#039;t create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the
following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.toml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`
5. `/etc/alacritty/alacritty.toml`

On Windows, the config file will be looked for in:

* `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty&#039;s performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn&#039;t feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it&#039;s just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won&#039;t find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

&gt; **February 2026**: Worktrunk was [released](https://x.com/max_sixty/status/2006077845391724739?s=20) over the holidays, and lots of folks seem to be using it. It&#039;s built with love (there&#039;s no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), &amp; [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg). Please let me know any frictions at all; I&#039;m intensely focused on making Worktrunk excellent, and the biggest gap is understanding how others experience using it.

Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for running AI agents in parallel.

Worktrunk&#039;s three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches. Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows.

Scaling agents becomes trivial. A quick demo:

## Context: git worktrees

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without
supervision, such that it&#039;s possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git&#039;s native
worktree feature give each agent its own working directory, so they don&#039;t step
on each other&#039;s changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new
worktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat
../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.

## Worktrunk makes git worktrees as easy as branches

Worktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template.

&gt; Start with the core commands

**Core commands:**

&lt;table class=&quot;cmd-compare&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Task&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Worktrunk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Plain git&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Switch worktrees&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt switch feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd ../repo.feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Create + start Claude&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt switch -c -x claude feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
cd ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
claude&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Clean up&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt remove&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd ../repo &amp;&amp; \
git worktree remove ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
git branch -d feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;List with status&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt list&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git worktree list&lt;/pre&gt; (paths only)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&gt; Expand into the more advanced commands as needed

**Workflow automation:**

- **[Hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc
- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs
- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- ...and **[lots more](#next-steps)**

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS &amp; Linux):**

```bash
brew install worktrunk &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

Shell integration allows commands to change directories.

**Cargo:**

```bash
cargo install worktrunk &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

On Windows, `wt` defaults to Windows Terminal&#039;s command. Winget additionally installs Worktrunk as `git-wt` to avoid the conflict:

```bash
winget install max-sixty.worktrunk
git-wt config shell install
```

Alternatively, disable Windows Terminal&#039;s alias (Settings → Privacy &amp; security → For developers → App Execution Aliases → disable &quot;Windows Terminal&quot;) to use `wt` directly.

&lt;/details&gt;

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
paru worktrunk-bin &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

## Quick start

Create a worktree for a new feature:

```console
$ wt switch --create feature-auth
✓ Created branch feature-auth from main and worktree @ repo.feature-auth

```

This creates a new branch and worktree, then switches to it. Do your work, then check all worktrees with [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/):

```console
$ wt list
  Branch        Status        HEAD±    main↕  Remote⇅  Commit    Age   Message
@ feature-auth  +   –      +53                         0e631add  1d    Initial commit
^ main              ^⇡                         ⇡1      0e631add  1d    Initial commit

○ Showing 2 worktrees, 1 with changes, 1 column hidden

```

The `@` marks the current worktree. `+` means staged changes, `⇡` means unpushed commits.

When done, either:

**PR workflow** — commit, push, open a PR, merge via GitHub/GitLab, then clean up:

```bash
wt step commit                    # commit staged changes
gh pr create                      # or glab mr create
wt remove                         # after PR is merged
```

**Local merge** — squash, rebase onto main, fast-forward merge, clean up:

```console
$ wt merge main
◎ Generating commit message and committing changes... (2 files, +53, no squashing needed)
  Add authentication module
✓ Committed changes @ a1b2c3d
◎ Merging 1 commit to main @ a1b2c3d (no rebase needed)
  * a1b2c3d Add authentication module
   auth.rs | 51 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   lib.rs  |  2 ++
   2 files changed, 53 insertions(+)
✓ Merged to main (1 commit, 2 files, +53)
◎ Removing feature-auth worktree &amp; branch in background (same commit as main, _)
○ Switched to worktree for main @ repo

```

For parallel agents, create multiple worktrees and launch an agent in each:

```bash
wt switch -x claude -c feature-a -- &#039;Add user authentication&#039;
wt switch -x claude -c feature-b -- &#039;Fix the pagination bug&#039;
wt switch -x claude -c feature-c -- &#039;Write tests for the API&#039;
```

The `-x` flag runs a command after switching; arguments after `--` are passed to it. Configure [post-start hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) to automate setup (install deps, start dev servers).

**The vector database that gets smarter the more you use it — and now ships as a cognitive container.**

```bash
npx ruvector
```

Most vector databases are static — they store embeddings and search them. That&#039;s it. RuVector is different: it learns from every query, runs LLMs locally, scales horizontally, boots as a Linux microservice from a single file, and costs nothing to operate.

| | Pinecone/Weaviate | RuVector |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 **Search improves over time** | ❌ | ✅ The more you search, the better results get |
| 🤖 **Run LLMs locally** | ❌ | ✅ Run AI models on your own machine for free |
| 🔗 **Graph queries** | ❌ | ✅ Ask questions about relationships between data |
| 📚 **Self-learning** | ❌ | ✅ System watches what works and gets smarter |
| 🚀 **Self-booting microservice** | ❌ | ✅ [One file boots into a running service](./crates/rvf/README.md) in 125 ms |
| ⚡ **Real-time graph updates** | ❌ Must rebuild | ✅ Update connections instantly, no downtime |
| 📦 **Single-file deployment** | ❌ Server required | ✅ One file — copy it anywhere and it just works |
| 🔐 **Tamper-proof audit trail** | ❌ | ✅ Every operation is cryptographically recorded |
| 🌐 **Works offline** | ❌ | ✅ Runs in browsers, phones, IoT, and bare metal |
| 💰 **Cost** | Per-query pricing | ✅ Free forever — open source (MIT) |
| 📈 **Scales horizontally** | 💰 Paid tiers | ✅ Add nodes freely, no per-vector fees |
| 🌿 **Git-like branching** | ❌ | ✅ Branch your data like code — only changes are copied |

**One package. Everything included:** vector search, graph queries, GNN learning, distributed clustering, local LLMs, 40+ attention mechanisms, cognitive containers ([RVF](./crates/rvf/README.md) — self-booting `.rvf` files with eBPF, witness chains, and COW branching), and WASM support.

**Using AI to make the world a healthier place.** rvDNA puts genomic diagnostics on any device — a phone, a laptop, a browser tab — in 12 milliseconds. No cloud, no GPU, no subscription. Private by default.

```bash
cargo add rvdna              # Rust

- **Source**: [examples/dna](./examples/dna)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RVF Cognitive Containers&lt;/strong&gt; — One file that stores, boots, and proves everything&lt;/summary&gt;

**[RVF (RuVector Format)](./crates/rvf/README.md)** is a universal binary substrate that merges database, model, graph engine, kernel, and attestation into a single deployable file. A `.rvf` file can store vector embeddings, carry LoRA adapter deltas, embed GNN graph state, include a bootable Linux microkernel, run queries in a 5.5 KB WASM runtime, and prove every operation through a cryptographic witness chain — all in one file that runs anywhere from a browser to bare metal.

This is not a database format. It is an **executable knowledge unit**.

```bash
cargo install rvf-cli                          # CLI tool
cargo add rvf-runtime                          # Rust library
npm install @ruvector/rvf                      # TypeScript SDK
npx @ruvector/rvf-mcp-server --transport stdio # MCP server for AI agents
```

| What It Does | How |
|---|---|
| Self-boot as a microservice | Real Linux kernel in the file, boots in 125 ms on QEMU/KVM |
| Hardware-speed lookups | eBPF programs (XDP, TC, socket filter) bypass userspace entirely |
| Run in any browser | 5.5 KB WASM runtime, zero backend |
| Git-like branching | COW at cluster granularity — 1M vectors, 100 edits = ~2.5 MB child |
| Tamper-evident audit | Hash-linked witness chain for every insert, query, and deletion |
| Post-quantum signatures | ML-DSA-65 and Ed25519 signing on every segment |
| DNA-style lineage | Parent/child derivation chains with cryptographic verification |
| 24 segment types | VEC, INDEX, KERNEL, EBPF, WASM, COW_MAP, WITNESS, CRYPTO, and 16 more |

## How the GNN Works

Traditional vector search:
```
Query → HNSW Index → Top K Results
```

RuVector with GNN:
```
Query → HNSW Index → GNN Layer → Enhanced Results
                ↑                      │
                └──── learns from ─────┘
```

The GNN layer:
1. Takes your query and its nearest neighbors
2. Applies multi-head attention to weigh which neighbors matter
3. Updates representations based on graph structure
4. Returns better-ranked results

Over time, frequently-accessed paths get reinforced, making common queries faster and more accurate.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

## React Template（⚡️）

⚡️ A minimal React Vite starter template.

### Feature

- ⚡️ Fast - Build tools based on vite.
- 👻 Small - Based on the smallest runnable build.
- 💄 Prettier - Integrated Prettier to help you format the code.
- ✅ Safety - Https is enabled by default.
- 😎 Reliable - Integrated eslint and commitlint.
- 🤖 Intelligent - Integrated renovate to help you maintain the dependent version.

### Preview

&lt;/summary&gt;

```toml
[dependencies]

# The core APIs, including the Serialize and Deserialize traits. Always
# required when using Serde. The &quot;derive&quot; feature is only required when
# using #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] to make Serde work with structs
# and enums defined in your crate.
serde = { version = &quot;1.0&quot;, features = [&quot;derive&quot;] }

# Each data format lives in its own crate; the sample code below uses JSON
# but you may be using a different one.
serde_json = &quot;1.0&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

    // Convert the Point to a JSON string.
    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&amp;point).unwrap();

    // Prints serialized = {&quot;x&quot;:1,&quot;y&quot;:2}
    println!(&quot;serialized = {}&quot;, serialized);

    // Convert the JSON string back to a Point.
    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&amp;serialized).unwrap();

    // Prints deserialized = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }
    println!(&quot;deserialized = {:?}&quot;, deserialized);

## Getting help

Serde is one of the most widely used Rust libraries so any place that Rustaceans
congregate will be able to help you out. For chat, consider trying the
[#rust-questions] or [#rust-beginners] channels of the unofficial community
Discord (invite: &lt;https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community&gt;), the [#rust-usage] or
[#beginners] channels of the official Rust Project Discord (invite:
&lt;https://discord.gg/rust-lang&gt;), or the [#general][zulip] stream in Zulip. For
asynchronous, consider the [\[rust\] tag on StackOverflow][stackoverflow], the
[/r/rust] subreddit which has a pinned weekly easy questions post, or the Rust
[Discourse forum][discourse]. It&#039;s acceptable to file a support issue in this
repo but they tend not to get as many eyes as any of the above and may get
closed without a response after some time.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## Stremio - the next generation media center

Stremio is a full-featured media center designed to help you organize and stream your favorite videos, movies and TV series. It will notify you for new episodes / movies, and allow you to find new content through Discover.

Stremio allows, using its [Add-ons system](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk), to play movies, TV series and channels instantly.

## stremio-core

`stremio-core` is a rust crate that&#039;s designed to contain all the reusable logic between Stremio versions.

### Goals

* Flexibility - can be integrated into existing code bases, across the entire stack, and in different paradigms
	* use case: `types` can be used by add-ons
	* use case: can be used with existing user authentication as an addition to an existing app
	* use case: can use the `Context` model to manage the user authentication/addons, using it as a backbone to the entire Stremio app
* Emphasis on correctness
* No cruft / legacy - not burdened by obsolete decisions &amp; solutions

### Modules

* `types`
* `addon_transport` - handles communication with add-ons, implements legacy protocol adapter
* `state_types`: types that describe application state; inspired by the Elm architecture
	* Effects and Update traits
	* `runtime`: helps using `stremio-core` in an application by handling the effects automatically
	* `environment`: a trait describes the environment (fetch, storage)
	* `msg`: messages: actions, events
	* `models`: all stateful models, such as `Context` (handling user authentication, add-ons), `Library`, `CatalogFiltered`, etc.

## Optimizing WASM output

WASM output binary can get large, especially if we derive Serialize/Deserialize in places we don&#039;t need to

We can optimize it by running twiggy: `twiggy top ..._bg.wasm` and seeing what the biggest code size offenders are


## Adding new actions

Defining actions and what middleware requests they should trigger is defined in `src/state_types/msg/actions`

            <h2>README</h2><pre>&gt; **📣 If you were previously using libsignal from Maven or Gradle, our repository location has changed with the 0.86.6 release. See below for more information.**

# Overview

libsignal contains platform-agnostic APIs used by the official Signal clients and servers, exposed
as a Java, Swift, or TypeScript library. The underlying implementations are written in Rust:

- libsignal-protocol: Implements the Signal protocol, including the [Double Ratchet algorithm][]. A
  replacement for [libsignal-protocol-java][] and [libsignal-metadata-java][].
- signal-crypto: Cryptographic primitives such as AES-GCM. We use [RustCrypto][]&#039;s where we can
  but sometimes have differing needs.
- device-transfer: Support logic for Signal&#039;s device-to-device transfer feature.
- attest: Functionality for remote attestation of [SGX enclaves][] and server-side [HSMs][].
- zkgroup: Functionality for [zero-knowledge groups][] and related features available in Signal.
- zkcredential: An abstraction for the sort of zero-knowledge credentials used by zkgroup, based on the paper &quot;[The Signal Private Group System][]&quot; by Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha.
- poksho: Utilities for implementing zero-knowledge proofs (such as those used by zkgroup); stands for &quot;proof-of-knowledge, stateful-hash-object&quot;.
- account-keys: Functionality for consistently using [PINs][] as passwords in Signal&#039;s Secure Value Recovery system, as well as other account-wide key operations.
- usernames: Functionality for username generation, hashing, and proofs.
- media: Utilities for manipulating media.

This repository is used by the Signal client apps ([Android][], [iOS][], and [Desktop][]) as well as
server-side. Use outside of Signal is unsupported. In particular, the products of this repository
are the Java, Swift, and TypeScript libraries that wrap the underlying Rust implementations. All
APIs and implementations are subject to change without notice, as are the JNI, C, and Node add-on
&quot;bridge&quot; layers. However, backwards-incompatible changes to the Java, Swift, TypeScript, and
non-bridge Rust APIs will be reflected in the version number on a best-effort basis, including

# Building

### Toolchain Installation

To build anything in this repository you must have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed, as well
as recent versions of Clang, libclang, [CMake](https://cmake.org), Make, protoc, Python (3.9+), and git.

#### Linux/Debian

On a Debian-like system, you can get these extra dependencies through `apt`:

```shell
$ apt-get install clang libclang-dev cmake make protobuf-compiler python3 git
```

#### macOS

On macOS, we have a best-effort maintained script to set up the Rust toolchain you can run by:

```shell
$ bin/mac_setup.sh
```

## Rust

### First Build and Test

The build currently uses a specific version of the Rust nightly compiler, which
will be downloaded automatically by cargo. To build and test the basic protocol
libraries:

```shell
$ cargo build
...
$ cargo test
...
```

### Additional Rust Tools

The basic tools above should get you set up for most libsignal Rust development. 

Eventually, you may find that you need some additional Rust tools like `cbindgen` to modify the bridges to the 
client libraries or `taplo` for code formatting. 

You should always install any Rust tools you need that may affect the build from cargo rather than from your system
package manager (e.g. `apt` or `brew`). Package managers sometimes contain outdated versions of these tools that can break
the build with incompatibility issues (especially cbindgen).

To install the main Rust extra dependencies matching the versions we use, you can run the following commands:

```shell
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat .cbindgen-version)&quot; --locked cbindgen
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat acknowledgments/cargo-about-version)&quot; --locked cargo-about
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat .taplo-cli-version)&quot; --locked taplo-cli
$ cargo +stable install cargo-fuzz
```

## Java/Android

### Toolchain Setup / Configuration

To build for Android you must install several additional packages including a JDK,
the Android NDK/SDK, and add the Android targets to the Rust compiler, using

```rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android```

Our officially supported JDK version for Android builds is JDK 17, so be sure to install e.g. OpenJDK 17, and then point JAVA_HOME to it.

You can easily do this on macOS via:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)
```

On Linux, the way you do this varies by distribution. For Debian based distributions like Ubuntu, you can use:

```shell
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

We also check-in a `.tools_version` file for use with runtime version managers.

### Building and Testing

To build the Java/Android ``jar`` and ``aar``, and run the tests:

```shell
$ cd java
$ ./gradlew test
$ ./gradlew build # if you need AAR outputs
```

You can pass `-P debugLevelLogs` to Gradle to build without filtering out debug- and verbose-level
logs from Rust, and `-P jniTypeTagging` to enable additional checks in the Rust JNI bridging code.

Alternately, a build system using Docker is available:

```shell
$ cd java
$ make
```

When exposing new APIs to Java, you will need to run `rust/bridge/jni/bin/gen_java_decl.py` in
addition to rebuilding. This requires installing the `cbindgen` Rust tool, as detailed above. 

### Use as a library

Signal publishes Java packages for its own use, under the names org.signal:libsignal-server,
org.signal:libsignal-client, and org.signal:libsignal-android. libsignal-client and libsignal-server
contain native libraries for Debian-flavored x86_64 Linux as well as Windows (x86_64) and macOS
(x86_64 and arm64). libsignal-android contains native libraries for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and
x86_64 Android. These are located in a Maven repository at
https://build-artifacts.signal.org/libraries/maven/; for use from Gradle, add the following to your
`repositories` block:

```
maven {
  name = &quot;SignalBuildArtifacts&quot;
  // The &quot;uri()&quot; part is only necessary for Kotlin Gradle; Groovy Gradle accepts a bare string here.
  url = uri(&quot;https://build-artifacts.signal.org/libraries/maven/&quot;)
}
```

Older builds were published to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org) instead.

When building for Android you need *both* libsignal-android and libsignal-client, but the Windows
and macOS libraries in libsignal-client won&#039;t automatically be excluded from your final app. You can
explicitly exclude them using `packagingOptions`:

```
android {
  // ...
  packagingOptions {
    resources {
      excludes += setOf(&quot;libsignal_jni*.dylib&quot;, &quot;signal_jni*.dll&quot;)
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

You can additionally exclude `libsignal_jni_testing.so` if you do not plan to use any of the APIs
intended for client testing.


## Swift

To learn about the Swift build process see [``swift/README.md``](swift/)


## Node

You&#039;ll need Node installed to build. If you have [nvm][], you can run `nvm use` to select an
appropriate version automatically.

We use `npm` as our package manager, and a Python script to control building the Rust library, accessible as `npm run build`.

```shell
$ cd node
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run tsc
$ npm run test
```

When testing changes locally, you can use `npm run build` to do an incremental rebuild of the Rust library. Alternately, `npm run build-with-debug-level-logs` will rebuild without filtering out debug- and verbose-level logs.

When exposing new APIs to Node, you will need to run `rust/bridge/node/bin/gen_ts_decl.py` in
addition to rebuilding.

[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

### NPM

Signal publishes the NPM package `@signalapp/libsignal-client` for its own use, including native
libraries for Windows, macOS, and Debian-flavored Linux. Both x64 and arm64 builds are included for
all three platforms, but the arm64 builds for Windows and Linux are considered experimental, since
there are no official builds of Signal for those architectures.


# Contributions

Signal does accept external contributions to this project. However unless the change is
simple and easily understood, for example fixing a bug or portability issue, adding a new
test, or improving performance, first open an issue to discuss your intended change as not
all changes can be accepted.

Contributions that will not be used directly by one of Signal&#039;s official client apps may still be
considered, but only if they do not pose an undue maintenance burden or conflict with the goals of
the project.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cargo

Cargo downloads your Rust project’s dependencies and compiles your project.

**To start using Cargo**, learn more at [The Cargo Book].

**To start developing Cargo itself**, read the [Cargo Contributor Guide].

[The Cargo Book]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
[Cargo Contributor Guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo/contrib/

&gt; The Cargo binary distributed through with Rust is maintained by the Cargo
&gt; team for use by the wider ecosystem.
&gt; For all other uses of this crate (as a binary or library) this is maintained
&gt; by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo and not intended for external
&gt; use (except as a transitive dependency). This crate may make major changes to
&gt; its APIs.

## Code Status

[![CI](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=auto-cargo)](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Code documentation: &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/&gt;

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `cargo` and `rustc`
* A C compiler [for your platform](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)
* `git` (to clone this repository)

**Other requirements:**

The following are optional based on your platform and needs.

* `pkg-config` — This is used to help locate system packages, such as `libssl` headers/libraries. This may not be required in all cases, such as using vendored OpenSSL, or on Windows.
* OpenSSL — Only needed on Unix-like systems and only if the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature is not used.

  This requires the development headers, which can be obtained from the `libssl-dev` package on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` with apk or yum or the `openssl` package from Homebrew on macOS.

  If using the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature, then a static copy of OpenSSL will be built from source instead of using the system OpenSSL.
  This may require additional tools such as `perl` and `make`.

  On macOS, common installation directories from Homebrew, MacPorts, or pkgsrc will be checked. Otherwise it will fall back to `pkg-config`.

  On Windows, the system-provided Schannel will be used instead.

  LibreSSL is also supported.

**Optional system libraries:**

The build will automatically use vendored versions of the following libraries. However, if they are provided by the system and can be found with `pkg-config`, then the system libraries will be used instead:

* [`libcurl`](https://curl.se/libcurl/) — Used for network transfers.
* [`libgit2`](https://libgit2.org/) — Used for fetching git dependencies.
* [`libssh2`](https://www.libssh2.org/) — Used for SSH access to git repositories.
* [`libz`](https://zlib.net/) (AKA zlib) — Used by the above C libraries for data compression. (Rust code uses [`zlib-rs`](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/zlib-rs) instead.)

It is recommended to use the vendored versions as they are the versions that are tested to work with Cargo.

### Compiling

First, you&#039;ll want to check out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo.git
cd cargo
```

With `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.

[third-party-subcommands]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-cargo-subcommands


## Releases

Cargo releases coincide with Rust releases.
High level release notes are available as part of [Rust&#039;s release notes][rel].
Detailed release notes are available in the [changelog].

- Docker (service only, no GUI): See [DOCKER.md](./docs/DOCKER.md)
- Build from source.

Note: Nvidia support requires the Nvidia proprietary driver with CUDA libraries
installed.

## Development builds

To get latest fixes or features that have not yet been released in a stable
version, there are packages built from the latest commit that you can install
from the
[test release](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/test-build)
or using the `lact-git` AUR package on Arch-based distros.

Note: the date that GitHub shows next to the test release is not when the packages were built,
the actual date is specified next to the attached package files.

# Usage

Enable and start the service (otherwise you won&#039;t be able to change any
settings):

```
sudo systemctl enable --now lactd
```

You can now use the GUI to change settings and view information.

# Hardware support

See the
[Wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Hardware-Support)

# Configuration

There is a configuration file available in `/etc/lact/config.yaml`. Most of the
settings are accessible through the GUI, but some of them may be useful to be
edited manually (like `admin_group` and `admin_user` to specify who has access
to the daemon)

See [CONFIG.md](./docs/CONFIG.md) for more information.

**Socket permissions setup:**

By default, LACT uses either ether the `wheel` or `sudo` group (whichever is
available) for the ownership of the unix socket that the GUI needs to connect
to.

On most desktop configurations (such as the default setup on Arch-based, most
Debian-based or Fedora systems) this includes the default user, so you do not
need to configure this.

However, some systems may have different user configuration. In particular, this
has been reported to be a problem on OpenSUSE.

To fix socket permissions in such configurations, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml`
and under the `daemon` section either:

- Set `admin_user` to your username
- Set `admin_group` to a group that your user is a part of Then restart the
  service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

# Overclocking (AMD)

Some functionality requires enabling an option in the amdgpu driver, see the
[wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Overclocking-(AMD)) for
more information.

## Power profiles daemon note!

If you are using `power-profiles-daemon` (which is installed by default on many
distributions), by default it may override the amdgpu performance level setting
according to its own profile.

When using LACT 0.7.5+ and power-profiles-daemon 0.30+, LACT will try to connect to power-profiles-daemon 
and automatically disable the conflicting amdgpu action in ppd to avoid this conflict.

If running older versions, you can resolve this manually by creating a file at
`/etc/systemd/system/power-profiles-daemon.service.d/override.conf` with the
following contents:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/power-profiles-daemon --block-action=amdgpu_dpm
```

Note: the `/usr/libexec` path might be different on your system, check it in
`systemctl status power-profiles-daemon`

See https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/issues/370 for more information.

# Suspend/Resume

As some of the GPU settings may get reset when suspending the system, LACT will
reload them on system resume. This may not work on distributions which don&#039;t use
systemd, as it relies on the `org.freedesktop.login2` DBus interface.

# Building from source

Dependencies:

- rust 1.76+
- gtk 4.6+
- git
- pkg-config
- clang
- make
- hwdata
- libdrm

Optional Dependencies:
- vulkan-tools
- clinfo

Command to install all dependencies:

- Fedora:
  `sudo dnf install rust cargo make git clang gtk4-devel libdrm-devel vulkan-tools clinfo`
- Arch:
  `sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git clang make rust gtk4 hwdata vulkan-tools clinfo`

Steps:

- `git clone https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT &amp;&amp; cd LACT`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`

It&#039;s possible to change which features LACT gets built with. To do so, replace
the `make` command with the following variation:

Headless build with no GUI:

```
make build-release-headless
```

Build GUI with libadwaita support:

```
make build-release-libadwaita
```

# Remote management

It&#039;s possible to have the LACT daemon running on one machine, and then manage it
remotely from another.

This is disabled by default, as the TCP connection **does not have any
authentication or encryption mechanism!** Make sure to only use it in trusted
networks and/or set up appropriate firewall rules.

To enable it, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml` and add `tcp_listen_address` with
your desired address and in the `daemon` section.

Example:

```yaml
daemon:
  tcp_listen_address: 0.0.0.0:12853
  log_level: info
  admin_group: wheel
  disable_clocks_cleanup: false
```

After this restart the service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

To connect to a remote instance with the GUI, run it with
`lact gui --tcp-address 192.168.1.10:12853`.

# CLI

There is also a cli available.

          ```

        - Enable auto switch:

          `lact cli profile auto-switch enable`

          Example output:

          ```
          enabled
          ```

        - Disable auto switch:

          `lact cli profile auto-switch disable`

          Example output:

          ```
          disabled
          ```

The functionality of the CLI is quite limited. If you want to integrate LACT
with some application/script, you should use the [API](./docs/API.md) instead.

# Reporting issues

When reporting issues, please include your system info and GPU model.

If you&#039;re having an issue with changing the GPU&#039;s configuration, it&#039;s highly
recommended to include a debug snapshot in the bug report. You can generate one
using the option in the dropdown menu:

![image](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/assets/22796665/36dda5e3-981b-47e7-914e-6e29f30616b4)

The snapshot is an archive which includes the SysFS that LACT uses to interact
with the GPU.

If there&#039;s a crash, run `lact gui` from the command line to get GUI logs, check
daemon logs in `journalctl -u lactd` for errors, and see `dmesg` for kernel logs
that might include information about driver and system issues.

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
However, note that only commits and files are stored in Git; bookmarks
(branches) and other higher-level metadata are stored in custom storage outside
of Git. All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on
GitHub. But it should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[wcc]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/working-copy/
[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any
questions, or want to talk about future plans, please join us on Discord

start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [colocated local
workspace](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-compatibility#colocated-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results in a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily restore to
an earlier repo state, simply undo your operations one-by-one or even _revert_ a
particular operation which does not have to be the most recent one.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, while Google is one of the main contributors, **this is not a
supported Google product**, i.e. support is provided by the community.
