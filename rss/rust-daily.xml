## Quickstart

To get started with RustFS, follow these steps:

1. **One-click installation script (Option 1)‚Äã‚Äã**

  ```bash
  curl -O  https://rustfs.com/install_rustfs.sh &amp;&amp; bash install_rustfs.sh
  ```

2. **Docker Quick Start (Option 2)‚Äã‚Äã**

  ```bash
   # create data and logs directories
   mkdir -p data logs

   # using latest alpha version
   docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:alpha

   # Specific version
   docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:1.0.0.alpha.45
   ```

For docker installation, you can also run the container with docker compose. With the `docker-compose.yml` file under
root directory, running the command:

  ```
  docker compose --profile observability up -d
  ```

**NOTE**: You should be better to have a look for `docker-compose.yaml` file. Because, several services contains in the
file. Grafan,prometheus,jaeger containers will be launched using docker compose file, which is helpful for rustfs
observability. If you want to start redis as well as nginx container, you can specify the corresponding profiles.

3. **Build from Source (Option 3) - Advanced Users**

   For developers who want to build RustFS Docker images from source with multi-architecture support:

   ```bash
   # Build multi-architecture images locally
   ./docker-buildx.sh --build-arg RELEASE=latest

   # Build and push to registry
   ./docker-buildx.sh --push

   # Build specific version
   ./docker-buildx.sh --release v1.0.0 --push

   # Build for custom registry
   ./docker-buildx.sh --registry your-registry.com --namespace yourname --push
   ```

   The `docker-buildx.sh` script supports:
    - **Multi-architecture builds**: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
    - **Automatic version detection**: Uses git tags or commit hashes
    - **Registry flexibility**: Supports Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.
    - **Build optimization**: Includes caching and parallel builds

   You can also use Make targets for convenience:

   ```bash
   make docker-buildx                    # Build locally
   make docker-buildx-push               # Build and push
   make docker-buildx-version VERSION=v1.0.0  # Build specific version
   make help-docker                      # Show all Docker-related commands
   ```

4. **Access the Console**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000` to access the RustFS console,
   default username and password is `rustfsadmin` .
5. **Create a Bucket**: Use the console to create a new bucket for your objects.
6. **Upload Objects**: You can upload files directly through the console or use S3-compatible APIs to interact with your
   RustFS instance.

**NOTE**: If you want to access RustFS instance with `https`, you can refer
to [TLS configuration docs](https://docs.rustfs.com/integration/tls-configured.html).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Monarch ü¶ã

**Monarch** is a distributed programming framework for PyTorch based on scalable
actor messaging. It provides:

1. Remote actors with scalable messaging: Actors are grouped into collections called meshes and messages can be broadcast to all members.
2. Fault tolerance through supervision trees: Actors and processes form a tree and failures propagate up the tree, providing good default error behavior and enabling fine-grained fault recovery.
3. Point-to-point RDMA transfers: cheap registration of any GPU or CPU memory in a process, with the one-sided transfers based on libibverbs
4. Distributed tensors: actors can work with tensor objects sharded across processes

Monarch code imperatively describes how to create processes and actors using a simple python API:

```python
from monarch.actor import Actor, endpoint, this_host

# spawn 8 trainer processes one for each gpu
training_procs = this_host().spawn_procs({&quot;gpus&quot;: 8})


# define the actor to run on each process
class Trainer(Actor):
    @endpoint
    def train(self, step: int): ...


# create the trainers
trainers = training_procs.spawn(&quot;trainers&quot;, Trainer)

# tell all the trainers to take a step
fut = trainers.train.call(step=0)

# wait for all trainers to complete
fut.get()
```


The [introduction to monarch concepts](https://meta-pytorch.org/monarch/generated/examples/getting_started.html) provides an introduction to using these features.

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development Warning** Monarch is currently in an experimental
&gt; stage. You should expect bugs, incomplete features, and APIs that may change
&gt; in future versions. The project welcomes bugfixes, but to make sure things are
&gt; well coordinated you should discuss any significant change before starting the
&gt; work. It&#039;s recommended that you signal your intention to contribute in the
&gt; issue tracker, either by filing a new issue or by claiming an existing one.

## üìñ Documentation

View Monarch&#039;s hosted documentation [at this link](https://meta-pytorch.org/monarch/).

## Installation
Note for running distributed tensors and RDMA, the local torch version must match the version that monarch was built with.
Stable and nightly distributions require libmxl and libibverbs (runtime).

## Fedora
`sudo dnf install -y libibverbs rdma-core libmlx5 libibverbs-devel rdma-core-devel`

## Ubuntu
`sudo apt install -y rdma-core libibverbs1 libmlx5-1 libibverbs-dev rdma-core-dev`

### Stable

`pip install torchmonarch`

torchmonarch stable is built with the latest stable torch.

### Nightly
`pip install torchmonarch-nightly`

torchmonarch-nightly is built with torch nightly.

### Build and Install from Source

#### On Fedora distributions

```sh

# Create and activate the conda environment
conda create -n monarchenv python=3.10 -y
conda activate monarchenv

# Install nightly rust toolchain
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly

# Install non-python dependencies
conda install libunwind -y

# Install the correct cuda and cuda-toolkit versions for your machine
sudo dnf install cuda-toolkit-12-0 cuda-12-0

# Install clang-dev and nccl-dev
sudo dnf install clang-devel libnccl-devel
# Or, in some environments, the following may be necessary instead
conda install -c conda-forge clangdev nccl
conda update -n monarchenv --all -c conda-forge -y

# If you are building with RDMA support, build monarch with `USE_TENSOR_ENGINE=1 pip install --no-build-isolation .` and dnf install the following packages
sudo dnf install -y libibverbs rdma-core libmlx5 libibverbs-devel rdma-core-devel

# Install build dependencies
pip install -r build-requirements.txt
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r python/tests/requirements.txt

# Build and install Monarch
pip install --no-build-isolation .
# or setup for development
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .

# Verify installation
pip list | grep monarch
```

#### On Ubuntu distributions

```sh
# Clone the repository and navigate to it
git clone https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch.git
cd monarch

# Install nightly rust toolchain
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly

# Install Ubuntu-specific system dependencies
sudo apt install -y ninja-build
sudo apt install -y libunwind-dev

```

#### On MacOS

You can also build Monarch to run locally on a MacOS system.

Note that this does not support tensor engine, which is tied to CUDA and RDMA (via ibverbs).


```sh

# Create and activate the conda environment
conda create -n monarchenv python=3.10 -y
conda activate monarchenv

# Install nightly rust toolchain
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly

# Install build dependencies
pip install -r build-requirements.txt
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r python/tests/requirements.txt

# Build and install Monarch
USE_TENSOR_ENGINE=0 pip install --no-build-isolation .
# or setup for development
USE_TENSOR_ENGINE=0 pip install --no-build-isolation -e .

# Verify installation
pip list | grep monarch
```


## Running examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for demonstrations of how to use Monarch&#039;s APIs.

We&#039;ll be adding more examples as we stabilize and polish functionality!

## Running tests

We have both Rust and Python unit tests. Rust tests are run with `cargo-nextest`
and Python tests are run with `pytest`.

Rust tests:
```sh
# We use cargo-nextest to run our tests, as they can provide strong process isolation
# between every test.
# Here we install it from source, but you can instead use a pre-built binary described
# here: https://nexte.st/docs/installation/pre-built-binaries/
cargo install cargo-nextest --locked
cargo nextest run
```
cargo-nextest supports all of the filtering flags of &quot;cargo test&quot;.

Python tests:
```sh
# Make sure to install test dependencies first
pip install -r python/tests/requirements.txt
# Run unit tests. consider -s for more verbose output
pytest python/tests/ -v -m &quot;not oss_skip&quot;
```

Garage is an S3-compatible distributed object storage service
designed for self-hosting at a small-to-medium scale.

Garage is designed for storage clusters composed of nodes running
at different physical locations,
in order to easily provide a storage service that replicates data at these different
locations and stays available even when some servers are unreachable.
Garage also focuses on being lightweight, easy to operate, and highly resilient to
machine failures.

Garage is built by [Deuxfleurs](https://deuxfleurs.fr),
an experimental small-scale self hosted service provider,
which has been using it in production since its first release in 2020.

In other words, Stalwart already does everything you‚Äôd expect from a modern, standards-compliant mail and collaboration platform.

The next major milestone is all about refinement: finalizing the database schema and focusing on performance optimizations to ensure everything runs as efficiently and reliably as possible. Once that‚Äôs done, we‚Äôll be ready to roll out version **1.0**.

Of course, development doesn‚Äôt stop there. The community has contributed hundreds of great ideas for improvements and new features, everything from subtle usability tweaks to entirely new integrations. You can see the full list of proposals over on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Aenhancement). If there‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like to see prioritized, just give it a thumbs up as we plan to implement enhancements based on the community‚Äôs votes.

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

Tauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:

| Platform   | Versions                                                                                                        |

# Patina

[![release]][_release]

This repository hosts the Patina project - a Rust implementation of UEFI firmware.

The goal of this project is to serve as a replacement for core UEFI firmware components so they are written in Pure
Rust as opposed to Rust wrappers around core implementation still written in C.

## Background

There have been various [instances of advocacy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2019/11/using-rust-in-windows)
for building system level software in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This repository contains a Rust [UEFI](https://uefi.org/) firmware implementation called Patina. We plan to enable an
incremental migration of today&#039;s firmware components largely written in C to Rust starting with the core. The primary
objective for this effort is to improve the security and stability of system firmware by leveraging the memory safety
offered by Rust while retaining similar boot performance.

## Important Notes

This repository is still considered to be in a &quot;beta&quot; stage at this time. Platform testing and integration feedback
is very welcome.

Before making pull requests at a minimum, run:

```shell
cargo make all
```

## Performing a Release

Below is the information required to perform a release that publishes to the registry feed:

1. Review the current draft release on the github repo: [Releases](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/releases)
   1. If something is incorrect, update it in the draft release
   2. If you need to manually change the version, make sure you update the associated git tag value in the draft release
2. Publish the release
3. Monitor the publish release workflow that is automatically triggered on the release being published:
   [Publish Release Workflow](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/actions/workflows/publish-release.yml)
4. Once completed successfully, click on the  &quot;Notify Branch Creation Step&quot; and click the provided link to create the
   PR to update all versions in all Cargo.toml files across the repository.

## Documentation

We have &quot;Getting Started&quot; documentation located in this repository at `docs/*`. The latest documentation can be found
at &lt;https://OpenDevicePartnership.github.io/patina/&gt;, however this documentation can also be self-hosted via
([mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)). Once you all dependencies installed as specified below, you can run
`mdbook serve docs` to self host the getting started book.

You can also generate API documentation for the project using `cargo make doc`. This will eventually be hosted on
docs.rs once we begin uploading to crates.io. You can have the documentation opened in your browser by running
`cargo make doc-open`.

## First-Time Tool Setup Instructions

1. Follow the steps outlined by [Getting Started - Rust Programming Language (rust-lang.org)](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
to install, update (if needed), and test cargo/rust.

2. The `[toolchain]` section of the [rust-toolchain.toml](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/blob/HEAD/rust-toolchain.toml)
file contains the tools necessary to compile and can be installed through rustup.

   ```shell
   rustup toolchain install
   ```

3. The `[tools]` section of the [rust-toolchain.toml](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina/blob/HEAD/rust-toolchain.toml)
file contains tools to support commands such as `cargo make coverage` and must be installed manually.  A local build
does not need them all, but at a minimum, cargo-make and cargo-llvm-cov should be installed.

   ```shell
   cargo install cargo-make
   cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
   ```

4. Another optional tool that has proven useful for speeding up the build process is &#039;cargo-binstall&#039;, located on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall).  See the readme.md file in that repository for installation and
usage instructions.

## Build

All of the Patina crates can be compiled in one of 3 supported targets; aarch64, x64, or native.

```shell
cargo make build-aarch64
   - or -
cargo make build-x64
   - or -
cargo make build
```

By default, the make compiles a developer build, but development or release can be indicated by using the &quot;-p&quot; flag

```shell
cargo make -p development build-aarch64
   - or -
cargo make -p release build-aarch64
```

## Test

- Run all unit tests in the workspace:

```shell
cargo make test
```

- Run tests in an individual package:

```shell
cargo make test -p patina
```

Build on-platform tests in the workspace:

```shell
cargo make patina-test
```

- Build on-platform tests in an individual package:

```shell
cargo make patina-test -p patina
```

## Rust Version Updates

Rust is released on a regular six week cadence. The Rust project maintains a site with
[dates for upcoming releases](https://forge.rust-lang.org/). While there is no hard requirement to update the Rust
version used by Patina in a given timeframe, it is recommended to do so at least once per quarter. Updates to the
latest stable version should not happen immediately after the stable version release as Patina consumers may need time
to update their internal toolchains to migrate to the latest stable version.

A pull request that updates the Rust version should always be created against the `main` branch. The pull request should
include the `OpenDevicePartnership/patina-contributors` team as reviewers and remain open for at least three full
business days to ensure that stakeholders have an opportunity to review and provide feedback.

### Updating the Minimum Supported Rust Version

The Rust toolchain used in this repo is specified in `rust-toolchain.toml`. The minimum supported Rust version for the
crates in the workspace is specified in the `rust-version` field of each crate&#039;s `Cargo.toml` file. When updating the
Rust toolchain version, the minimum supported Rust version should be evaluated to determine if it also needs to be
updated.

A non-exhaustive list of reasons the minimum version might need to change includes:

1. An unstable feature has been stabilized and the corresponding `#![feature(...)]` has been removed
2. A feature introduced in the release is immediately being used in the repository

&gt; Note: If the minimum supported Rust version does need to change, please add a comment explaining wny. Note that
&gt; formatting and linting changes to satisfy tools like rustfmt or clippy do not alone necessitate a minimum Rust
&gt; version change.

A quick way to check if the minimum supported Rust version needs to change is to keep the changes made for the new
release in your workspace and then revert the Rust toolchain to the previous version. If the project fails to build,
then the minimum supported Rust version needs to be updated.

## Coverage

The coverage command will generate test coverage data for all crates in the project.  To target a single crate, the
name can be added to the command line.

```shell
cargo make coverage
   - or -
cargo make coverage dxe_core
```

## Benchmarks

Various crates have benchmarks setup that can be executed using the `cargo make bench` command. Any arguments provided
will be passed along to the bench command:

```cmd
cargo make bench -p patina
cargo make bench -p patina --bench bench_component
cargo make bench -p patina --bench bench_component -- with_component
```

Benchmarks utilize the [criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion) benchmarking library, so if new benchmarks are
to be added, they should follow that documentation. Benchmarks can be added to any crate to test performance by
following the same layout as existing benchmarks, and adding the benchmark to the appropriate crate&#039;s Cargo.toml file.

## Notes

- This project uses a makefile that sets the &quot;RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1&quot; environment variable due to internal requirements which
puts us in parity with the nightly features that exist on the toolchain targeted.  The &quot;nightly&quot; toolchain may be used
in place of this.

## High-Level Patina Roadmap

Patina&#039;s upcoming work falls into three main categories:

1. **Stabilization** - Bug fixes, performance improvements, and feature completion for existing functionality. This
   work is focused on ensuring that everything in Patina&#039;s main branch is stable and ready for production use. This is
   the primary focus for the next several months.
2. **Expansion** - Expansion of Patina&#039;s capabilities and this falls into two sub-categories:
   1. **Component Growth** - Adding new components to Patina to replace equivalent C-based UEFI components. As new
      components are made available, it is expected that platforms adopting Patina will incrementally remove their
      C-based UEFI components as the equivalent Rust-based functionality is now available in their Patina build.
   2. **MM Core Support** - Similar to the DXE Core support in Patina today, adding a Patina Standalone MM Core such
      that the Management Mode (MM) core environment is written in Rust and a larger portion of MM drivers can be
      ported to Patina MM components.
3. **Ecosystem Integration** - This is broken down into two sub-categories:
    1. **Firmware Ecosystem** - Patina adopters working together to ensure Patina works in their platforms and use
        cases. This includes things like platform bring-up, integration with existing firmware components, and
        validation against various hardware configurations.
    2. **Rust Ecosystem** - Engaging with the broader Rust community to ensure Patina aligns with Rust&#039;s best
        practices and leverages the latest Rust features. This includes things like contributing to Rust libraries,
        participating in Rust forums, and collaborating with other Rust projects.

### Status

1. **Stabilization** - In Progress
2. **Expansion**
    1. **Component Growth** - In Progress
    2. **MM Core Support** - Planned
3. **Ecosystem Integration**
    1. **Firmware Ecosystem** - In Progress
    2. **Rust Ecosystem** - In Progress

Patina welcomes and encourages community contributions to help accelerate progress in these focus areas. We also value
your ideas and feedback on additional priorities that matter to the community.

## Shell Completions

`ut` supports shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, nushell, elvish, and PowerShell. To enable tab completion:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zsh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# Generate and save completions to your fpath
ut completions zsh &gt; ~/.zsh/completions/_ut

# Or add directly to .zshrc (requires reload for each ut update)
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(ut completions zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bash&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
ut completions bash &gt; ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/ut
# Or add to .bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(ut completions bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
ut completions fish &gt; ~/.config/fish/completions/ut.fish
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nushell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
ut completions nushell &gt; ~/.config/nushell/completions/ut.nu
# Or use the short alias
ut completions nu &gt; ~/.config/nushell/completions/ut.nu
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;PowerShell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```powershell
ut completions powershell | Out-File -FilePath $PROFILE -Append
```

&lt;/details&gt;

After setting up completions, restart your shell or source your configuration file.

### Encoding

#### `base64`
Encode and decode data using Base64 encoding.
- Supports both standard and URL-safe character sets
- Can read from files or stdin

```bash
ut base64 encode &quot;hello world&quot;
ut base64 decode &quot;aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=&quot;
ut base64 encode --urlsafe &quot;hello world&quot;
echo -n &quot;hello world&quot; | ut base64 encode -
```

#### `url`
URL encode and decode text.

```bash
ut url encode &quot;hello world&quot;
ut url decode &quot;hello%20world&quot;
printf &quot;hello world&quot; | ut url encode -
```

### Hashing &amp; Security

#### `hash`
Generate cryptographic hash digests using various algorithms.
- Supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512
- Can read from files or stdin

```bash
ut hash sha256 &quot;hello world&quot;
ut hash md5 - &lt; file.txt
echo -n &quot;password&quot; | ut hash sha256 -
```

#### `bcrypt`
Hash and verify passwords using the bcrypt algorithm.
- Secure password hashing with configurable cost factor
- Built-in salt generation for each hash
- Verification returns &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;invalid&quot;
- Cost factor range: 4-31 (default: 12, higher = more secure but slower)

```bash
# Hash a password with default cost (12)
ut bcrypt hash &quot;mypassword&quot;
echo -n &quot;mypassword&quot; | ut bcrypt hash -

# Wrong password verification
ut bcrypt verify &quot;wrongpassword&quot; &#039;$2b$12$...&#039;
# Output: invalid
```

### Data Generation

#### `uuid`
Generate UUIDs in various versions.
- v1: Timestamp-based
- v3: Namespace + MD5 hash
- v4: Random
- v5: Namespace + SHA-1 hash
- v7: Timestamp-based, sortable

```bash
ut uuid v4
ut uuid v4 --count 5
ut uuid v5 --namespace DNS --name example.com

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use‚Äîwhether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models‚Äîlike [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]‚Äîwith a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes‚Äîwhich is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any
questions, or want to talk about future plans, please join us on Discord

start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [colocated local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#colocated-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily restore to
an earlier repo state, simply undo your operations one-by-one or even _revert_ a
particular operation which does not have to be the most recent one.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the above snippet into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abenz1267/walker.git
cd walker

# Build with Cargo
cargo build --release

# Run Walker
./target/release/walker
```

### Dependencies

- GTK4 (version 4.6+)
- gtk4-layer-shell
- Protocol Buffers compiler
- cairo
- poppler-glib
- make sure [elephant](https://github.com/abenz1267/elephant) is running before starting Walker

&lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt; &lt;h3&gt; Install using Nix &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;/summary&gt;

#### 1. Add flake inputs

Add walker and elephant to the inputs of your configs `flake.nix` and set walker to follow elephant

```nix
elephant.url = &quot;github:abenz1267/elephant&quot;;

walker = {
  url = &quot;github:abenz1267/walker&quot;;
  inputs.elephant.follows = &quot;elephant&quot;;
};
```

#### 2. Install walker

You have 3 options for installing walker.

**Option A** (Home Manager Module): Import the home-manager module to your home-manager config and enable walker.

```nix
imports = [inputs.walker.homeManagerModules.default];

programs.walker.enable = true;
```

**Option B** (NixOS Module): Import the nixos module in your NixOS config and enable walker

```nix
imports = [inputs.walker.nixosModules.default];

programs.walker.enable = true;
```

&gt; Note: this option doesn&#039;t support the `runAsService` option; It is recommended that you launch the elephant and walker services using your desktop instead.

**Option C** (Package): Add `inputs.walker.packages.&lt;system&gt;.default` to your system packages or home-manager packages. replace `&lt;system&gt;` with your system architecture. Note: This option doesn&#039;t support configuration using nix.

```nix
home.packages = [inputs.walker.packages.&lt;system&gt;.default];
```

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [inputs.walker.packages.&lt;system&gt;.default];
```

#### 3. Configure walker

```nix
programs.walker = {
  enable = true;
  runAsService = true; # Note: this option isn&#039;t supported in the NixOS module only in the home-manager module

  # All options from the config.toml can be used here https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/blob/master/resources/config.toml
  config = {
    theme = &quot;your theme name&quot;;
    placeholders.&quot;default&quot; = { input = &quot;Search&quot;; list = &quot;Example&quot;; };
    providers.prefixes = [
      {provider = &quot;websearch&quot;; prefix = &quot;+&quot;;}
      {provider = &quot;providerlist&quot;; prefix = &quot;_&quot;;}
    ];
    keybinds.quick_activate = [&quot;F1&quot; &quot;F2&quot; &quot;F3&quot;];
  };
  
  # Set `programs.walker.config.theme=&quot;your theme name&quot;` to choose the default theme
  themes = {
    &quot;your theme name&quot; = {
      # Check out the default css theme as an example https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/blob/master/resources/themes/default/style.css
      style = &quot; /* css */ &quot;;

      # Check out the default layouts for examples https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/tree/master/resources/themes/default
      layouts = {
        &quot;layout&quot; = &quot; &lt;!-- xml --&gt; &quot;;
        &quot;item_calc&quot; = &quot; &lt;!-- xml --&gt; &quot;;
        # other provider layouts
      };
    };
    &quot;other theme name&quot; = {
        # ...
    };
    # more themes
  };
};
```

Optionally, there is 2 binary caches which can be used by adding the following to you config:

```nix
nix.settings = {
  extra-substituters = [&quot;https://walker.cachix.org&quot; &quot;https://walker-git.cachix.org&quot;];
  extra-trusted-public-keys = [&quot;walker.cachix.org-1:fG8q+uAaMqhsMxWjwvk0IMb4mFPFLqHjuvfwQxE4oJM=&quot; &quot;walker-git.cachix.org-1:vmC0ocfPWh0S/vRAQGtChuiZBTAe4wiKDeyyXM0/7pM=&quot;];
};
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Make sure `elephant` is running and you have providers installed. `elephant-providerlist` and f.e. `elephant-desktopapplications`.**

Launch Walker with `walker`.

In order to improve startup performance, run a Walker service with:

```bash
walker --gapplication-service
```

If the service is running, you can either open Walker with:

```bash
walker
```

or for an even faster launch make a socket call, f.e. with `openbsd-netcat`:

```bash
nc -U /run/user/1000/walker/walker.sock
```

The downside of the socket call is that it does not handle any commandline options, so it&#039;s just a faster alternative to a simple `walker` call.

## Keybinds

The following modifier keys are valid: `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, `super`.

To get a full list of possible key values, look here: [GDK key-values](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/blob/0.9/gdk4/sys/src/lib.rs#L302).

F.e. `pub const GDK_KEY_semicolon: c_int = 59;` means that `ctrl semicolon` would be a valid keybind.

## Config

Configuration should be done in `~/.config/walker`.

Check out the [default config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abenz1267/walker/refs/heads/master/resources/config.toml).

## Theming

You can customize Walker&#039;s appearance by creating a custom theme. Checkout `resources/themes/default` for the default theme. Themes inherit the default theme by default, so if you just want to change the CSS, you can just create `themes/yours/style.css`.

You can customize rendering of list items for each provider individually, f.e. &quot;item_files.xml&quot; will define the layout for items sourced from the `files` provider.

Please refer to [the GTK4 docs](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/) to checkout how to write `*.xml` files for GTK4.

You can set the default theme in your `config.toml` f.e. `theme = &quot;yours&quot;`.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

---

**Burn is a next generation Tensor Library and Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on
&lt;br /&gt; flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Burn is both a tensor library and a deep learning framework optimized for numerical computing, model
inference and model training. Burn leverages Rust to perform optimizations normally only available
in static-graph frameworks, offering optimal speed without impacting flexibility.

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust
implementations. We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your
models in the cloud, then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.

&lt;/div&gt;

### Supported Backends

| no-std | -            | ‚òëÔ∏è      | -      | -        |

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend üîÑ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let device = Default::default();

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &amp;device).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
All first-party accelerated backends (like WGPU and CUDA) use Fusion by default (`burn/fusion`
feature flag), so you typically don&#039;t need to apply it manually.

```rust
#[cfg(not(feature = &quot;fusion&quot;))]
pub type Cuda&lt;F = f32, I = i32&gt; = CubeBackend&lt;CudaRuntime, F, I, u8&gt;;

#[cfg(feature = &quot;fusion&quot;)]
pub type Cuda&lt;F = f32, I = i32&gt; = burn_fusion::Fusion&lt;CubeBackend&lt;CudaRuntime, F, I, u8&gt;&gt;;
```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on
the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server. The client sends tensor operations over the
network to a remote compute backend. You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line
of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand üëá**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard üìà
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption üõ°

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support üê´
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn supports importing ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models, allowing you to easily port
models from TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn. The ONNX model is converted into Rust code that uses
Burn&#039;s native APIs, enabling the imported model to run on any Burn backend (CPU, GPU, WebAssembly)
and benefit from all of Burn&#039;s optimizations like automatic kernel fusion.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch or Safetensors Models üöö
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You can load weights from PyTorch or Safetensors formats directly into your Burn-defined models.
This makes it easy to reuse existing models while benefiting from Burn&#039;s performance and deployment
features.

Learn more:

- [Import pre-trained PyTorch models into Burn](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/pytorch-model.html)
- [Load models from Safetensors format](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/safetensors-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser üåê
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can run in WebAssembly environments: Candle and NdArray for CPU execution,
and WGPU for GPU acceleration via WebGPU. This means that you can run inference directly within a
browser. We provide several examples of this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2Ô∏è‚É£ 7Ô∏è‚É£ üò∞
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! üåÑ

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ‚öôÔ∏è
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related
&gt; to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency
&gt; chain. To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs`
&gt; file:
&gt;
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due
&gt; to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.

## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book üî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/books/burn/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests üòÑ

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples üôè
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

We have a somewhat large amount of [examples](./examples) in the repository that shows how to use
the framework in different scenarios.

computer!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Pre-trained Models ü§ñ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

We keep an updated and curated list of models and examples built with Burn, see the
[tracel-ai/models repository](https://github.com/tracel-ai/models) for more details.

Don&#039;t see the model you want? Don&#039;t hesitate to open an issue, and we may prioritize it. Built a
model using Burn and want to share it? You can also open a Pull Request and add your model under the
community section!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Why use Rust for Deep Learning? ü¶Ä
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Deep Learning is a special form of software where you need very high level abstractions as well as
extremely fast execution time. Rust is the perfect candidate for that use case since it provides
zero-cost abstractions to easily create neural network modules, and fine-grained control over memory
to optimize every detail.

It&#039;s important that a framework be easy to use at a high level so that its users can focus on
innovating in the AI field. However, since running models relies so heavily on computations,
performance can&#039;t be neglected.

To this day, the mainstream solution to this problem has been to offer APIs in Python, but rely on
bindings to low-level languages such as C/C++. This reduces portability, increases complexity and
creates frictions between researchers and engineers. We feel like Rust&#039;s approach to abstractions
makes it versatile enough to tackle this two languages dichotomy.

Rust also comes with the Cargo package manager, which makes it incredibly easy to build, test, and
deploy from any environment, which is usually a pain in Python.

Although Rust has the reputation of being a difficult language at first, we strongly believe it
leads to more reliable, bug-free solutions built faster (after some practice üòÖ)!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&gt; **Deprecation Note**&lt;br /&gt;Since `0.14.0`, the internal structure for tensor data has changed. The
&gt; previous `Data` struct was deprecated and officially removed since `0.17.0` in favor of the new
&gt; `TensorData` struct, which allows for more flexibility by storing the underlying data as bytes and
&gt; keeping the data type as a field. If you are using `Data` in your code, make sure to switch to
&gt; `TensorData`.

&lt;!-- &gt;
&gt; In the event that you are trying to load a model record saved in a previous version, make sure to
&gt; enable the `record-backward-compat` feature using a previous version of burn (&lt;=0.16.0). Otherwise,
&gt; the record won&#039;t be deserialized correctly and you will get an error message (which will also point
&gt; you to the backward compatible feature flag). The backward compatibility was maintained for
&gt; deserialization (loading), so as soon as you have saved the record again it will be saved according
&gt; to the new structure and you will be able to upgrade to this version. Please note that binary formats
&gt; are not backward compatible. Thus, you will need to load your record in a previous version and save it
&gt; to another of the self-describing record formats before using a compatible version (as described) with the
&gt; `record-backward-compat` feature flag. --&gt;

&lt;details id=&quot;deprecation&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Loading Model Records From Previous Versions ‚ö†Ô∏è
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In the event that you are trying to load a model record saved in a version older than `0.14.0`, make
sure to use a compatible version (`0.14`, `0.15` or `0.16`) with the `record-backward-compat`
feature flag.

```
features = [..., &quot;record-backward-compat&quot;]
```

Otherwise, the record won&#039;t be deserialized correctly and you will get an error message. This e

[![BAML Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/baml-py?color=006dad&amp;label=BAML%20Version)](https://pypi.org/project/baml-py/)

## BAML: Basically a Made-up Language
&lt;h4&gt;

[Homepage](https://www.boundaryml.com/) | [Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com) | [BAML AI Chat](https://www.boundaryml.com/chat) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/BTNBeXGuaS)



&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

BAML is a simple prompting language for building reliable **AI workflows and agents**.

BAML makes prompt engineering easy by turning it into _schema engineering_ -- where you mostly focus on the models of your prompt -- to get more reliable outputs. 
You don&#039;t need to write your whole app in BAML, only the prompts! You can wire-up your LLM Functions in any language of your choice! See our quickstarts for [Python](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/python), [TypeScript](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/typescript), [Ruby](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/ruby) and [Go, and more](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/rest-api-other-languages).

BAML comes with all batteries included -- with full typesafety, streaming, retries, wide model support, even when they don&#039;t support native [tool-calling APIs](#enable-reliable-tool-calling-with-any-model)

**Try BAML**: [Prompt Fiddle](https://www.promptfiddle.com) ‚Ä¢ [Interactive App Examples](https://baml-examples.vercel.app/)


## The core BAML principle: LLM Prompts are functions

The fundamental building block in BAML is a function. Every prompt is a function that takes in parameters and returns a type.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; string
```

Every function additionally defines which models it uses and what its prompt is.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; StopTool | ReplyTool {
    client &quot;openai/gpt-4o-mini&quot;

    prompt #&quot;
        Be a {{ tone }} bot.

        {{ ctx.output_format }}

        {% for m in message %}
        {{ _.role(m.role) }}
        {{ m.content }}
        {% endfor %}
    &quot;#
}

class Message {
    role string
    content string
}

class ReplyTool {
  response string
}

class StopTool {
  action &quot;stop&quot; @description(#&quot;
    when it might be a good time to end the conversation
  &quot;#)
}
```

## BAML Functions can be called from any language
Below we call the ChatAgent function we defined in BAML through Python. BAML&#039;s Rust compiler generates a &quot;baml_client&quot; to access and call them.

```python
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import Message, StopTool

messages = [Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=&quot;How can I help?&quot;)]

while True:
  print(messages[-1].content)
  user_reply = input()
  messages.append(Message(role=&quot;user&quot;, content=user_reply))
  tool = b.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
  if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
    print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
    break
  else:
    messages.append(Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=tool.response))
```
You can write any kind of agent or workflow using chained BAML functions. An agent is a while loop that calls a Chat BAML Function with some state.

And if you need to stream, add a couple more lines:
```python
stream = b.stream.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
# partial is a Partial type with all Optional fields
for tool in stream:
    if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
      ...
    
final = stream.get_final_response()
```
And get fully type-safe outputs for each chunk in the stream.

## Test prompts 10x faster, right in your IDE
BAML comes with native tooling for VSCode (jetbrains + neovim coming soon). 

**Visualize full prompt (including any multi-modal assets), and the API request**. BAML gives you full transparency and control of the prompt.

![raw-curl](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b34db9-80cd-45a7-a356-6b5ab4a9c5b7)

**Using AI is all about iteration speed.**

If testing your pipeline takes 2 minutes, you can only test 10 ideas in 20 minutes.

If you reduce it to 5 seconds, you can test 240 ideas in the same amount of time.
![resume-attempt2-smaller2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc6b8a6-ffed-4cfc-80b8-78bc8a3d66a6)

The playground also allows you to run tests in parallel -- for even faster iteration speeds üöÄ.

No need to login to websites, and no need to manually define json schemas.

## Enable reliable tool-calling with any model
BAML works even when the models don&#039;t support native tool-calling APIs. We created the SAP (schema-aligned parsing) algorithm to support the flexible outputs LLMs can provide, like markdown within a JSON blob or chain-of-thought prior to answering. [Read more about SAP](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsing)

With BAML, your structured outputs work in Day-1 of a model release. No need to figure out whether a model supports parallel tool calls, or whether it supports recursive schemas, or `anyOf` or `oneOf` etc.

See it in action with: **[Deepseek-R1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/deepseek-r1-function-calling)** and [OpenAI O1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/openai-o1).

## Build beautiful streaming UIs
BAML generates a ton of utilities for NextJS, Python (and any language) to make streaming UIs easy.
![recipe-generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf82495b-21fc-40bf-ae98-93eef923d620)

BAML&#039;s streaming interfaces are fully type-safe. Check out the [Streaming Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/baml-basics/streaming), and our [React hooks](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/framework-integration/react-next-js/quick-start)

## Fully Open-Source, and offline
- 100% open-source (Apache 2)
- 100% private. AGI will not require an internet connection, neither will BAML
    - No network requests beyond model calls you explicitly set
    - Not stored or used for any training data
- BAML files can be saved locally on your machine and checked into Github for easy diffs.
- Built in Rust. So fast, you can&#039;t even tell it&#039;s there.

## BAML&#039;s Design Philosophy

Everything is fair game when making new syntax. If you can code it, it can be yours. This is our design philosophy to help restrict ideas:

- **1:** Avoid invention when possible
    - Yes, prompts need versioning ‚Äî we have a great versioning tool: git
    - Yes, you need to save prompts ‚Äî we have a great storage tool: filesystems
- **2:** Any file editor and any terminal should be enough to use it
- **3:** Be fast
- **4:** A first year university student should be able to understand it

## Why a new programming language

We used to write websites like this:

```python
def home():
    return &quot;&lt;button onclick=\&quot;() =&gt; alert(\\\&quot;hello!\\\&quot;)\&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;&quot;
```

And now we do this:

```jsx
function Home() {
  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prev =&gt; prev + 1)}&gt;
          {count} clicks!
         &lt;/button&gt;
}
```

New syntax can be incredible at expressing new ideas. Plus the idea of maintaining hundreds of f-strings for prompts kind of disgusts us ü§Æ. Strings are bad for maintainable codebases. We prefer structured strings.

The goal of BAML is to give you the expressiveness of English, but the structure of code.

Full [blog post](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/ai-agents-need-new-syntax) by us.


## Conclusion

As models get better, we&#039;ll continue expecting even more out of them. But what will never change is that we&#039;ll want a way to write maintainable code that uses those models. The current way we all just assemble strings is very reminiscent of the early days PHP/HTML soup in web development. We hope some of the ideas we shared today can make a tiny dent in helping us all shape the way we all code tomorrow.

[English] | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá]


Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

## Introduction

Meetily is a privacy-first AI meeting assistant that runs entirely on your local machine. It captures your meetings, transcribes them in real-time, and generates summaries, all without sending any data to the cloud. This makes it the perfect solution for professionals and enterprises who need to maintain complete control over their sensitive information.

## Why Meetily?

While there are many meeting transcription tools available, this solution stands out by offering:

- **Privacy First:** All processing happens locally on your device.
- **Cost-Effective:** Uses open-source AI models instead of expensive APIs.
- **Flexible:** Works offline and supports multiple meeting platforms.
- **Customizable:** Self-host and modify for your specific needs.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;The Privacy Problem&lt;/summary&gt;

Meeting AI tools create significant privacy and compliance risks across all sectors:

- **$4.4M average cost per data breach** (IBM 2024)
- **‚Ç¨5.88 billion in GDPR fines** issued by 2025
- **400+ unlawful recording cases** filed in California this year

Whether you&#039;re a defense consultant, enterprise executive, legal professional, or healthcare provider, your sensitive discussions shouldn&#039;t live on servers you don&#039;t control. Cloud meeting tools promise convenience but deliver privacy nightmares with unclear data storage practices and potential unauthorized access.

**Meetily solves this:** Complete data sovereignty on your infrastructure, zero vendor lock-in, and full control over your sensitive conversations.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Features

- **Local First:** All processing is done on your machine. No data ever leaves your computer.
- **Real-time Transcription:** Get a live transcript of your meeting as it happens.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Generate summaries of your meetings using powerful language models.
- **Multi-Platform:** Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Open Source:** Meetily is open source and free to use.

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ÀàdiÀêno ä/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

__Cube Core is an open-source semantic layer and LookML alternative.__ It can be used by data professionals to access data from modern data stores, organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it to every application. Cube Core is headless and comes with multiple APIs for embedded analytics and BI: REST, GraphQL and SQL. If you are looking for a fully integrated platform, similar to Looker, check out our commercial product - [Cube](https://cube.dev).

Cube was designed to work with all SQL-enabled data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, query engines like Presto or Amazon Athena, and application databases like Postgres. Cube has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

For more details, see the [introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction?ref=github-readme) page in our documentation.

## Why Cube?

As data infrastructure evolved from traditional relational databases to cloud data platforms, OLAP capabilities that once lived in specialized servers like SQL Server Analysis Services and Oracle Essbase were left behind. Today&#039;s organizations face several challenges:

1. __Analytics Modeling and Multidimensionality.__ Modern cloud data platforms excel at processing large volumes of data but lack native support for multidimensional analysis and modeling. Cube brings OLAP-style analytics to these platforms, enabling consistent metric definitions and multidimensional analysis.

2. __Performance Optimization.__ While cloud data warehouses have improved query performance through column-oriented storage and distributed processing, they still struggle with complex analytical workloads. Cube provides intelligent caching and pre-aggregation strategies that dramatically improve query response times.

3. __Access Control and Governance.__ Securing and governing access to data across all consuming applications remains critical. Cube offers robust access control to ensure consistent security across your entire data ecosystem.

4. __API Flexibility.__ Legacy OLAP tools were limited in how they exposed data. Cube provides modern REST, GraphQL, and SQL APIs along with support for traditional MDX and DAX interfaces, making it a truly universal semantic layer.

Cube is the missing OLAP engine for the cloud data platform era that provides the necessary infrastructure and features to implement efficient data modeling, access control, and performance optimizations without duplicating analytics modeling, data, or security permissions across different tools.

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## Latest News

- [08/05] Deploy `openai/gpt-oss-120b` with disaggregated serving on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs using Dynamo [‚û°Ô∏è link](./docs/backends/trtllm/gpt-oss.md)

## The Era of Multi-GPU, Multi-Node

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models are quickly outgrowing the memory and compute budget of any single GPU. Tensor-parallelism solves the capacity problem by spreading each layer across many GPUs‚Äîand sometimes many servers‚Äîbut it creates a new one: how do you coordinate those shards, route requests, and share KV cache fast enough to feel like one accelerator? This orchestration gap is exactly what NVIDIA Dynamo is built to close.

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:

- **Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference** ‚Äì Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.
- **Dynamic GPU scheduling** ‚Äì Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-aware request routing** ‚Äì Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated data transfer** ‚Äì Reduces inference response time using NIXL.
- **KV cache offloading** ‚Äì Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.

# Installation

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/reference/support-matrix.md](docs/reference/support-matrix.md)

## 1. Initial setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install Python development headers

Backend engines require Python development headers for JIT compilation. Install them with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

### Install etcd and NATS (required)

To coordinate across a data center, Dynamo relies on etcd and NATS. To run Dynamo locally, these need to be available.

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs jetstream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup etcd &amp; NATS, you can also run:

```
# At the root of the repository:
# Edit deploy/docker-compose.yml to comment out &quot;runtime: nvidia&quot; of the dcgm-exporter service if the nvidia container runtime isn&#039;t deployed or to be used.
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 2. Select an engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, and trtllm. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Sanity check (optional)

Before trying out Dynamo, you can verify your system configuration and dependencies:

```bash
./deploy/sanity_check.py
```

This is a quick check for system resources, development tools, LLM frameworks, and Dynamo components.

### Running an LLM API server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** ‚Äì High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** ‚Äì Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** ‚Äì Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server, a pre-processor (prompt templating and tokenization) and a router.
# Pass the TLS certificate and key paths to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
python -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 [--tls-cert-path cert.pem] [--tls-key-path key.pem]

# Start the SGLang engine, connecting to NATS and etcd to receive requests. You can run several of these,
# both for the same model and for multiple models. The frontend node will discover them.
python -m dynamo.sglang --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
```

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### Deploying Dynamo

- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](docs/kubernetes/README.md) to deploy on Kubernetes.
- Check out [Backends](components/backends) to deploy various workflow configurations (e.g. SGLang with router, vLLM with disaggregated serving, etc.)
- Run some [Examples](examples) to learn about building components in Dynamo and exploring various integrations.

### Benchmarking Dynamo

Dynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools to evaluate and optimize your deployments:

- **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** ‚Äì Compare deployment topologies (aggregated vs. disaggregated vs. vanilla vLLM) using AIPerf
- **[Pre-Deployment Profiling](docs/benchmarks/pre_deployment_profiling.md)** ‚Äì Optimize configurations before deployment to meet SLA requirements

# Engines

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic. To use any engine with Dynamo, NATS and etcd need to be installed, along with a Dynamo frontend (`python -m dynamo.frontend [--interactive]`).

## vLLM

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

vLLM attempts to allocate enough KV cache for the full context length at startup. If that does not fit in your available memory pass `--context-length &lt;value&gt;`.

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

## SGLang

```
# Install libnuma
apt install -y libnuma-dev

uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.sglang --help
```

You can pass any sglang flags directly to this worker, see https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/server_arguments.html . See there to use multiple GPUs.

## TensorRT-LLM

It is recommended to use [NGC PyTorch Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for running the TensorRT-LLM engine.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Ensure that you select a PyTorch container image version that matches the version of TensorRT-LLM you are using.
&gt; For example, if you are using `tensorrt-llm==1.1.0rc5`, use the PyTorch container image version `25.06`.
&gt; To find the correct PyTorch container version for your desired `tensorrt-llm` release, visit the [TensorRT-LLM Dockerfile.multi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.multi) on GitHub. Switch to the branch that matches your `tensorrt-llm` version, and look for the `BASE_TAG` line to identify the recommended PyTorch container tag.

&gt; [!Important]
&gt; Launch container with the following additional settings `--shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1`

### Install prerequisites

```
# Optional step: Only required for Blackwell and Grace Hopper
uv pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Required until the trtllm version is bumped to include this pinned dependency itself
uv pip install &quot;cuda-python&gt;=12,&lt;13&quot;

sudo apt-get -y install libopenmpi-dev
```

&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; You can learn more about these prequisites and known issues with TensorRT-LLM pip based installation [here](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html).

### After installing the pre-requisites above, install Dynamo

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[trtllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.trtllm --help
```

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

# Developing Locally

## 1. Install libraries

**Ubuntu:**

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
```

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```

If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.

## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python virtual env:

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don&#039;t have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install build tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install the wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e .
```

You should now be able to run `python -m dynamo.frontend`.

Remember that nats and etcd must be running (see earlier).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.

could happen to your phone.

&lt;img src=&quot;/resources/screenshots/v0.5.0.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; alt=&quot;uad_screenshot&quot;&gt;

**This software is still in an early stage of development. Check out the issues, and feel free to contribute!**

## Summary

This is a complete rewrite in Rust of the [UAD project](https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater),
which aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary
and obscure system apps.
This can also contribute to improve security by reducing [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface).

Packages are as well documented as possible in order to provide a better
understanding of what you can delete or not. The worst issue that could happen
is removing an essential system package needed during boot causing then an unfortunate
bootloop. After about 5 failed system boots, the phone will automatically reboot
in recovery mode, and you&#039;ll have to perform a FACTORY RESET. Make a backup first!

In any case, you **CANNOT** brick your device with this software!
That&#039;s the main point, right?

## Features

- [x] Uninstall/Disable and Restore/Enable system packages
- [x] Multi-user support (e.g. apps in work profiles)
- [x] Export/Import your selection in `uad_exported_selection.txt`
- [x] Multi-device support: you can connect multiple phones at the same time
- [x] All your actions are logged, so you never forget what you&#039;ve done

NB : System apps cannot truly be uninstalled without root (see the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ))

## How to use it

- **Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ)!**
- **Do a proper backup of your data! You can never be too careful!**
- Enable _Developer Options_ on your smartphone.
- Turn on _USB Debugging_ from the developer panel.
- From the settings, disconnect from any OEM accounts (when you delete an OEM
  account package it could lock you on the lockscreen because the phone can&#039;t
  associate your identity anymore)
- Install ADB (see the intructions by clicking on your OS below):
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;LINUX&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install _Android platform tools_ on your PC :

  Debian Base:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools
  ```

  Arch-Linux Base:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S android-tools
  ```

  Red Hat Base:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install android-tools
  ```

  OpenSUSE Base:

  ```bash
  sudo zypper install android-tools
  ```

  &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;MAC OS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Install _Android platform tools_

    ```bash
    brew install android-platform-tools
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;WINDOWS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Download [android platform tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)
    and unzip it somewhere.
  - [Add the android platform tools to your PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)
    **OR** make sure to launch UAD from the same directory.

  - [Install USB drivers for your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#Drivers)
  - Check your device is detected:

    ```bash
     adb devices
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

- Download the latest release of UAD GUI for your Operating System [here](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/releases).
  Take the `opengl` version only if the default version (with a Vulkan backend)
  doesn&#039;t launch.

**NOTE:** Chinese phones users may need to use the AOSP list for removing some stock
apps because those Chinese manufacturers (especially Xiaomi and Huawei) have been
using the name of AOSP packages for their own (modified &amp; closed-source) apps.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You will have to run this software whenever your OEM pushes
an update to your phone as some _uninstalled_ system apps could be reinstalled.

powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows ‚Äî and experience a 10-100x speedup ‚Äî with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.
