&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the above snippet into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

packaging as Debian:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

(N.B. Various snaps for ripgrep on Ubuntu are also available, but none of them
seem to work right and generate a number of very strange bug reports that I
don&#039;t know how to fix and don&#039;t have the time to fix. Therefore, it is no
longer a recommended installation option.)

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.85.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.85.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Servo Parallel Browser Engine Project

Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) language. It is currently developed on
64-bit macOS, 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows, 64-bit OpenHarmony, and Android.

Servo welcomes contribution from everyone. Check out:

- The [Servo Book](https://book.servo.org) for documentation
- [servo.org](https://servo.org/) for news and guides

Coordination of Servo development happens:
- Here in the Github Issues
- On the [Servo Zulip](https://servo.zulipchat.com/)
- In video calls advertised in the [Servo Project](https://github.com/servo/project/issues) repo.

## Getting help

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me.  There are a couple of channels for support:

* You can use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues) to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one.
* Start or join a thread in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/discussions); if you have general
  questions or want to chat with other wezterm users, you&#039;re welcome here!
* There is a [Matrix room via Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#wezterm:matrix.org)
  for (potentially!) real time discussions.

The GitHub Discussions and Element/Gitter rooms are better suited for questions
than bug reports, but don&#039;t be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable
using and we&#039;ll work it out.

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [📖 Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

You can find additional [setup and configurations guides](https://getfoundry.sh/config/overview) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs] and in the [config crate](./crates/config/README.md):

`wgpu` is a cross-platform, safe, pure-rust graphics API. It runs natively on Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, and OpenGL; and on top of WebGL2 and WebGPU on wasm.

The API is based on the [WebGPU standard][webgpu]. It serves as the core of the WebGPU integration in Firefox, Servo, and Deno.

## Getting Started

### Play with our Examples

Go to &lt;https://wgpu.rs/examples/&gt; to play with our examples in your browser. Requires a browser supporting WebGPU for the WebGPU examples.

### Rust

Rust examples can be found at [examples](examples). You can run the examples natively with `cargo run --bin wgpu-examples &lt;example&gt;`.

If you are new to wgpu and graphics programming, we recommend starting with https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/.

To run the examples in a browser, run `cargo xtask run-wasm`.
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, and you can choose an example to run.
Naturally, in order to display any of the WebGPU based examples, you need to make sure your browser supports it.

### C/C++

To use wgpu in C/C++, you need [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native).

If you are looking for a wgpu C++ tutorial, look at the following:

- https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/

### Others

If you want to use wgpu in other languages, there are many bindings to wgpu-native from languages such as Python, D, Julia, Kotlin, and more. See [the list](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native#bindings).

## Community

We have the Matrix space [![Matrix Space](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Space&amp;message=%23Wgpu&amp;color=blue&amp;logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#Wgpu:matrix.org) with a few different rooms that form the wgpu community:

## Wiki

We have a [wiki](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki) that serves as a knowledge base.

## Extension Specifications

While the core of wgpu is based on the WebGPU standard, we also support extensions that allow for features that the standard does not have yet.
For high-level documentation on how to use these extensions, see the individual specifications:

🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 APIs are subject to change and may allow undefined behavior if used incorrectly.

- 🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 [Ray Tracing](./docs/api-specs/ray_tracing.md).
- 🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 [Mesh Shading](./docs/api-specs/mesh_shading.md).

### Shader Support

wgpu supports shaders in [WGSL](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl/), SPIR-V, and GLSL.
Both [HLSL](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) and [GLSL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang)
have compilers to target SPIR-V. All of these shader languages can be used with any backend as we handle all of the conversions. Additionally, support for these shader inputs is not going away.

While WebGPU does not support any shading language other than WGSL, we will automatically convert your
non-WGSL shaders if you&#039;re running on WebGPU.

WGSL is always supported by default, but GLSL and SPIR-V need features enabled to compile in support.

Note that the WGSL specification is still under development,
so the [draft specification][wgsl spec] does not exactly describe what `wgpu` supports.
See [below](#tracking-the-webgpu-and-wgsl-draft-specifications) for details.

To enable SPIR-V shaders, enable the `spirv` feature of wgpu.
To enable GLSL shaders, enable the `glsl` feature of wgpu.

### Angle

[Angle](http://angleproject.org) is a translation layer from GLES to other backends developed by Google.
We support running our GLES3 backend over it in order to reach platforms DX11 support, which aren&#039;t accessible otherwise.
In order to run with Angle, the &quot;angle&quot; feature has to be enabled, and Angle libraries placed in a location visible to the application.
These binaries can be downloaded from [gfbuild-angle](https://github.com/DileSoft/gfbuild-angle) artifacts, [manual compilation](https://github.com/google/angle/blob/main/doc/DevSetup.md) may be required on Macs with Apple silicon.

On Windows, you generally need to copy them into the working directory, in the same directory as the executable, or somewhere in your path.
On Linux, you can point to them using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment.

### MSRV policy

Due to complex dependants, we have two MSRV policies:

- `naga`, `wgpu-core`, `wgpu-hal`, and `wgpu-types`&#039;s MSRV is **1.82**.
- The rest of the workspace has an MSRV of **1.88**.

It is enforced on CI (in &quot;/.github/workflows/ci.yml&quot;) with the `CORE_MSRV` and `REPO_MSRV` variables.
This version can only be upgraded in breaking releases, though we release a breaking version every three months.

The `naga`, `wgpu-core`, `wgpu-hal`, and `wgpu-types` crates should never
require an MSRV ahead of Firefox&#039;s MSRV for nightly builds, as
determined by the value of `MINIMUM_RUST_VERSION` in
[`python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py`][util].

[util]: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py

## Environment Variables

All testing and example infrastructure share the same set of environment variables that determine which Backend/GPU it will run on.

- `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` with a substring of the name of the adapter you want to use (ex. `1080` will match `NVIDIA GeForce 1080ti`).
- `WGPU_BACKEND` with a comma-separated list of the backends you want to use (`vulkan`, `metal`, `dx12`, or `gl`).
- `WGPU_POWER_PREF` with the power preference to choose when a specific adapter name isn&#039;t specified (`high`, `low` or `none`)
- `WGPU_DX12_COMPILER` with the DX12 shader compiler you wish to use (`dxc`, `static-dxc`, or `fxc`). Note that `dxc` requires `dxcompiler.dll` (min v1.8.2502) to be in the working directory, and `static-dxc` requires the `static-dxc` crate feature to be enabled. Otherwise, it will fall back to `fxc`.
- `WGPU_GLES_MINOR_VERSION` with the minor OpenGL ES 3 version number to request (`0`, `1`, `2` or `automatic`).
- `WGPU_ALLOW_UNDERLYING_NONCOMPLIANT_ADAPTER` with a boolean whether non-compliant drivers are enumerated (`0` for false, `1` for true).

When running the CTS, use the variables `DENO_WEBGPU_ADAPTER_NAME`, `DENO_WEBGPU_BACKEND`, `DENO_WEBGPU_POWER_PREFERENCE`.

## Testing

We have multiple methods of testing, each of which tests different qualities about wgpu. We automatically run our tests on CI. The current state of CI testing:

| Platform/Backend | Tests              | Notes                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Windows/DX12     | :heavy_check_mark: | using WARP            |
| Windows/OpenGL   | :heavy_check_mark: | using llvmpipe        |
| MacOS/Metal      | :heavy_check_mark: | using hardware runner |
| Linux/Vulkan     | :heavy_check_mark: | using lavapipe        |
| Linux/OpenGL ES  | :heavy_check_mark: | using llvmpipe        |
| Chrome/WebGL     | :heavy_check_mark: | using swiftshader     |
| Chrome/WebGPU    | :x:                | not set up            |

### Core Test Infrastructure

We use a tool called [`cargo nextest`](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest) to run our tests.
To install it, run `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

To run the test suite:

```
cargo xtask test
```

To run the test suite on WebGL (currently incomplete):

```
cd wgpu
wasm-pack test --headless --chrome --no-default-features --features webgl --workspace
```

This will automatically run the tests using a packaged browser. Remove `--headless` to run the tests with whatever browser you wish at `http://localhost:8000`.

If you are a user and want a way to help contribute to wgpu, we always need more help writing test cases.

### WebGPU Conformance Test Suite

WebGPU includes a Conformance Test Suite to validate that implementations are
working correctly. We run cases from the CTS against wgpu using
[Deno](https://deno.com/). A [default list of enabled
tests](./cts_runner/test.lst) is automatically run on pull requests in CI.

To run the default set of CTS tests locally, run:

```
cargo xtask cts
```

You can also specify a test selector on the command line:

```
cargo xtask cts &#039;webgpu:api,operation,command_buffer,basic:*&#039;
```

Or supply your own test list in a file:

```
cargo xtask cts -f your_tests.lst
```

To find the full list of tests, go to the
[web version of the CTS](https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/standalone/?runnow=0&amp;worker=0&amp;debug=0&amp;q=webgpu:*).

The version of the CTS used by `cargo xtask cts` is specified in
[`cts_runner/revision.txt`](./cts_runner/revision.txt).

## Tracking the WebGPU and WGSL draft specifications

The `wgpu` crate is meant to be an idiomatic Rust translation of the [WebGPU API][webgpu spec].
That specification, along with its shading language, [WGSL][wgsl spec],
are both still in the &quot;Working Draft&quot; phase,
and while the general outlines are stable,
details change frequently.
Until the specification is stabilized, the `wgpu` crate and the version of WGSL it implements
will likely differ from what is specified,
as the implementation catches up.

Exactly which WGSL features `wgpu` supports depends on how you are using it:

- When running as native code, `wgpu` uses [Naga][naga]
  to translate WGSL code into the shading language of your platform&#039;s native GPU API.
  Naga is working on catching up to the WGSL specification,
  with [bugs][naga bugs] tracking various issues,
  but there is no concise summary of differences from the specification.

- When running in a web browser (by compilation to WebAssembly)
  without the `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` relies on the browser&#039;s own WebGPU implementation.
  WGSL shaders are simply passed through to the browser,
  so that determines which WGSL features you can use.

- When running in a web browser with `wgpu`&#039;s `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` uses Naga to translate WGSL programs into GLSL.
  This uses the same version of Naga as if you were running `wgpu` as native code.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Nockchain

**Nockchain is programmable sound money that scales.**

Nockchain is a ZK-Proof of Work L1 that combines sound money incentives with modern research into data availability, app-rollups, and intent-based composability.


*Nockchain is entirely experimental and many parts are unaudited. We make no representations or guarantees as to the behavior of this software.*


## Setup

Install `rustup` by following their instructions at: [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)

Ensure you have these dependencies installed if running on Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang llvm-dev libclang-dev make protobuf-compiler
```
Clone the repo and cd into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/zorp-corp/nockchain.git &amp;&amp; cd nockchain
```

Copy the example environment file and rename it to `.env`:
```
cp .env_example .env
```

Install `hoonc`, the Hoon compiler:

```
make install-hoonc
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH&quot;
```

(If you build manually with `cargo build`, be sure to use `--release` for `hoonc`.)

## Install Wallet

After you&#039;ve run the setup and build commands, install the wallet:

```
make install-nockchain-wallet
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH&quot;
```

See the nockchain-wallet [README](./crates/nockchain-wallet/README.md) for more information.


## Install Nockchain

After you&#039;ve run the setup and build commands, install Nockchain:

```
make install-nockchain
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH&quot;
```

## Setup Keys

To generate a new key pair:

```
nockchain-wallet keygen
```

This will print a new public/private key pair + chain code to the console, as well as the seed phrase for the private key.

Use `.env_example` as a template and copy the public key to the `.env` file:

```
MINING_PUBKEY=&lt;public-key&gt;
```
When the v1 protocol cut-off block-height is reached, the miner will automatically generate v1 coinbases for blocks that it mines.
You will need to supply a pkh for the coinbase ahead of time by generating a v1 key using the latest wallet. pkhs cannot be generated
from v0 keys.

Generate the v1 pkh by running `nockchain-wallet generate-mining-pkh` on the latest version of the wallet. The pkh should be listed as the `Address`.
Then, in your `.env` file, set the `MINING_PKH` variable to the address of the v1 key you generated.

```
MINING_PKH=&lt;address&gt;
```

To reiterate, before the upgrade cutoff, the miner will generate v0 coinbases spendable by the `MINING_PUBKEY`. After the cutoff, it will generate
v1 coinbases spendable by the `MINING_PKH`.

## Backup Keys

To backup your keys, run:

```
nockchain-wallet export-keys
```

This will save your keys to a file called `keys.export` in the current directory.

They can be imported later with:

```
nockchain-wallet import-keys --file keys.export
```

## Running Nodes

Make sure your current directory is nockchain.

To run a Nockchain node without mining.

```
bash ./scripts/run_nockchain_node.sh
```

To run a Nockchain node and mine to a pubkey:

```
bash ./scripts/run_nockchain_miner.sh
```

For launch, make sure you run in a fresh working directory that does not include a .data.nockchain file from testing.

## FAQ

### Can I use same pubkey if running multiple miners?

Yes, you can use the same pubkey if running multiple miners.

### How do I change the mining pubkey?

Run `nockchain-wallet keygen` to generate a new key pair.

If you are using the Makefile workflow, copy the public key to the `.env` file.

### How do I run a testnet?
To run a testnet on your machine, follow the same instructions as above, except use the fakenet
scripts provided in the `scripts` directory.

Here&#039;s how to set it up:

```bash
Make sure you have the most up-to-date version of Nockchain installed.

Inside of the nockchain directory:

# Create directories for each instance
mkdir fakenet-hub fakenet-node

# Copy .env to each directory
cp .env fakenet-hub/
cp .env fakenet-node/

# Run each instance in its own directory with .env loaded
cd fakenet-hub &amp;&amp; sh ../scripts/run_nockchain_node_fakenet.sh
cd fakenet-node &amp;&amp; sh ../scripts/run_nockchain_miner_fakenet.sh
```

The hub script is bound to a fixed multiaddr and the node script sets that multiaddr as an initial
peer so that nodes have a way of discovering eachother initially.

You can run multiple instances using `run_nockchain_miner_fakenet.sh`, just make sure that
you are running them from different directories because the checkpoint data is located in the
working directory of the script.

### What are the networking requirements?

Nockchain requires:

1. Internet.
2. If you are behind a firewall, you need to specify the p2p ports to use and open them..
   - Example: `nockchain --bind /ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/$PEER_PORT/quic-v1`
3. **NAT Configuration (if you are behind one)**:
   - If behind NAT, configure port forwarding for the peer port
   - Use `--bind` to specify your public IP/domain
   - Example: `nockchain --bind /ip4/1.2.3.4/udp/$PEER_PORT/quic-v1`

### Why aren&#039;t Zorp peers connecting?

Common reasons for peer connection failures:

1. **Network Issues**:
   - Firewall blocking P2P port
   - NAT not properly configured
   - Incorrect bind address

2. **Configuration Issues**:
   - Invalid peer IDs

3. **Debug Steps**:
   - Check logs for connection errors
   - Verify port forwarding

### What do outgoing connection failures mean?

Outgoing connection failures can occur due to:

1. **Network Issues**:
   - Peer is offline
   - Firewall blocking connection
   - NAT traversal failure

2. **Peer Issues**:
   - Peer has reached connection limit
   - Peer is blocking your IP

3. **Debug Steps**:
   - Check peer&#039;s status
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check logs for specific error messages

### How do I know if it&#039;s mining?

You can check the logs for mining activity.

If you see a line that looks like:

```sh
[%mining-on 12.040.301.481.503.404.506 17.412.404.101.022.637.021 1.154.757.196.846.835.552 12.582.351.418.886.020.622 6.726.267.510.179.724.279]
```

### How do I check block height?

You can check the logs for a line like:

```sh
block Vo3d2Qjy1YHMoaHJBeuQMgi4Dvi3Z2GrcHNxvNYAncgzwnQYLWnGVE added to validated blocks at 2
```

That last number is the block height.

### What do common errors mean?

Common errors and their solutions:

1. **Connection Errors**:
   - `Failed to dial peer`: Network connectivity issues, you may still be connected though.
   - `Handshake with the remote timed out`: Peer might be offline, not a fatal issue.

### How do I check wallet balance?

To check your wallet balance:

```bash
# List all notes by pubkey
nockchain-wallet list-notes-by-pubkey &lt;your-pubkey&gt;
```

### How do I configure logging levels?

To reduce logging verbosity, you can set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable before running nockchain:

```bash
# Show only info and above
RUST_LOG=info nockchain

# Show only errors
RUST_LOG=error nockchain

# Show specific module logs (e.g. only p2p events)
RUST_LOG=nockchain_libp2p_io=info nockchain

# Multiple modules with different levels
RUST_LOG=nockchain_libp2p_io=info,nockchain=warn nockchain
```

Common log levels from most to least verbose:
- `trace`: Very detailed debugging information
- `debug`: Debugging information
- `info`: General operational information
- `warn`: Warning messages
- `error`: Error messages

You can also add this to your `.env` file if you&#039;re running with the Makefile:
```
RUST_LOG=info
```

### How do profile for performance?

Here&#039;s a demo video for the Tracy integration in Nockchain: https://x.com/nockchain/status/1948109668171051363

The main change since the video is tracing is now enabled by default. If you want to disable it you can [disable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#the-default-feature) the `tracing-tracy` feature here. The tracing is [inhibited](https://www.google.com/search?q=inhibit+definition&amp;sca_esv=677f3ddbc8bf65e8&amp;ei=hnSCaJuSGIGlqtsP96qM0QE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib7Z60idaOAxWBkmoFHXcVIxoQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=inhibit+definition&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmluaGliaXQgZGVmaW5pdGlvbjITEAAYgAQYkQIYsQMYigUYRhj5ATIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjItEAAYgAQYkQIYsQMYigUYRhj5ARiXBRiMBRjdBBhGGPkBGPQDGPUDGPYD2AEBSIgaUMgFWIgZcAR4AJABAJgBeaAB7AqqAQQxOS4yuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIZoAKpC8ICDhAAGIAEGLADGIYDGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYsAMYogTCAhAQABiABBiRAhiKBRhGGPkBwgIKEAAYgAQYQxiKBcICCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwHCAg4QABiABBixAxiDARiKBcICBRAuGIAEwgIREC4YgAQYsQMY0QMYgwEYxwHCAioQABiABBiRAhiKBRhGGPkBGJcFGIwFGN0EGEYY-QEY9AMY9QMY9gPYAQHCAg8QABiABBhDGIoFGEYY-QHCAikQABiABBhDGIoFGEYY-QEYlwUYjAUY3QQYRhj5ARj0Axj1Axj2A9gBAcICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAi0QABiABBiRAhixAxiKBRhGGPkBGJcFGIwFGN0EGEYY-QEY9AMY9QMY9gPYAQHCAg0QABiABBixAxhDGIoFwgIFEAAYgATCAhEQABiABBiRAhixAxiDARiKBcICChAuGIAEGLEDGArCAgcQABiABBgKwgIKEAAYgAQYsQMYCsICBxAuGIAEGArCAg0QABiABBixAxiDARgKwgIOEAAYgAQYkQIYsQMYigXCAggQABgWGAoYHpgDAIgGAZAGBboGBggBEAEYE5IHBDIzLjKgB_ePArIHBDE5LjK4B6ALwgcGMC4yNC4xyAc5&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp) by default, it only collects traces when a [Tracy profiler client](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) connects to the application. This means minimal (9% or less for the nockvm, shouldn&#039;t impact jetted mining) performance impact but the profiling data is available any time you&#039;d like to connect your Nockchain instance.

There are two main kinds of performance data Tracy will gather from your application. Instrumentation and samples. Instrumentation comes from the [tracing crate&#039;s](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) spans. The integration with [nockvm](https://github.com/zorp-corp/nockchain/tree/master/crates/nockvm) is via the same `tracing` spans. Samples are _stack samples_, so it&#039;s not a perfectly and minutely traced picture of where your time was spent. However, the default sampling rate for Tracy is _very_ high but very efficient. You should expect a problematic performance impact from connecting Tracy to an instance if every single core and hyperthread is maxed out on your machine. You should be leaving some spare threads unoccupied even on a mining instance for the Serf thread and the kernel anyway. We (Zorp Corp) generally left 4 threads unused on each mining server.

Stack samples are roughly speaking the &quot;native&quot; or Rust part of the application whereas instrumentation is the nockvm spans showing how much time you&#039;re spending in your Hoon arms plus any Rust functions that were also instrumented. You can tell them apart because the spans for Hoon will have weird paths like `blart/boop/snoot/goof/slam/woof` and no source location in the Tracy profiler UI. The Rust spans will have much plainer names mapping onto whatever the function was named, so a function like `fn slam()` will show up in the instrumentation as `slam` and have a source location path ending in a `*.rs` file.

What makes this especially powerful is:

- The profiling data is now unified into a single tool. Previously we used `samply` for Rust/native code and the JSON (nockvm) traces for the Hoon.
- Tracy can attribute what native stack samples

#### OK, but how do I get started?

Build the application like normal, it&#039;s enabled by default. No special CLI arguments, it&#039;s _enabled by default_.

Get a copy of the Tracy profiler client, it&#039;s a GUI C++ application that uses dear imgui. They may not have a release binary for your platform so you may need to build it yourself. Here&#039;s a tip: steal the build commands for Linux/macOS [from here](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/blob/6f3a023df871e180151d2e86fb656e8122e274eb/.github/workflows/linux.yml#L24-L25).

They&#039;re using Arch Linux, so make sure you have these equivalent packages installed for your platform:

```
pacman -Syu --noconfirm &amp;&amp; pacman -S --noconfirm --needed freetype2 debuginfod wayland dbus libxkbcommon libglvnd meson cmake git wayland-protocols nodejs
```

Then to build the GUI app:

```
cmake -B profiler/build -S profiler -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGIT_REV=${{ github.sha }}
cmake --build profiler/build --parallel
```

Note that your Tracy profiler GUI version and the [Tracy client library version _must_ match](https://github.com/nagisa/rust_tracy_client?tab=readme-ov-file#version-support-table) or it will not work and will refuse to connect. It&#039;ll tell you why too.

If your Nockchain instance is running locally on the same machine as your Tracy profiler client GUI it will pop up in the connect menu automatically. If you&#039;re using `ssh` to connect to a remote server (see below re: security) then you will need to add the port to `127.0.0.1` like so: `127.0.0.1:8087` and hit connect after establishing the ssh connection with the port mapping.

By default you&#039;ll only get instrumentation, not the stack samples, generally speaking. To enable stack samples you need to change some security parameters on your Linux server. Stack sampling doesn&#039;t work on macOS natively at all, if you want to profile something with stack samples on macOS, run it in Docker with a permissive seccomp profile.

Here&#039;s what you&#039;d need to do on a typical Linux server running Ubuntu LTS to enable stack samples:

```
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
```

Nerfing `perf_event_paranoid` might be enough by itself, ymmv. This commands only set these `sysctl` parameters until the server gets rebooted. Create a permanent `sysctl` config in `/etc` if you want to make it permanent. You might need to restart the process after changing the parameters as well.

#### Tracy, profiling, and security

Do _not_ expose the port the tracy server binds to from the Nockchain application instance to servers or networks you do not control end-to-end. If you have a server hosted in the cloud or a leased dedicated server, leave it private and use `ssh` to create a local proxy for the port on your dev machine.

When I demo&#039;d Tracy here&#039;s the ssh command I used:

```
ssh -L 8087:backbone-us-south-mig:8086 backbone-us-south-mig
```

`backbone-us-south-mig` is a hostname reference from my `~/.ssh/config` that we generate from a script I wrote to inject an Ansible inventory into the local SSH configuration. I&#039;m using port `8087` for the local binding because running the Tracy profiler GUI binds port 8086.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Node Won&#039;t Start**:
   - Check port availability
   - Verify .env configuration
   - Check for existing .data.nockchain file
   - Ensure proper permissions

2. **No Peers Connecting**:
   - Verify port forwarding
   - Check firewall settings

3. **Mining Not Working**:
   - Verify mining pubkey
   - Check --mine flag
   - Ensure peers are connected
   - Check system resources

4. **Wallet Issues**:
   - Verify key import/export
   - Check socket connection
   - Ensure proper permissions

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.html#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Tabs.html)

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html) page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out [awesome-niri], a list of niri-related links and projects.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: [integrated](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite) via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.

My talk from the 2024 Moscow RustCon about niri, and how I do randomized property testing and profiling, and measure input latency.
The talk is in Russian, but I prepared full English subtitles that you can find in YouTube&#039;s subtitle language selector.

[An interview with Ivan, the developer behind Niri](https://www.trommelspeicher.de/podcast/special_the_developer_behind_niri) · *June 2025*

An interview by a German tech podcast Das Triumvirat (in English).
We talk about niri development and history, and my experience building and maintaining niri.

An LWN article with a nice overview and introduction to niri.

## Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

You&#039;ve heard about Rust, but you never had the chance to try it out?\
This course is for you!

You&#039;ll learn Rust by solving 100 exercises.\
You&#039;ll go from knowing nothing about Rust to being able to start
writing your own programs, one exercise at a time.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This course has been written by [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/).\
&gt; It&#039;s one of the trainings in [our portfolio of Rust workshops](https://mainmatter.com/services/workshops/rust/).\
&gt; Check out our [landing page](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/) if you&#039;re looking for Rust consulting or
&gt; training!

## Getting started

Go to [rust-exercises.com](https://rust-exercises.com) and follow the instructions there
to get started with the course.

## Requirements

- **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).\
  If `rustup` is already installed on your system, run `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how
  you installed Rust on your system)
  to make sure you&#039;re running on the latest stable version.
- _(Optional but recommended)_ An IDE with Rust autocompletion support.
  We recommend one of the following:
  - [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/);
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with

Arnis creates complex and accurate Minecraft Java Edition worlds that reflect real-world geography, topography, and architecture.

This free and open source project is designed to handle large-scale geographic data from the real world and generate detailed Minecraft worlds. The algorithm processes geospatial data from OpenStreetMap as well as elevation data to create an accurate Minecraft representation of terrain and architecture.
Generate your hometown, big cities, and natural landscapes with ease!

## Status

This project has reached a minimum-viable-product level of quality. Many people use it as their daily driver, but it may be unstable for some commands. Nu&#039;s design is subject to change as it matures.

## Learning About Nu

The [Nushell book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/) is the primary source of Nushell documentation. You can find [a full list of Nu commands in the book](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/), and we have many examples of using Nu in our [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/).

We&#039;re also active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn); come and chat with us!

## Installation

To quickly install Nu:

```bash
# Linux and macOS
brew install nushell
# Windows
winget install nushell
```

To use `Nu` in GitHub Action, check [setup-nu](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nu) for more detail.

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [installation chapter of the book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html). Nu is available via many package managers:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nushell.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions)

For details about which platforms the Nushell team actively supports, see [our platform support policy](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

## Configuration

The default configurations can be found at [sample_config](crates/nu-utils/src/default_files)
which are the configuration files one gets when they startup Nushell for the first time.

It sets all of the default configuration to run Nushell.  From here one can
then customize this file for their specific needs.

To see where *config.nu* is located on your system simply type this command.

```rust
$nu.config-path
```

Please see our [book](https://www.nushell.sh) for all of the Nushell documentation.


## Philosophy

Nu draws inspiration from projects like PowerShell, functional programming languages, and modern CLI tools.
Rather than thinking of files and data as raw streams of text, Nu looks at each input as something with structure.
For example, when you list the contents of a directory what you get back is a table of rows, where each row represents an item in that directory.
These values can be piped through a series of steps, in a series of commands called a &#039;pipeline&#039;.

### Pipelines

In Unix, it&#039;s common to pipe between commands to split up a sophisticated command over multiple steps.
Nu takes this a step further and builds heavily on the idea of _pipelines_.
As in the Unix philosophy, Nu allows commands to output to stdout and read from stdin.
Additionally, commands can output structured data (you can think of this as a third kind of stream).
Commands that work in the pipeline fit into one of three categories:

-   Commands that produce a stream (e.g., `ls`)
-   Commands that filter a stream (e.g., `where type == &quot;dir&quot;`)
-   Commands that consume the output of the pipeline (e.g., `table`)

Commands are separated by the pipe symbol (`|`) to denote a pipeline flowing left to right.

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot; | table
# =&gt; ╭────┬──────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────╮
# =&gt; │ #  │   name   │ type │  size   │   modified    │
# =&gt; ├────┼──────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┤
# =&gt; │  0 │ .cargo   │ dir  │     0 B │ 9 minutes ago │
# =&gt; │  1 │ assets   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  2 │ crates   │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  3 │ docker   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  4 │ docs     │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  5 │ images   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  6 │ pkg_mgrs │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  7 │ samples  │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  8 │ src      │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  9 │ target   │ dir  │     0 B │ a day ago     │
# =&gt; │ 10 │ tests    │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │ 11 │ wix      │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; ╰────┴──────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────╯
```

Because most of the time you&#039;ll want to see the output of a pipeline, `table` is assumed.
We could have also written the above:

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot;
```

Being able to use the same commands and compose them differently is an important philosophy in Nu.
For example, we could use the built-in `ps` command to get a list of the running processes, using the same `where` as above.

```shell
ps | where cpu &gt; 0
# =&gt; ╭───┬───────┬───────────┬───────┬───────────┬───────────╮
# =&gt; │ # │  pid  │   name    │  cpu  │    mem    │  virtual  │
# =&gt; ├───┼───────┼───────────┼───────┼───────────┼───────────┤
# =&gt; │ 0 │  2240 │ Slack.exe │ 16.40 │ 178.3 MiB │ 232.6 MiB │
# =&gt; │ 1 │ 16948 │ Slack.exe │ 16.32 │ 205.0 MiB │ 197.9 MiB │
# =&gt; │ 2 │ 17700 │ nu.exe    │  3.77 │  26.1 MiB │   8.8 MiB │
# =&gt; ╰───┴───────┴───────────┴───────┴───────────┴───────────╯
```

### Opening files

Nu can load file and URL contents as raw text or structured data (if it recognizes the format).
For example, you can load a .toml file as structured data and explore it:

```shell
open Cargo.toml
# =&gt; ╭──────────────────┬────────────────────╮
# =&gt; │ bin              │ [table 1 row]      │
# =&gt; │ dependencies     │ {record 25 fields} │
# =&gt; │ dev-dependencies │ {record 8 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ features         │ {record 10 fields} │
# =&gt; │ package          │ {record 13 fields} │
# =&gt; │ patch            │ {record 1 field}   │
# =&gt; │ profile          │ {record 3 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ target           │ {record 3 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ workspace        │ {record 1 field}   │
# =&gt; ╰──────────────────┴────────────────────╯
```

We can pipe this into a command that gets the contents of one of the columns:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package
# =&gt; ╭───────────────┬────────────────────────────────────╮
# =&gt; │ authors       │ [list 1 item]                      │
# =&gt; │ default-run   │ nu                                 │
# =&gt; │ description   │ A new type of shell                │
# =&gt; │ documentation │ https://www.nushell.sh/book/       │
# =&gt; │ edition       │ 2018                               │
# =&gt; │ exclude       │ [list 1 item]                      │
# =&gt; │ homepage      │ https://www.nushell.sh             │
# =&gt; │ license       │ MIT                                │
# =&gt; │ metadata      │ {record 1 field}                   │
# =&gt; │ name          │ nu                                 │
# =&gt; │ repository    │ https://github.com/nushell/nushell │
# =&gt; │ rust-version  │ 1.60                               │
# =&gt; │ version       │ 0.72.0                             │
# =&gt; ╰───────────────┴────────────────────────────────────╯
```

And if needed we can drill down further:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package.version
# =&gt; 0.72.0
```

### Plugins

Nu supports plugins that offer additional functionality to the shell and follow the same structured data model that built-in commands use. There are a few examples in the `crates/nu_plugins_*` directories.

Plugins are binaries that are available in your path and follow a `nu_plugin_*` naming convention.
These binaries interact with nu via a simple JSON-RPC protocol where the command identifies itself and passes along its configuration, making it available for use.
If the plugin is a filter, data streams to it one element at a time, and it can stream data back in return via stdin/stdout.
If the plugin is a sink, it is given the full vector of final data and is given free reign over stdin/stdout to use as it pleases.

The [awesome-nu repo](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu#plugins) lists a variety of nu-plugins while the [showcase repo](https://github.com/nushell/showcase) *shows* off informative blog posts that have been written about Nushell along with videos that highlight technical
topics that have been presented.

## Goals

Nu adheres closely to a set of goals that make up its design philosophy. As features are added, they are checked against these goals.

-   First and foremost, Nu is cross-platform. Commands and techniques should work across platforms and Nu has [first-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

-   Nu ensures compatibility with existing platform-specific executables.

-   Nu&#039;s workflow and tools should have the usability expected of modern software in 2022 (and beyond).

-   Nu views data as either structured or unstructured. It is a structured shell like PowerShell.

-   Finally, Nu views data functionally. Rather than using mutation, pipelines act as a means to load, change, and save data without mutable state.

## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

## Installation

Alacritty can be installed by using various package managers on Linux, BSD,
macOS and Windows.

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Windows can also be downloaded from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

For everyone else, the detailed instructions to install Alacritty can be found
[here](INSTALL.md).

### Requirements

- At least OpenGL ES 2.0
- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)

## Configuration

You can find the documentation for Alacritty&#039;s configuration in `man 5
alacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages
installed.

[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html

Alacritty doesn&#039;t create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the
following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.toml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`
5. `/etc/alacritty/alacritty.toml`

On Windows, the config file will be looked for in:

* `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

A guideline about contributing to Alacritty can be found in the
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty&#039;s performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn&#039;t feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it&#039;s just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won&#039;t find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

![Pingora banner image](./docs/assets/pingora_banner.png)

## What is Pingora
Pingora is a Rust framework to [build fast, reliable and programmable networked systems](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source).

Pingora is battle tested as it has been serving more than 40 million Internet requests per second for [more than a few years](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet).

## Feature highlights
* Async Rust: fast and reliable
* HTTP 1/2 end to end proxy
* TLS over OpenSSL, BoringSSL, s2n-tls, or rustls(experimental).
* gRPC and websocket proxying
* Graceful reload
* Customizable load balancing and failover strategies
* Support for a variety of observability tools

## Reasons to use Pingora
* **Security** is your top priority: Pingora is a more memory safe alternative for services that are written in C/C++
* Your service is **performance-sensitive**: Pingora is fast and efficient
* Your service requires extensive **customization**: The APIs Pingora proxy framework provides are highly programmable

# Getting started

See our [quick starting guide](./docs/quick_start.md) to see how easy it is to build a load balancer.

Our [user guide](./docs/user_guide/index.md) covers more topics such as how to configure and run Pingora servers, as well as how to build custom HTTP servers and proxy logic on top of Pingora&#039;s framework.

API docs are also available for all the crates.

# Notable crates in this workspace
* Pingora: the &quot;public facing&quot; crate to build networked systems and proxies
* Pingora-core: this crate defines the protocols, functionalities and basic traits
* Pingora-proxy: the logic and APIs to build HTTP proxies
* Pingora-error: the common error type used across Pingora crates
* Pingora-http: the HTTP header definitions and APIs
* Pingora-openssl &amp; pingora-boringssl: SSL related extensions and APIs
* Pingora-ketama: the [Ketama](https://github.com/RJ/ketama) consistent algorithm
* Pingora-limits: efficient counting algorithms
* Pingora-load-balancing: load balancing algorithm extensions for pingora-proxy
* Pingora-memory-cache: Async in-memory caching with cache lock to prevent cache stampede
* Pingora-s2n: SSL extensions and APIs related to s2n-tls
* Pingora-timeout: A more efficient async timer system
* TinyUfo: The caching algorithm behind pingora-memory-cache

Note that Pingora proxy integration with caching should be considered experimental, and as such APIs related to caching are currently highly volatile.

# System requirements

## Systems
Linux is our tier 1 environment and main focus.

We will try our best for most code to compile for Unix environments. This is for developers and users to have an easier time developing with Pingora in Unix-like environments like macOS (though some features might be missing)

Windows support is preliminary by community&#039;s best effort only.

Both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures will be supported.

## Rust version

Pingora keeps a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) policy of 6 months. This means we will accept PRs that upgrade the MSRV as long as the new Rust version used is at least 6 months old.

Our current MSRV is effectively 1.82.

Previously Pingora advertised an MSRV of 1.72. Older Rust versions may still be able to compile via `cargo update` pinning dependencies such as `backtrace@0.3.74`. The advertised MSRV in config files will be officially bumped to 1.82 in an upcoming release.

Building with the optional feature `boringssl` with Boring &gt;= 4.14 requires Rust 1.80.

## Build Requirements

Some of the crates in this repository have dependencies on additional tools and
libraries that must be satisfied in order to build them:

* Make sure that [Clang] is installed on your system (for boringssl)
* Make sure that [Perl 5] is installed on your system (for openssl)

[Clang]:https://clang.llvm.org/
[Perl 5]:https://www.perl.org/

[![tests](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/flowistry.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/flowistry)
[![docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-built-blue)](https://willcrichton.net/flowistry/flowistry)

Flowistry is a tool that analyzes the [information flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_(information_theory)) of Rust programs. Flowistry understands whether it&#039;s possible for one piece of code to affect another. Flowistry integrates into the IDE to provide a &quot;focus mode&quot; which helps you focus on the code that&#039;s related to your current task.

For example, this GIF shows the focus mode when reading a function that unions two sets together:

&lt;kbd&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155062086-4d58a149-86c8-4a48-a6aa-a07cf027641c.gif&quot;  height=180 /&gt;
 &lt;/kbd&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

When the user clicks a given variable or expression, Flowistry fades out all code that *does not influence* that code, and *is not influenced by* that code. For example, `orig_len` is not influenced by the for-loop, while `set.len()` is.

Flowistry can be helpful when you&#039;re reading a function with a lot of code. For example, this GIF shows a real function in the Rust compiler. If you want to understand the role of a specific argument to the function, then Flowistry can filter out most of the code as irrelevant:

&lt;kbd&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155062527-6b42f64a-3429-4572-860f-7c2e244691d6.gif&quot; height=500 /&gt;
&lt;/kbd&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The algorithm that powers Flowistry was published in the paper [&quot;Modular Information Flow through Ownership&quot;](https://cel.cs.brown.edu/paper/modular-information-flow-ownership/) at PLDI 2022.

## Installation

### IDE plugin

Flowistry is available as a VSCode plugin. You can install Flowistry from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wcrichton.flowistry) or the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/wcrichton/flowistry). In VSCode:
* Go to the Extensions pane by clicking this button in the left margin: &lt;img width=&quot;30&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 9 30 43 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/134039225-68d11dce-be71-4f33-8057-569346ef26bc.png&quot;&gt;
* Search for &quot;Flowistry&quot; and then click &quot;Install&quot;.
* Open a Rust workspace and wait for the tool to finish installing.

**Note on platform support:** Flowistry does not yet support NixOS. Flowistry cannot provide pre-built binaries for ARM targets like M1 Macs, so Flowistry must be installed from scratch on these targets (this is done for you, but will take a few more minutes than usual).

Alternatively, you can install it from source:

```
# Install flowistry binaries
git clone https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry
cd flowistry
cargo install --path crates/flowistry_ide

# Install vscode extension
cd ide
npm install
npm run build
ln -s $(pwd) ~/.vscode/extensions/flowistry
```

### Rustc plugin

If you are interested in the underlying analysis, you can use the `flowistry` crate published to crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/flowistry

The documentation is published here: https://willcrichton.net/flowistry/flowistry/

&gt; Note: Docs.rs doesn&#039;t support documentation for crates that use `#![feature(rustc_private)]` so we have to host it ourselves.

## Usage

Note that the latest Flowistry has a [**Maximum** Supported Rust Version](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/rustc_plugin/tree/main#maximum-supported-rust-version) of **Rust 1.73**. 
Flowistry is not guaranteed to work with features implemented after 1.73.

### Startup

Once you have installed Flowistry, open a Rust workspace in VSCode. You should see this icon in the bottom toolbar:

&lt;kbd&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;121&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 46 12 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155207447-4efb34b1-5e3d-4416-89aa-a0f7cd334ca4.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/kbd&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Flowistry starts up by type-checking your codebase. This may take a few minutes if you have many dependencies.

&gt; Note: Flowistry type-checking results are cached in the `target/flowistry` directory. If you delete this folder, Flowistry will have to recompute types. Also for a large codebase this directory may take up a fair amount of disk space.

### Entering focus mode

Once Flowistry has booted up, the loading icon will disappear. Then you can enter focus mode by running the &quot;Toggle focus mode&quot; command. By default the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+R Ctrl+A (⌘+R ⌘+A on Mac), or you can use the Flowistry context menu:

&lt;kbd&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 52 39 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208449-83fceff7-86fe-4fe8-9fca-62552e6b0b43.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/kbd&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In focus mode, Flowistry will automatically compute the information flow within a given function once you put your cursor there. Once Flowistry has finished analysis, the status bar will look like this:

&lt;kbd&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;120&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 55 36 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208955-1f47ab0c-f3ae-4028-82b3-6f67e6fc0db7.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/kbd&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&gt; Note: Flowistry can be a bit slow for larger functions. It may take up to 15 seconds to finish the analysis.

Flowistry infers what you want to focus on based on your cursor. So if you click on a variable, you should see the focus region of that variable. Flowistry will highlight the focused code in gray, and then fade out code outside the focus region. For example, because the user&#039;s cursor is on `view_projection`, that variable is highlighted in gray, and its focus region is shown.

&lt;kbd&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;900&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 12 00 22 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155209805-75a23ed9-01ba-4100-b8bb-324b516f84cf.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/kbd&gt;

### Setting a mark

Sometimes you want to keep the focus region where it is, and click on other code to inspect it without changing focus. For this purpose, Flowistry has a concept of a &quot;mark&quot;. Once you have selected code to focus on, you can run the &quot;Set mark&quot; command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+S / ⌘+R ⌘+S). Then a mark is set at your cursor&#039;s current position, and the focus will stay there until you run the &quot;Unset mark&quot; command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+D / ⌘+R ⌘+D).

### Selecting the focus region

If you want to modify all the code in the focus region, e.g. to comment it out or copy it, then you can run the &quot;Select focused region&quot; command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+T / ⌘+R ⌘+T). This will add the entire focus region into your editor&#039;s selection.

## Limitations

Flowistry is an active research project into the applications of information flow analysis for Rust. It is continually evolving as we experiment with analysis techniques and interaction paradigms. So it&#039;s not quite as polished or efficient as tools like Rust Analyzer, but we hope you can still find it useful! Nevertheless, there are a number of important limitations you should understand when using Flowistry to avoid being surprised.

If you have questions or issues, please [file a Github issue](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry/issues), [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/XkcpkQn2Ah), or [DM @wcrichton on Twitter](https://twitter.com/wcrichton).

### Flowistry does not completely handle interior mutability

When your code has references, Flowistry needs to understand what that reference points-to. Flowistry uses Rust&#039;s lifetime information to determine points-to information. However, data structures that use interior mutability such as `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;` explicitly *do not* share lifetimes between pointers to the same data. For example, in this snippet:

```rust
let x = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
let y = x.clone();
*x.lock().unwrap() = 1;
println!(&quot;{}&quot;, y.lock().unwrap());
```

Flowistry *can* determine that `*x.lock().unwrap() = 1` is a mutation to `x`, but it *can not* determine that it is a mutation to `y`. So if you focus on `y`, the assignment to 1 would be faded out, even though it is relevant to the value of `y`.

We are researching methods to overcome this limitation, but for now just be aware that this is the main case where Flowistry is known to provide an incorrect answer.

### A focus region may include more code than you expect

Flowistry&#039;s analysis tries to include all code that *could* have an influence on a focal point. This analysis makes a number of assumptions for both practical and fundamental reasons. For example, in this snippet:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = v.get_mut(0);
println!(&quot;{:?} {}&quot;, v, x);
```

If you focus on `v` on line 3, it will include `v.get_mut(0)` as an operation that could have modified `v`. The reason is that Flowistry does not actually analyze the bodies of called functions, but rather approximates based on their type signatures. Because `get_mut` takes `&amp;mut self` as input, it assumes that the vector *could* be modified.

In general, you should use focus mode as a pruning tool. If code is faded out, then you don&#039;t have to read it (minus the limitation mentioned above!). If it isn&#039;t faded out, then it might be relevant to your task.

### Not all code is selectable

Flowistry works by analyzing the [MIR](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html) graph for a given function using the Rust compiler&#039;s API. Then the IDE extension lifts the analysis results from the MIR level back to the source level. However, a lot of information about the program is lost in the journey from source code to MIR.

For example, if the source contains an expression `foo.whomp.bar().baz()`, it&#039;s possible that a temporary variable is only generated for the expression `foo.whomp.bar()`. So if the user selects `foo`, Flowistry may not be able to determine that this corresponds to the MIR [place](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html) that represents `foo`.

This is why the IDE extension highlights the focused code in gray, so you can understand what your cursor&#039;s selection actually maps to.

### Nested functions cannot be analyzed together (including closures and async)

Flowistry analyzes a single function at a time. If a function contains other functions, e.g. `fn` definitions, or closures, or implicitly via async, then Flowistry will only show you focus regions within the smallest function body containing your cursor. This is usually well defined for function definitions and closures, but may be confusing for async since that depends on how rustc decides to carve up your async function.

## FAQ

### rustup fails on installation

If rustup fails, especially with an error like &quot;could not rename downloaded file&quot;, this is probably because Flowistry is running rustup concurrently with another tool (like rust-analyzer). Until [rustup#988](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/988) is resolved, there is unfortunately no automated way around this.

To solve the issue, go to the command line and run:

```
rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-08-25 -c rust-src -c rustc-dev -c llvm-tools-preview
```

Then go back to VSCode and click &quot;Continue&quot; to let Flowistry continue installing.

### Why isn&#039;t Flowistry part of Rust Analyzer?

Rust Analyzer does not support [MIR](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html) and the borrow checker, which are essential parts of Flowistry&#039;s analysis. That fact is unlikely to change for a [long time](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/185405-t-compiler.2Frust-analyzer/topic/How.20far.20is.20RA.20from.20MIR.3F), so Flowistry is a standalone tool.

### Why does Flowistry highlight (or not) this code?

See [Limitations](#limitations) for known issues. If that doesn&#039;t explain what you&#039;re seeing, please post it in the [unexpected highlights issue](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry/issues/36) or ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XkcpkQn2Ah).

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.

&gt; 🚧 **Beta Software**
&gt;
&gt; Rolldown is currently in beta status. While it can already handle most production use cases, there may still be bugs and rough edges. Most notably, the built-in minification feature is still in alpha status.

# Rolldown

Rolldown is a JavaScript/TypeScript bundler written in Rust intended to serve as the future bundler used in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It provides Rollup-compatible APIs and plugin interface, but will be more similar to esbuild in scope.

For more information, please check out the documentation at [rolldown.rs](https://rolldown.rs/about).

## VoidZero Inc.

Rolldown is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc).

If you have requirements for JavaScript tools at scale, please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/WQgjyzYJpwurpxWKA)!

# Installation

- Arch Linux: Install the package from official repositories: `pacman -S lact`
  (or `lact-git` from AUR for development builds).
- Debian/Ubuntu/Derivatives: Download a .deb from
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  It is only available on Debian 12+ and Ubuntu 22.04+ as older versions don&#039;t
  ship gtk4.
- Fedora: use the
  [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ilyaz/LACT/), or
  download an RPM from
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).
- Bazzite: Use the Flatpak below.

  This helper installs the Flatpak version and automatically adds the AMD
  overclocking boot option.
- Gentoo: Available in
  [GURU](https://github.com/gentoo/guru/tree/master/sys-apps/lact).
- OpenSUSE: an RPM is available in
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  Only tumbleweed is supported as leap does not have the required dependencies
  in the repos.
- NixOS: There is a package available in
  [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=24.05&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=packages&amp;query=lact)
- Flatpak (universal): Available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.ilya_zlobintsev.LACT) and in [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  See the [Flatpak documentation](./flatpak/README.md) for setup notes.
- Build from source.

Note: Nvidia support requires the Nvidia proprietary driver with CUDA libraries
installed.

## Development builds

To get latest fixes or features that have not yet been released in a stable
version, there are packages built from the latest commit that you can install
from the
[test release](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/test-build)
or using the `lact-git` AUR package on Arch-based distros.

Note: the date that GitHub shows next to the test release is not when the packages were built,
the actual date is specified next to the attached package files.

# Usage

Enable and start the service (otherwise you won&#039;t be able to change any
settings):

```
sudo systemctl enable --now lactd
```

You can now use the GUI to change settings and view information.

# Hardware support

See the
[Wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Hardware-Support)

# Configuration

There is a configuration file available in `/etc/lact/config.yaml`. Most of the
settings are accessible through the GUI, but some of them may be useful to be
edited manually (like `admin_group` and `admin_user` to specify who has access
to the daemon)

See [CONFIG.md](./docs/CONFIG.md) for more information.

**Socket permissions setup:**

By default, LACT uses either ether the `wheel` or `sudo` group (whichever is
available) for the ownership of the unix socket that the GUI needs to connect
to.

On most desktop configurations (such as the default setup on Arch-based, most
Debian-based or Fedora systems) this includes the default user, so you do not
need to configure this.

However, some systems may have different user configuration. In particular, this
has been reported to be a problem on OpenSUSE.

To fix socket permissions in such configurations, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml`
and under the `daemon` section either:

- Set `admin_user` to your username
- Set `admin_group` to a group that your user is a part of Then restart the
  service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

# Overclocking (AMD)

Some functionality requires enabling an option in the amdgpu driver, see the
[wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Overclocking-(AMD)) for
more information.

## Power profiles daemon note!

If you are using `power-profiles-daemon` (which is installed by default on many
distributions), by default it may override the amdgpu performance level setting
according to its own profile.

When using LACT 0.7.5+ and power-profiles-daemon 0.30+, LACT will try to connect to power-profiles-daemon 
and automatically disable the conflicting amdgpu action in ppd to avoid this conflict.

If running older versions, you can resolve this manually by creating a file at
`/etc/systemd/system/power-profiles-daemon.service.d/override.conf` with the
following contents:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/power-profiles-daemon --block-action=amdgpu_dpm
```

Note: the `/usr/libexec` path might be different on your system, check it in
`systemctl status power-profiles-daemon`

See https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/issues/370 for more information.

# Suspend/Resume

As some of the GPU settings may get reset when suspending the system, LACT will
reload them on system resume. This may not work on distributions which don&#039;t use
systemd, as it relies on the `org.freedesktop.login2` DBus interface.

# Building from source

Dependencies:

- rust 1.76+
- gtk 4.6+
- git
- pkg-config
- clang
- make
- hwdata
- libdrm
- vulkan-tools
- ocl-icd

Command to install all dependencies:

- Fedora:
  `sudo dnf install rust cargo make git clang gtk4-devel libdrm-devel vulkan-tools OpenCL-ICD-Loader-devel`
- Arch:
  `sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git clang make rust gtk4 hwdata vulkan-tools ocl-icd`

Steps:

- `git clone https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT &amp;&amp; cd LACT`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`

It&#039;s possible to change which features LACT gets built with. To do so, replace
the `make` command with the following variation:

Headless build with no GUI:

```
make build-release-headless
```

Build GUI with libadwaita support:

```
make build-release-libadwaita
```

# Remote management

It&#039;s possible to have the LACT daemon running on one machine, and then manage it
remotely from another.

This is disabled by default, as the TCP connection **does not have any
authentication or encryption mechanism!** Make sure to only use it in trusted
networks and/or set up appropriate firewall rules.

To enable it, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml` and add `tcp_listen_address` with
your desired address and in the `daemon` section.

Example:

```yaml
daemon:
  tcp_listen_address: 0.0.0.0:12853
  log_level: info
  admin_group: wheel
  disable_clocks_cleanup: false
```

After this restart the service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

To connect to a remote instance with the GUI, run it with
`lact gui --tcp-address 192.168.1.10:12853`.

# CLI

There is also a cli available.

- List system GPUs:

  `lact cli list-gpus`

          Example output:

          ```
          disabled
          ```

The functionality of the CLI is quite limited. If you want to integrate LACT
with some application/script, you should use the [API](API.md) instead.

# Reporting issues

When reporting issues, please include your system info and GPU model.

If you&#039;re having an issue with changing the GPU&#039;s configuration, it&#039;s highly
recommended to include a debug snapshot in the bug report. You can generate one
using the option in the dropdown menu:

![image](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/assets/22796665/36dda5e3-981b-47e7-914e-6e29f30616b4)

The snapshot is an archive which includes the SysFS that LACT uses to interact
with the GPU.

If there&#039;s a crash, run `lact gui` from the command line to get GUI logs, check
daemon logs in `journalctl -u lactd` for errors, and see `dmesg` for kernel logs
that might include information about driver and system issues.

## Introduction

Welcome to iceoryx2, the efficient, and ultra-low latency inter-process
communication middleware. This library is designed to provide you with fast and
reliable zero-copy and lock-free inter-process communication mechanisms.

So if you want to communicate efficiently between multiple processes or
applications iceoryx2 is for you. With iceoryx2, you can:

* Send huge amounts of data using a publish/subscribe, request/response,
  pipeline (planned) or blackboard pattern (planned), making it ideal
  for scenarios where large datasets need to be shared.
* Exchange signals through events, enabling quick and reliable signaling between
  processes.

iceoryx2 is based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and facilitates
seamless inter-process communication (IPC).

It is all about providing a seamless experience for inter-process communication,
featuring versatile messaging patterns. Whether you&#039;re diving into
publish-subscribe, events, request-response, or the promise of upcoming features
like pipelines, and blackboard, iceoryx2 has you covered.

One of the features of iceoryx2 is its consistently low transmission latency
regardless of payload size, ensuring a predictable and reliable communication
experience.

iceoryx2&#039;s origins can be traced back to
[iceoryx](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx). By overcoming past
technical debts and refining the architecture, iceoryx2 enables the modularity
we&#039;ve always desired.

In the near future, iceoryx2 is poised to support at least the same feature set
and platforms as [iceoryx](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx), ensuring
a seamless transition and offering enhanced capabilities for your inter-process
communication needs. So, if you&#039;re looking for lightning-fast, cross-platform
communication that doesn&#039;t compromise on performance or modularity, iceoryx2 is
your answer.

## Thanks To All Contributors

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to iceoryx2. Without their passion and
dedication, the project wouldn&#039;t thrive. A list of people who have committed
code can be found on [github](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/graphs/contributors).
However, contributions are not limited to code - testing the software, reporting
bugs, and spreading the word about iceoryx2 are all equally valuable. A big
thank you as well to those &#039;invisible&#039; contributors who play a crucial role
behind the scenes.
