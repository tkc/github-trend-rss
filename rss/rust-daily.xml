&lt;br /&gt;

SQLx is an async, pure Rust&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä†&lt;/sub&gt; SQL crate featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL.

-   **Truly Asynchronous**. Built from the ground-up using async/await for maximum concurrency.

-   **Compile-time checked queries** (if you want). See [SQLx is not an ORM](#sqlx-is-not-an-orm).

-   **Database Agnostic**. Support for [PostgreSQL], [MySQL], [MariaDB], [SQLite].
    -   [MSSQL] was supported prior to version 0.7, but has been removed pending a full rewrite of the driver as part of our [SQLx Pro initiative].

-   **Pure Rust**. The Postgres and MySQL/MariaDB drivers are written in pure Rust using **zero** unsafe&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä†‚Ä†&lt;/sub&gt; code.

-   **Runtime Agnostic**. Works on different runtimes ([`async-std`] / [`tokio`] / [`actix`]) and TLS backends ([`native-tls`], [`rustls`]).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;

‚Ä† The SQLite driver uses the libsqlite3 C library as SQLite is an embedded database (the only way
we could be pure Rust for SQLite is by porting _all_ of SQLite to Rust).

‚Ä†‚Ä† SQLx uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` unless the `sqlite` feature is enabled.
The SQLite driver directly invokes the SQLite3 API via `libsqlite3-sys`, which requires `unsafe`.

&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

---

-   Cross-platform. Being native Rust, SQLx will compile anywhere Rust is supported.

-   Built-in connection pooling with `sqlx::Pool`.

-   Row streaming. Data is read asynchronously from the database and decoded on demand.

-   Automatic statement preparation and caching. When using the high-level query API (`sqlx::query`), statements are
    prepared and cached per connection.

-   Simple (unprepared) query execution including fetching results into the same `Row` types used by
    the high-level API. Supports batch execution and returns results from all statements.

-   Transport Layer Security (TLS) where supported ([MySQL], [MariaDB] and [PostgreSQL]).

-   Asynchronous notifications using `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for [PostgreSQL].

-   Nested transactions with support for save points.

-   `Any` database driver for changing the database driver at runtime. An `AnyPool` connects to the driver indicated by the URL scheme.

## Install

SQLx is compatible with the [`async-std`], [`tokio`], and [`actix`] runtimes; and, the [`native-tls`] and [`rustls`] TLS backends. When adding the dependency, you must choose a runtime feature that is `runtime` + `tls`.

[`async-std`]: https://github.com/async-rs/async-std
[`tokio`]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio
[`actix`]: https://github.com/actix/actix-net
[`native-tls`]: https://crates.io/crates/native-tls
[`rustls`]: https://crates.io/crates/rustls

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
# PICK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

# tokio (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot; ] }
# tokio + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }

# async-std (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot; ] }
# async-std + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }
```

#### Cargo Feature Flags

For backward-compatibility reasons, the runtime and TLS features can either be chosen together as a single feature,
or separately.

For forward compatibility, you should use the separate runtime and TLS features as the combination features may
be removed in the future.

-   `runtime-async-std`: Use the `async-std` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-tokio`: Use the `tokio` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

    - Actix-web is fully compatible with Tokio and so a separate runtime feature is no longer needed.

-   `tls-native-tls`: Use the `native-tls` TLS backend (OpenSSL on *nix, SChannel on Windows, Secure Transport on macOS).

-   `tls-rustls`: Use the `rustls` TLS backend (cross-platform backend, only supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3).

-   `postgres`: Add support for the Postgres database server.

-   `mysql`: Add support for the MySQL/MariaDB database server.

-   `mssql`: Add support for the MSSQL database server.

-   `sqlite`: Add support for the self-contained [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database engine with SQLite bundled and statically-linked.

-   `sqlite-unbundled`: The same as above (`sqlite`), but link SQLite from the system instead of the bundled version.
    * Allows updating SQLite independently of SQLx or using forked versions.
    * You must have SQLite installed on the system or provide a path to the library at build time.
       See [the `rusqlite` README](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite?tab=readme-ov-file#notes-on-building-rusqlite-and-libsqlite3-sys) for details.
    * May result in link errors if the SQLite version is too old. Version `3.20.0` or newer is recommended.
    * Can increase build time due to the use of bindgen.

-   `sqlite-preupdate-hook`: enables SQLite&#039;s [preupdate hook](https://sqlite.org/c3ref/preupdate_count.html) API.
    * Exposed as a separate feature because it&#039;s generally not enabled by default.
    * Using this feature with `sqlite-unbundled` may cause linker failures if the system SQLite version does not support it.

-   `any`: Add support for the `Any` database driver, which can proxy to a database driver at runtime.

-   `derive`: Add support for the derive family macros, those are `FromRow`, `Type`, `Encode`, `Decode`.

-   `macros`: Add support for the `query*!` macros, which allows compile-time checked queries.

-   `migrate`: Add support for the migration management and `migrate!` macro, which allow compile-time embedded migrations.

-   `uuid`: Add support for UUID.

-   `chrono`: Add support for date and time types from `chrono`.

-   `time`: Add support for date and time types from `time` crate (alternative to `chrono`, which is preferred by `query!` macro, if both enabled)

-   `bstr`: Add support for `bstr::BString`.

-   `bigdecimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `bigdecimal` crate.

-   `rust_decimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `rust_decimal` crate.

-   `ipnet`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnet` crate.

-   `ipnetwork`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnetwork` crate.

-   `json`: Add support for `JSON` and `JSONB` (in postgres) using the `serde_json` crate.

-   Offline mode is now always enabled. See [sqlx-cli/README.md][readme-offline].

[readme-offline]: sqlx-cli/README.md#enable-building-in-offline-mode-with-query

## SQLx is not an ORM!

SQLx supports **compile-time checked queries**. It does not, however, do this by providing a Rust
API or DSL (domain-specific language) for building queries. Instead, it provides macros that take
regular SQL as input and ensure that it is valid for your database. The way this works is that
SQLx connects to your development DB at compile time to have the database itself verify (and return
some info on) your SQL queries. This has some potentially surprising implications:

- Since SQLx never has to parse the SQL string itself, any syntax that the development DB accepts
  can be used (including things added by database extensions)
- Due to the different amount of information databases let you retrieve about queries, the extent of
  SQL verification you get from the query macros depends on the database

**If you are looking for an (asynchronous) ORM,** you can check out our new [Ecosystem wiki page](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/wiki/Ecosystem#orms)!

## Usage

See the `examples/` folder for more in-depth usage.

### Quickstart

```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPoolOptions;
// use sqlx::mysql::MySqlPoolOptions;
// etc.

#[async_std::main] // Requires the `attributes` feature of `async-std`
// or #[tokio::main]
// or #[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    // Create a connection pool
    //  for MySQL/MariaDB, use MySqlPoolOptions::new()
    //  for SQLite, use SqlitePoolOptions::new()
    //  etc.
    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .connect(&quot;postgres://postgres:password@localhost/test&quot;).await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter (use a question mark `?` instead of `$1` for MySQL/MariaDB)
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as(&quot;SELECT $1&quot;)
        .bind(150_i64)
        .fetch_one(&amp;pool).await?;

    assert_eq!(row.0, 150);

    Ok(())
}
```


### Connecting

A single connection can be established using any of the database connection types and calling `connect()`.

```rust
use sqlx::Connection;

let conn = SqliteConnection::connect(&quot;sqlite::memory:&quot;).await?;
```

Generally, you will want to instead create a connection pool (`sqlx::Pool`) for the application to
regulate how many server-side connections it&#039;s using.

```rust
let pool = MySqlPool::connect(&quot;mysql://user:pass@host/database&quot;).await?;
```

### Querying

In SQL, queries can be separated into prepared (parameterized) or unprepared (simple). Prepared queries have their
query plan _cached_, use a binary mode of communication (lower bandwidth and faster decoding), and utilize parameters
to avoid SQL injection. Unprepared queries are simple and intended only for use where a prepared statement
will not work, such as various database commands (e.g., `PRAGMA` or `SET` or `BEGIN`).

SQLx supports all operations with both types of queries. In SQLx, a `&amp;str` is treated as an unprepared query,
and a `Query` or `QueryAs` struct is treated as a prepared query.

```rust
// low-level, Executor trait
conn.execute(&quot;BEGIN&quot;).await?; // unprepared, simple query
conn.execute(sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;)).await?; // prepared, cached query
```

We should prefer to use the high-level `query` interface whenever possible. To make this easier, there are finalizers
on the type to avoid the need to wrap with an executor.

```rust
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;mut conn).await?;
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;pool).await?;
```

The `execute` query finalizer returns the number of affected rows, if any, and drops all received results.
In addition, there are `fetch`, `fetch_one`, `fetch_optional`, and `fetch_all` to receive results.

The `Query` type returned from `sqlx::query` will return `Row&lt;&#039;conn&gt;` from the database. Column values can be accessed
by ordinal or by name with `row.get()`. As the `Row` retains an immutable borrow on the connection, only one
`Row` may exist at a time.

The `fetch` query finalizer returns a stream-like type that iterates through the rows in the result sets.

```rust
// provides `try_next`
use futures_util::TryStreamExt;
// provides `try_get`
use sqlx::Row;

let mut rows = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?&quot;)
    .bind(email)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);

while let Some(row) = rows.try_next().await? {
    // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    let email: &amp;str = row.try_get(&quot;email&quot;)?;
}
```

To assist with mapping the row into a domain type, one of two idioms may be used:

```rust
let mut stream = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
    .map(|row: PgRow| {
        // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    })
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct User { name: String, id: i64 }

let mut stream = sqlx::query_as::&lt;_, User&gt;(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? OR name = ?&quot;)
    .bind(user_email)
    .bind(user_name)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

Instead of a stream of results, we can use `fetch_one` or `fetch_optional` to request one required or optional result
from the database.

### Compile-time verification

We can use the macro, `sqlx::query!` to achieve compile-time syntactic and semantic verification of the SQL, with
an output to an anonymous record type where each SQL column is a Rust field (using raw identifiers where needed).

```rust
let countries = sqlx::query!(
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;{ country: String, count: i64 }&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

Differences from `query()`:

-   The input (or bind) parameters must be given all at once (and they are compile-time validated to be
    the right number and the right type).

-   The output type is an anonymous record. In the above example the type would be similar to:

    ```rust
    { country: String, count: i64 }
    ```

-   The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be set at build time to a database which it can prepare
    queries against; the database does not have to contain any data but must be the same
    kind (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) and have the same schema as the database you will be connecting to at runtime.

    For convenience, you can use [a `.env` file][dotenv]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to set DATABASE_URL so that you don&#039;t have to pass it every time:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mysql://localhost/my_database
    ```

[dotenv]: https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv#examples

The biggest downside to `query!()` is that the output type cannot be named (due to Rust not
officially supporting anonymous records). To address that, there is a `query_as!()` macro that is
mostly identical except that you can name the output type.

```rust
// no traits are needed
struct Country { country: String, count: i64 }

let countries = sqlx::query_as!(Country,
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;Country&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

To avoid the need of having a development database around to compile the project even when no
modifications (to the database-accessing parts of the code) are done, you can enable &quot;offline mode&quot;
to cache the results of the SQL query analysis using the `sqlx` command-line tool. See
[sqlx-cli/README.md](./sqlx-cli/README.md#enable-building-in-offline-mode-with-query).

Compile-time verified queries do quite a bit of work at compile time. Incremental actions like
`cargo check` and `cargo build` can be significantly faster when using an optimized build by
putting the following in your `Cargo.toml` (More information in the
[Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html) of The Cargo Book)

```toml
[profile.dev.package.sqlx-macros]
opt-level = 3
```

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The `dotenv` crate itself appears abandoned as of [December 2021](https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv/issues/74)
so we now use the `dotenvy` crate instead. The file format is the same.

## Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% Safe Rust.

If the `sqlite` feature is enabled, this is downgraded to `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` on the
`sqlx::sqlite` module. There are several places where we interact with the C SQLite API. We try to document each call for the invariants we&#039;re assuming. We absolutely welcome auditing of, and feedback on, our unsafe code usage.

brew install codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](./docs/authentication.md#usage-based-billing-alternative-use-an-openai-api-key). If you previously used an API key for usage-based billing, see the [migration steps](./docs/authentication.md#migrating-from-usage-based-billing-api-key). If you&#039;re having trouble with login, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Codex can access MCP servers. To configure them, refer to the [config docs](./docs/config.md#mcp_servers).

### Configuration

Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For full configuration options, see [Configuration](./docs/config.md).

&lt;!-- description:start --&gt;
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the
language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.

*prek* is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust.
It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it,
while also providing some additional long-requested features.
&lt;!-- description:end --&gt;

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; prek is not production-ready yet. Some subcommands and languages are not implemented. See the current gaps for drop-in parity: [TODO](https://prek.j178.dev/todo/).
&gt;
&gt; It&#039;s already being adopted by [some projects](#who-is-using-prek), please give it a try - we&#039;d love your feedback!

&lt;!-- features:start --&gt;
## Features

- üöÄ A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- ‚ö° [Faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and uses only half the disk space.
- üîÑ Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- üèóÔ∏è Built-in support for monorepos (i.e. [workspace mode](https://prek.j178.dev/workspace/)).
- üêç Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- üõ†Ô∏è Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- üì¶ [Built-in](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/) Rust-native implementation of some common hooks.
&lt;!-- features:end --&gt;

## How to migrate

prek is designed as a drop-in replacement:

- [Install prek](#installation)
- Replace `pre-commit` with `prek` in your commands
- Your existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` works unchanged

```console
$ prek run
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
typos....................................................................Passed
cargo fmt................................................................Passed
cargo clippy.............................................................Passed
```

For configuring `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and writing hooks, you can refer to the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) as prek is fully compatible with it.

&lt;!-- why:start --&gt;
## Why prek?

### prek is faster

- It is [multiple times faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and takes up half the disk space.
- It redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.
- Repositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.
- It uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.
- It implements some common hooks in Rust, [built in prek](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/), which are faster than their Python counterparts.

### prek provides a better user experience

- No need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.
- No hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.
- Built-in support for workspaces (or monorepos), each subproject can have its own `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
- `prek run` has some nifty improvements over `pre-commit run`, such as:
  - `prek run --directory &lt;dir&gt;` runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use `git ls-files -- &lt;dir&gt; | xargs pre-commit run --files` anymore.
  - `prek run --last-commit` runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.
  - `prek run [HOOK] [HOOK]` selects and runs multiple hooks.
- `prek list` command lists all available hooks, their ids, and descriptions, providing a better overview of the configured hooks.
- prek provides shell completions for `prek run &lt;hook_id&gt;` command, making it easier to run specific hooks without remembering their ids.

For more detailed improvements prek offers, take a look at [Difference from pre-commit](https://prek.j178.dev/diff/).

## Who is using prek?

prek is pretty new, but it is already being used or recommend by some projects and organizations:

- [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44995)

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn&#039;t be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I&#039;ve learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ ‚Äî the state of your application
* __Messages__ ‚Äî user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ ‚Äî a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ ‚Äî a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(&quot;A cool counter&quot;, Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

Read the [book], the [documentation], and the [examples] to learn more!

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

üìö [Documentation](https://docs.vortex.dev/) | üìä [Performance Benchmarks](https://bench.vortex.dev)

## Overview

Vortex is a next-generation columnar file format and toolkit designed for high-performance data processing.
It is the fastest and most extensible format for building data systems backed by object storage. It provides:

- **‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Performance**
  - 100x faster random access reads (vs. modern Apache Parquet)
  - 10-20x faster scans
  - 5x faster writes
  - Similar compression ratios
  - Efficient support for wide tables with zero-copy/zero-parse metadata

- **üîß Extensible Architecture**
  - Modeled after Apache DataFusion&#039;s extensible approach
  - Pluggable encoding system, type system, compression strategy, &amp; layout strategy
  - Zero-copy compatibility with Apache Arrow

- **üó≥Ô∏è Open Source, Neutral Governance**
  - A Linux Foundation (LF AI &amp; Data) Project
  - Apache-2.0 Licensed

- **‚ÜîÔ∏è Integrations**
  - Arrow, DataFusion, DuckDB, Spark, Pandas, Polars, &amp; more
  - Apache Iceberg (coming soon)

&gt; üü¢ **Development Status**: Library APIs may change from version to version, but we now consider
&gt; the file format &lt;ins&gt;*stable*&lt;/ins&gt;. From release 0.36.0, all future releases of Vortex should
&gt; maintain backwards compatibility of the file format (i.e., be able to read files written by
&gt; any earlier version &gt;= 0.36.0).

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities

- ‚ú® **Logical Types** - Clean separation between logical schema and physical layout
- üîÑ **Zero-Copy Arrow Integration** - Seamless conversion to/from Apache Arrow arrays
- üß© **Extensible Encodings** - Pluggable physical layouts with built-in optimizations
- üì¶ **Cascading Compression** - Support for nested encoding schemes
- üöÄ **High-Performance Computing** - Optimized compute kernels for encoded data
- üìä **Rich Statistics** - Lazy-loaded summary statistics for optimization

### Technical Architecture

#### Logical vs Physical Design

Vortex strictly separates logical and physical concerns:

- **Logical Layer**: Defines data types and schema
- **Physical Layer**: Handles encoding and storage implementation
- **Built-in Encodings**: Compatible with Apache Arrow&#039;s memory format
- **Extension Encodings**: Optimized compression schemes (RLE, dictionary, etc.)

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Rust Crate

All features are exported through the main `vortex` crate.

```bash
cargo add vortex
```

#### Python Package

```bash
uv add vortex-data
```

#### Command Line UI (vx)

For browsing the structure of Vortex files, you can use the `vx` command-line tool.

```bash
# Install latest release
cargo install vortex-tui --locked

# Or build from source
cargo install --path vortex-tui --locked

# Usage
vx browse &lt;file&gt;
```

### Development Setup

#### Prerequisites (macOS)

```bash
# Optional but recommended dependencies
brew install flatbuffers protobuf  # For .fbs and .proto files
brew install duckdb               # For benchmarks

# Install Rust toolchain
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# or
brew install rustup

# Initialize submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Setup dependencies with uv
uv sync --all-packages
```

### Performance Optimization

For optimal performance, we suggest using [MiMalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc):

```rust,ignore
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL_ALLOC: MiMalloc = MiMalloc;
```

## Status

This project has reached a minimum-viable-product level of quality. Many people use it as their daily driver, but it may be unstable for some commands. Nu&#039;s design is subject to change as it matures.

## Learning About Nu

The [Nushell book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/) is the primary source of Nushell documentation. You can find [a full list of Nu commands in the book](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/), and we have many examples of using Nu in our [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/).

We&#039;re also active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn); come and chat with us!

## Installation

To quickly install Nu:

```bash
# Linux and macOS
brew install nushell
# Windows
winget install nushell
```

To use `Nu` in GitHub Action, check [setup-nu](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nu) for more detail.

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [installation chapter of the book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html). Nu is available via many package managers:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nushell.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions)

For details about which platforms the Nushell team actively supports, see [our platform support policy](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

## Configuration

The default configurations can be found at [sample_config](crates/nu-utils/src/default_files)
which are the configuration files one gets when they startup Nushell for the first time.

It sets all of the default configuration to run Nushell.  From here one can
then customize this file for their specific needs.

To see where *config.nu* is located on your system simply type this command.

```rust
$nu.config-path
```

Please see our [book](https://www.nushell.sh) for all of the Nushell documentation.


## Philosophy

Nu draws inspiration from projects like PowerShell, functional programming languages, and modern CLI tools.
Rather than thinking of files and data as raw streams of text, Nu looks at each input as something with structure.
For example, when you list the contents of a directory what you get back is a table of rows, where each row represents an item in that directory.
These values can be piped through a series of steps, in a series of commands called a &#039;pipeline&#039;.

### Pipelines

In Unix, it&#039;s common to pipe between commands to split up a sophisticated command over multiple steps.
Nu takes this a step further and builds heavily on the idea of _pipelines_.
As in the Unix philosophy, Nu allows commands to output to stdout and read from stdin.
Additionally, commands can output structured data (you can think of this as a third kind of stream).
Commands that work in the pipeline fit into one of three categories:

-   Commands that produce a stream (e.g., `ls`)
-   Commands that filter a stream (e.g., `where type == &quot;dir&quot;`)
-   Commands that consume the output of the pipeline (e.g., `table`)

Commands are separated by the pipe symbol (`|`) to denote a pipeline flowing left to right.

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot; | table

```

Because most of the time you&#039;ll want to see the output of a pipeline, `table` is assumed.
We could have also written the above:

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot;
```

Being able to use the same commands and compose them differently is an important philosophy in Nu.
For example, we could use the built-in `ps` command to get a list of the running processes, using the same `where` as above.

```shell
ps | where cpu &gt; 0
# =&gt; ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ

```

### Opening files

Nu can load file and URL contents as raw text or structured data (if it recognizes the format).
For example, you can load a .toml file as structured data and explore it:

```shell
open Cargo.toml
# =&gt; ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ bin              ‚îÇ [table 1 row]      ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ dependencies     ‚îÇ {record 25 fields} ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ dev-dependencies ‚îÇ {record 8 fields}  ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ features         ‚îÇ {record 10 fields} ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ package          ‚îÇ {record 13 fields} ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ patch            ‚îÇ {record 1 field}   ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ profile          ‚îÇ {record 3 fields}  ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ target           ‚îÇ {record 3 fields}  ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ workspace        ‚îÇ {record 1 field}   ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïØ
```

We can pipe this into a command that gets the contents of one of the columns:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package
# =&gt; ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ

```

And if needed we can drill down further:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package.version
# =&gt; 0.72.0
```

### Plugins

Nu supports plugins that offer additional functionality to the shell and follow the same structured data model that built-in commands use. There are a few examples in the `crates/nu_plugins_*` directories.

Plugins are binaries that are available in your path and follow a `nu_plugin_*` naming convention.
These binaries interact with nu via a simple JSON-RPC protocol where the command identifies itself and passes along its configuration, making it available for use.
If the plugin is a filter, data streams to it one element at a time, and it can stream data back in return via stdin/stdout.
If the plugin is a sink, it is given the full vector of final data and is given free reign over stdin/stdout to use as it pleases.

The [awesome-nu repo](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu#plugins) lists a variety of nu-plugins while the [showcase repo](https://github.com/nushell/showcase) *shows* off informative blog posts that have been written about Nushell along with videos that highlight technical
topics that have been presented.

## Goals

Nu adheres closely to a set of goals that make up its design philosophy. As features are added, they are checked against these goals.

-   First and foremost, Nu is cross-platform. Commands and techniques should work across platforms and Nu has [first-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

-   Nu ensures compatibility with existing platform-specific executables.

-   Nu&#039;s workflow and tools should have the usability expected of modern software in 2022 (and beyond).

-   Nu views data as either structured or unstructured. It is a structured shell like PowerShell.

-   Finally, Nu views data functionally. Rather than using mutation, pipelines act as a means to load, change, and save data without mutable state.

```

## Sui Overview

Sui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of authorities that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.

Sui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for common use cases. Sui makes the vast majority of transactions processable in parallel, which makes better use of processing resources, and offers the option to increase throughput with more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for common use cases, such as payment transactions and asset transfers. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications, ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.

Sui is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and supports smart contracts written in the [Move programming language](https://github.com/move-language/move) to define assets that may have an owner. Move programs define operations on these assets including custom rules for their creation, the transfer of these assets to new owners, and operations that mutate assets.

Sui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and is also used as [delegated stake on authorities](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos/) within an epoch. The voting power of authorities within this epoch is a function of this delegated stake. Authorities are periodically reconfigured according to the stake delegated to them. In any epoch, the set of authorities is [Byzantine fault tolerant](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to authorities according to their contribution to the operation of the system. Authorities can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that delegated stakes to them.

Sui is supported by several cutting-edge [peer-reviewed studies](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/concepts/research-papers.mdx) and extensive years of open-source development.

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html

### Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways you can contribute to Zed.

Also... we&#039;re hiring! Check out our [jobs](https://zed.dev/jobs) page for open roles.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cargo

Cargo downloads your Rust project‚Äôs dependencies and compiles your project.

**To start using Cargo**, learn more at [The Cargo Book].

**To start developing Cargo itself**, read the [Cargo Contributor Guide].

[The Cargo Book]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
[Cargo Contributor Guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo/contrib/

&gt; The Cargo binary distributed through with Rust is maintained by the Cargo
&gt; team for use by the wider ecosystem.
&gt; For all other uses of this crate (as a binary or library) this is maintained
&gt; by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo and not intended for external
&gt; use (except as a transitive dependency). This crate may make major changes to
&gt; its APIs.

## Code Status

[![CI](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=auto-cargo)](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Code documentation: &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/&gt;

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `cargo` and `rustc`
* A C compiler [for your platform](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)
* `git` (to clone this repository)

**Other requirements:**

The following are optional based on your platform and needs.

* `pkg-config` ‚Äî This is used to help locate system packages, such as `libssl` headers/libraries. This may not be required in all cases, such as using vendored OpenSSL, or on Windows.
* OpenSSL ‚Äî Only needed on Unix-like systems and only if the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature is not used.

  This requires the development headers, which can be obtained from the `libssl-dev` package on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` with apk or yum or the `openssl` package from Homebrew on macOS.

  If using the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature, then a static copy of OpenSSL will be built from source instead of using the system OpenSSL.
  This may require additional tools such as `perl` and `make`.

  On macOS, common installation directories from Homebrew, MacPorts, or pkgsrc will be checked. Otherwise it will fall back to `pkg-config`.

  On Windows, the system-provided Schannel will be used instead.

  LibreSSL is also supported.

**Optional system libraries:**

The build will automatically use vendored versions of the following libraries. However, if they are provided by the system and can be found with `pkg-config`, then the system libraries will be used instead:

* [`libcurl`](https://curl.se/libcurl/) ‚Äî Used for network transfers.
* [`libgit2`](https://libgit2.org/) ‚Äî Used for fetching git dependencies.
* [`libssh2`](https://www.libssh2.org/) ‚Äî Used for SSH access to git repositories.
* [`libz`](https://zlib.net/) (AKA zlib) ‚Äî Used by the above C libraries for data compression. (Rust code uses [`zlib-rs`](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/zlib-rs) instead.)

It is recommended to use the vendored versions as they are the versions that are tested to work with Cargo.

### Compiling

First, you&#039;ll want to check out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo.git
cd cargo
```

With `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.

[third-party-subcommands]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-cargo-subcommands


## Releases

Cargo releases coincide with Rust releases.
High level release notes are available as part of [Rust&#039;s release notes][rel].
Detailed release notes are available in the [changelog].

[rel]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md

## Yazi - ‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

üí° A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- üöÄ **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- üí™ **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- üñºÔ∏è **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with √úberzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- üåü **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- üîå **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- üì° **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- üì¶ **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- üß∞ Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- üí´ Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- üîÑ Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- üé® Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, Virtual Filesystem, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

This is the OpenVAS Scanner of the Greenbone Community Edition.

It is used for the Greenbone Enterprise appliances and is a full-featured
scan engine that executes a continuously updated and extended feed of
Vulnerability Tests (VTs).

## Releases

All [release files](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas/releases) are signed with
the [Greenbone Community Feed integrity key](https://community.greenbone.net/t/gcf-managing-the-digital-signatures/101).
This gpg key can be downloaded at https://www.greenbone.net/GBCommunitySigningKey.asc
and the fingerprint is `8AE4 BE42 9B60 A59B 311C  2E73 9823 FAA6 0ED1 E580`.

## Installation

This module can be configured, built and installed with following commands:

    cmake .
    make install

For detailed installation requirements and instructions, please see the file
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). The file also contains instructions for setting up
`openvas` and for making the scanner available to other GVM modules.

If you are not familiar or comfortable building from source code, we recommend
that you use the Greenbone Enterprise TRIAL, a prepared virtual
machine with a readily available setup. Information regarding the virtual machine
is available at &lt;https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow&gt;.

## Rust Implementation

This repository also consists of a [rust project](rust/README.md) aiming to replace the current scanner stack
(openvas-scanner, ospd-openvas, notus-scanner). It simplifies the use of the scanner and centralizes
everything needed for scanning. Currently it uses the openvas-scanner as scan engine.

## Docker, [Greenbone Community Containers](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/container/)

If you want to use the docker files provided in this repository you can pull them from the [Greenbone registry](registry.community.greenbone.net/community/openvas-scanner:stable). You can also locally build them using:
```
docker build -t &lt;image-name&gt; -f .docker/prod.Dockerfile .
```
For more information about building docker images, see 
[official man](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).
We also provide a [fully containerized

## Polars: Extremely fast Query Engine for DataFrames, written in Rust

Polars is an analytical query engine written for DataFrames. It is designed to be fast, easy to use
and expressive. Key features are:

- Lazy | Eager execution
- Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Query optimization
- Multi-threaded
- Written in Rust
- SIMD
- Powerful expression API
- Front end in Python | Rust | NodeJS | R | SQL
- [Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Performance üöÄüöÄ

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming.

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

## Managed/Distributed Polars

Do you want a managed solution or scale out to distributed clusters? Consider our
[offering](https://cloud.pola.rs/) and help the project!

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars[rt64]`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars[rtcompat]`. This version of
Polars is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target
features.

Build and publish crates with [pyo3, cffi and uniffi bindings](https://maturin.rs/bindings) as well as rust binaries as python packages with minimal configuration.
It supports building wheels for python 3.8+ on Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD, can upload them to [pypi](https://pypi.org/) and has basic PyPy and GraalPy support.

Check out the [User Guide](https://maturin.rs/)!

## Usage

You can either download binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/releases/latest) or install it with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```shell
# pipx
pipx install maturin
# uv
uv tool install maturin
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; `pip install maturin` should also work if you don&#039;t want to use pipx.

There are four main commands:

- `maturin new` creates a new cargo project with maturin configured.
- `maturin publish` builds the crate into python packages and publishes them to pypi.
- `maturin build` builds the wheels and stores them in a folder (`target/wheels` by default), but doesn&#039;t upload them. It&#039;s recommended to publish packages with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) using `uv publish`.
- `maturin develop` builds the crate and installs it as a python module directly in the current virtualenv. Note that while `maturin develop` is faster, it doesn&#039;t support all the feature that running `pip install` after `maturin build` supports.

maturin doesn&#039;t need extra configuration files and doesn&#039;t clash with an existing setuptools-rust configuration.
You can even integrate it with testing tools such as [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
There are examples for the different bindings in the `test-crates` folder.

The name of the package will be the name of the cargo project, i.e. the name field in the `[package]` section of `Cargo.toml`.
The name of the module, which you are using when importing, will be the `name` value in the `[lib]` section (which defaults to the name of the package). For binaries, it&#039;s simply the name of the binary generated by cargo.

When using `maturin build` and `maturin develop` commands, you can compile a performance-optimized program by adding the `-r` or `--release` flag.

## Python packaging basics

Python packages come in two formats:
A built form called wheel and source distributions (sdist), both of which are archives.
A wheel can be compatible with any python version, interpreter (cpython and pypy, mainly), operating system and hardware architecture (for pure python wheels),
can be limited to a specific platform and architecture (e.g. when using ctypes or cffi) or to a specific python interpreter and version on a specific architecture and operating system (e.g. with pyo3).

When using `pip install` on a package, pip tries to find a matching wheel and install that. If it doesn&#039;t find one, it downloads the source distribution and builds a wheel for the current platform,
which requires the right compilers to be installed. Installing a wheel is much faster than installing a source distribution as building wheels is generally slow.

When you publish a package to be installable with `pip install`, you upload it to [pypi](https://pypi.org/), the official package repository.
For testing, you can use [test pypi](https://test.pypi.org/) instead, which you can use with `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/`.
Note that for [publishing for linux](#manylinux-and-auditwheel), you need to use the manylinux docker container or zig, while for publishing from your repository you can use the [PyO3/maturin-action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action) github action.

## Mixed rust/python projects

To create a mixed rust/python project, create a folder with your module name (i.e. `lib.name` in Cargo.toml) next to your Cargo.toml and add your python sources there:

```
my-project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_project
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bar.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs
```

You can specify a different python source directory in `pyproject.toml` by setting `tool.maturin.python-source`, for example

**pyproject.toml**

```toml
[tool.maturin]
python-source = &quot;python&quot;
module-name = &quot;my_project._lib_name&quot;
```

then the project structure would look like this:

```
my-project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_project
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bar.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; This structure is recommended to avoid [a common `ImportError` pitfall](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/issues/490)

maturin will add the native extension as a module in your python folder. When using develop, maturin will copy the native library and for cffi also the glue code to your python folder. You should add those files to your gitignore.

With cffi you can do `from .my_project import lib` and then use `lib.my_native_function`, with pyo3 you can directly `from .my_project import my_native_function`.

Example layout with pyo3 after `maturin develop`:

```
my-project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_project
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bar.py
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _lib_name.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs
```

When doing this also be sure to set the module name in your code to match the last part of `module-name` (don&#039;t include the package path):

```rust
#[pymodule]
#[pyo3(name=&quot;_lib_name&quot;)]
fn my_lib_name(m: &amp;Bound&lt;&#039;_, PyModule&gt;) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_class::&lt;MyPythonRustClass&gt;()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Python metadata

maturin supports [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/), you can specify python package metadata in `pyproject.toml`.
maturin merges metadata from `Cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml`, `pyproject.toml` takes precedence over `Cargo.toml`.

To specify python dependencies, add a list `dependencies` in a `[project]` section in the `pyproject.toml`. This list is equivalent to `install_requires` in setuptools:

```toml
[project]
name = &quot;my-project&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;flask~=1.1.0&quot;, &quot;toml&gt;=0.10.2,&lt;0.11.0&quot;]
```

You can add so called console scripts, which are shell commands that execute some function in your program in the `[project.scripts]` section.
The keys are the script names while the values are the path to the function in the format `some.module.path:class.function`, where the `class` part is optional. The function is called with no arguments. Example:

```toml
[project.scripts]
get_42 = &quot;my_project:DummyClass.get_42&quot;
```

You can also specify [trove classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) in your `pyproject.toml` under `project.classifiers`:

```toml
[project]
name = &quot;my-project&quot;
classifiers = [&quot;Programming Language :: Python&quot;]
```

## Source distribution

maturin supports building through `pyproject.toml`. To use it, create a `pyproject.toml` next to your `Cargo.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = [&quot;maturin&gt;=1.0,&lt;2.0&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;maturin&quot;
```

If a `pyproject.toml` with a `[build-system]` entry is present, maturin can build a source distribution of your package when `--sdist` is specified.
The source distribution will contain the same files as `cargo package`. To only build a source distribution, pass `--interpreter` without any values.

You can then e.g. install your package with `pip install .`. With `pip install . -v` you can see the output of cargo and maturin.

You can use the options `compatibility`, `skip-auditwheel`, `bindings`, `strip` and common Cargo build options such as `features` under `[tool.maturin]` the same way you would when running maturin directly.
The `bindings` key is required for cffi and bin projects as those can&#039;t be automatically detected. Currently, all builds are in release mode (see [this thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-517-debug-vs-release-builds/1924) for details).

For a non-manylinux build with cffi bindings you could use the following:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = [&quot;maturin&gt;=1.0,&lt;2.0&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;maturin&quot;

[tool.maturin]
bindings = &quot;cffi&quot;
compatibility = &quot;linux&quot;
```

`manylinux` option is also accepted as an alias of `compatibility` for backward compatibility with old version of maturin.

To include arbitrary files in the sdist for use during compilation specify `include` as an array of `path` globs with `format` set to `sdist`:

```toml
[tool.maturin]
include = [{ path = &quot;path/**/*&quot;, format = &quot;sdist&quot; }]
```

There&#039;s a `maturin sdist` command for only building a source distribution as workaround for [pypa/pip#6041](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6041).

## Manylinux and auditwheel

For portability reasons, native python modules on linux must only dynamically link a set of very few libraries which are installed basically everywhere, hence the name manylinux.
The pypa offers special docker images and a tool called [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/) to ensure compliance with the [manylinux rules](https://peps.python.org/pep-0599/#the-manylinux2014-policy).
If you want to publish widely usable wheels for linux pypi, **you need to use a manylinux docker image or build with zig**.

The Rust compiler since version 1.64 [requires at least glibc 2.17](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/08/01/Increasing-glibc-kernel-requirements.html), so you need to use at least manylinux2014.
For publishing, we recommend enforcing the same manylinux version as the image with the manylinux flag, e.g. use `--manylinux 2014` if you are building in `quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64`.
The [PyO3/maturin-action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action) github action already takes care of this if you set e.g. `manylinux: 2014`.

maturin contains a reimplementation of auditwheel automatically checks the generated library and gives the wheel the proper platform tag.
If your system&#039;s glibc is too new or you link other shared libraries, it will assign the `linux` tag.
You can also manually disable those checks and directly use native linux target with `--manylinux off`.

For full manylinux compliance you need to compile in a CentOS docker container. The [pyo3/maturin](https://ghcr.io/pyo3/maturin) image is based on the manylinux2014 image,
and passes arguments to the `maturin` binary. You can use it like this:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/io ghcr.io/pyo3/maturin build --release  # or other maturin arguments
```

Note that this image is very basic and only contains python, maturin and stable rust. If you need additional tools, you can run commands inside the manylinux container.
See [konstin/complex-manylinux-maturin-docker](https://github.com/konstin/complex-manylinux-maturin-docker) for a small educational example or [nanoporetech/fast-ctc-decode](https://github.com/nanoporetech/fast-ctc-decode/blob/b226ea0f2b2f4f474eff47349703d57d2ea4801b/.github/workflows/publish.yml) for a real world setup.

maturin itself is manylinux compliant when compiled for the musl target.

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

# RMCP
[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rmcp)](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp)
&lt;!-- ![Release status](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg) --&gt;
&lt;!-- [![docs.rs](todo)](todo) --&gt;
![Coverage](docs/coverage.svg)

An official Rust Model Context Protocol SDK implementation with tokio async runtime.

This repository contains the following crates:

- [rmcp](crates/rmcp): The core crate providing the RMCP protocol implementation (If you want to get more information, please visit [rmcp](crates/rmcp/README.md))
- [rmcp-macros](crates/rmcp-macros): A procedural macro crate for generating RMCP tool implementations (If you want to get more information, please visit [rmcp-macros](crates/rmcp-macros/README.md))

## Usage

### Import the crate

```toml
rmcp = { version = &quot;0.8.0&quot;, features = [&quot;server&quot;] }
## or dev channel
rmcp = { git = &quot;https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk&quot;, branch = &quot;main&quot; }
```
### Third Dependencies
Basic dependencies:
- [tokio required](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
- [serde required](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)



### Build a Client
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Start a client&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
use rmcp::{ServiceExt, transport::{TokioChildProcess, ConfigureCommandExt}};
use tokio::process::Command;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = ().serve(TokioChildProcess::new(Command::new(&quot;npx&quot;).configure(|cmd| {
        cmd.arg(&quot;-y&quot;).arg(&quot;@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything&quot;);
    }))?).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

### Build a Server

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Build a transport&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
use tokio::io::{stdin, stdout};
let transport = (stdin(), stdout());
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Build a service&lt;/summary&gt;

You can easily build a service by using [`ServerHandler`](crates/rmcp/src/handler/server.rs) or [`ClientHandler`](crates/rmcp/src/handler/client.rs).

```rust, ignore
let service = common::counter::Counter::new();
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Start the server&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
// this call will finish the initialization process
let server = service.serve(transport).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Interact with the server&lt;/summary&gt;

Once the server is initialized, you can send requests or notifications:

```rust, ignore
// request
let roots = server.list_roots().await?;

// or send notification
server.notify_cancelled(...).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Waiting for service shutdown&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
let quit_reason = server.waiting().await?;
// or cancel it
let quit_reason = server.cancel().await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Pyrefly: A fast type checker and language server for Python with powerful IDE features

[![pyrefly](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://pyrefly.org/badge.json)](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyrefly.svg?color=blue)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrefly)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/Cf7mFQtW7W)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Pyrefly is a type checker and language server for Python, which provides
lightning-fast type checking along with IDE features such as code navigation,
semantic highlighting, and code completion. It is available as a
[command-line tool](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/installation/) and a
[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly).

See the [Pyrefly website](https://pyrefly.org) for full documentation and how to
add Pyrefly to your editor of choice.

Currently under active development with known issues. Please open an issue if
you find bugs.

### Getting Started

- Try out pyrefly in your browser: [Sandbox](https://pyrefly.org/sandbox/)
- Get the command-line tool: `pip install pyrefly`
- Get the VSCode extension:
  [Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly)

### Key Features:

- Type Inference: Pyrefly infers types in most locations, apart from function
  parameters. It can infer types of variables and return types.
- Flow Types: Pyrefly can understand your program&#039;s control flow to refine
  static types.
- Incrementality: Pyrefly aims for large-scale incrementality at the module
  level, with optimized checking and parallelism.

## Getting Involved

and types. This is also where we hold biweekly office hours.

## Choices

There are a number of choices when writing a Python type checker. We are taking
inspiration from [Pyre1](https://pyre-check.org/),
[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) and
[MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Some notable choices:

- We infer types in most locations, apart from parameters to functions. We do
  infer types of variables and return types. As an example,
  `def foo(x): return True` would result in something equivalent to had you
  written `def foo(x: Any) -&gt; bool: ...`.
- We attempt to infer the type of `[]` to however it is used first, then fix it
  after. For example `xs = []; xs.append(1); xs.append(&quot;&quot;)` will infer that
  `xs: List[int]` and then error on the final statement.
- We use flow types which refine static types, e.g. `x: int = 4` will both know
  that `x` has type `int`, but also that the immediately next usage of `x` will
  be aware the type is `Literal[4]`.
- We aim for large-scale incrementality (at the module level) and optimized
  checking with parallelism, aiming to use the advantages of Rust to keep the
  code a bit simpler.
- We expect large strongly connected components of modules, and do not attempt
  to take advantage of a DAG-shape in the source code.

## Code layout

Pyrefly is split into a number of crates (mostly under `crates/`):

- `pyrefly_util` are general purpose utilities, which have nothing to do with
  Python or type checking. Examples include IO wrappers, locking, command line
  helpers etc.
- `pyrefly_derive` are proc-macros for deriving traits such as `TypeEq` and
  `Visit`.
- `pyrefly_python` are Python utilities with no type-checking aspects, such as
  modelling modules or `sys.info`.
- `pyrefly_bundled` are the third-party
  [typeshed stubs](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
- `pyrefly_config` defines the Pyrefly configuration, along with support for
  reading Mypy/Pyright configuration.
- `pyrefly_types` defines the Pyrefly type along with operations on it.
- `pyrefly_wasm` defines the sandbox code that compiles to WASM.
- `pyrefly` itself is the type checker and everything else.

## Design

There are many nuances of design that change on a regular basis. But the basic
substrate on which the checker is built involves three steps:

1. Figure out what each module exports. That requires solving all `import *`
   statements transitively.
2. For each module in isolation, convert it to bindings, dealing with all
   statements and scope information (both static and flow).
3. Solve those bindings, which may require the solutions of bindings in other
   modules.

If we encounter unknowable information (e.g. recursion) we use `Type::Var` to
insert placeholders which are filled in later.

For each module, we solve the steps sequentially and completely. In particular,
we do not try and solve a specific identifier first (like
[Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)), and do not use fine-grained
incrementality (like [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
using [Salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa)). Instead, we aim for raw
performance and a simpler module-centric design - there&#039;s no need to solve a
single binding in isolation if solving all bindings in a module is fast enough.

### Example of bindings

Given the program:

```python
1: x: int = 4
2: print(x)
```

We might produce the bindings:

- `define int@0` = `from builtins import int`
- `define x@1` = `4: int@0`
- `use x@2` = `x@1`
- `anon @2` = `print(x@2)`
- `export x` = `x@2`

Of note:

- The keys are things like `define` (the definition of something), `use` (a
  usage of a thing) and `anon` (a statement we need to type check, but don&#039;t
  care about the result of).
- In many cases the value of a key refers to other keys.
- Some keys are imported from other modules, via `export` keys and `import`
  values.
- In order to disambiguate identifiers we use the textual position at which they
  occur (in the example we&#039;ve used `@line`, but in reality it&#039;s the byte offset
  in the file).

### Example of `Var`

Given the program:

```python
1: x = 1
2: while test():
3:     x = x
4: print(x)
```

We end up with the bindings:

- `x@1` = `1`
- `x@3` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`
- `x@4` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`

The expression `phi` is the join point of the two values, e.g. `phi(int, str)`
would be `int | str`. We skip the distinction between `define` and `use`, since
it is not necessary for this example.

When solving `x@3` we encounter recursion. Operationally:

- We start solving `x@3`.
- That requires us to solve `x@1`.
- We solve `x@1` to be `Literal[1]`
- We start solving `x@3`. But we are currently solving `x@3`, so we invent a
  fresh `Var` (let&#039;s call it `?1`) and return that.
- We conclude that `x@3` must be `Literal[1] | ?1`.
- Since `?1` was introduced by `x@3` we record that `?1 = Literal[1] | ?1`. We
  can take the upper reachable bound of that and conclude that
  `?1 = Literal[1]`.
- We simplify `x@3` to just `Literal[1]`.

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Provides an implementation of today&#039;s most used tokenizers, with a focus on performance and
versatility.

## Main features:

 - Train new vocabularies and tokenize, using today&#039;s most used tokenizers.
 - Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation. Takes
   less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server&#039;s CPU.
 - Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.
 - Designed for research and production.
 - Normalization comes with alignments tracking. It&#039;s always possible to get the part of the
   original sentence that corresponds to a given token.
 - Does all the pre-processing: Truncate, Pad, add the special tokens your model needs.

## Performances
Performances can vary depending on hardware, but running the [~/bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py](bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py) should give the following on a g6 aws instance:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b913d4b-e488-4cbc-b542-f90a6c40643d)


## Bindings

We provide bindings to the following languages (more to come!):
  - [Rust](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/tokenizers) (Original implementation)
  - [Python](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/python)
  - [Node.js](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/node)
  - [Ruby](https://github.com/ankane/tokenizers-ruby) (Contributed by @ankane, external repo)

## Installation

You can install from source using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers.git#subdirectory=bindings/python
```

or install the released versions with

```bash
pip install tokenizers
```
 
## Quick example using Python:

Choose your model between Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece or Unigram and instantiate a tokenizer:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE

tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())
```

You can customize how pre-tokenization (e.g., splitting into words) is done:

```python
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()
```

Then training your tokenizer on a set of files just takes two lines of codes:

```python
from tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer

trainer = BpeTrainer(special_tokens=[&quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;[CLS]&quot;, &quot;[SEP]&quot;, &quot;[PAD]&quot;, &quot;[MASK]&quot;])
tokenizer.train(files=[&quot;wiki.train.raw&quot;, &quot;wiki.valid.raw&quot;, &quot;wiki.test.raw&quot;], trainer=trainer)
```

Once your tokenizer is trained, encode any text with just one line:
```python
output = tokenizer.encode(&quot;Hello, y&#039;all! How are you üòÅ ?&quot;)
print(output.tokens)
# [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;&#039;&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;How&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;?&quot;]
```

OpenDAL (`/Àào ä.p…ôn.d√¶l/`, pronounced &quot;OH-puhn-dal&quot;) is an Open Data Access Layer that enables seamless interaction with diverse storage services.

OpenDAL&#039;s development is guided by its vision of **One Layer, All Storage** and its core principles: **Open Community**, **Solid Foundation**, **Fast Access**, **Object Storage First**, and **Extensible Architecture**. Read the explained vision at [OpenDAL Vision](https://opendal.apache.org/vision).

This is Lakekeeper: An Apache-Licensed, **secure**, **fast** and **easy to use**  implementation of the [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) REST Catalog specification based on [apache/iceberg-rust](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-rust). If you have questions, feature requests or just want a chat, we are hanging around in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jkAGG8p93B)!

# Quickstart

A Docker Container is available on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/lakekeeper/catalog?tab=info).
We have prepared a minimal docker-compose file to demonstrate how to use the Lakekeeper catalog with common query engines.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper.git
cd lakekeeper/examples/minimal
docker compose up
```

Then open your browser and head to [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to load the example Jupyter notebooks or head to [localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) for the Lakekeeper UI.

For more information on deployment, please check the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/getting-started/).

# Scope and Features

The Iceberg Catalog REST interface has become the standard for catalogs in open Lakehouses. It natively enables multi-table commits, server-side deconflicting and much more. It is figuratively the (**TIP**) of the Iceberg.

- **Written in Rust**: Single all-in-one binary - no JVM or Python env required.
- **Storage Access Management**: Lakekeeper secures access to your data using Vended-Credentials and remote signing for S3. All major Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) as well as on-premise deployments with S3 are supported.
- **Openid Provider Integration**: Use your own identity provider for authentication, just set `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` and you are good to go.
- **Native Kubernetes Integration**: Use our helm chart to easily deploy high available setups and natively authenticate kubernetes service accounts with Lakekeeper. Kubernetes and OpenID authentication can be used simultaneously. A [Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper-operator) is currently in development.
- **Change Events**: Built-in support to emit change events (CloudEvents), which enables you to react to any change that happen to your tables.
- **Change Approval**: Changes can also be prohibited by external systems. This can be used to prohibit changes to tables that would invalidate Data Contracts, Quality SLOs etc. Simply integrate with your own change approval via our `ContractVerification` trait.
- **Multi-Tenant capable**: A single deployment of Lakekeeper can serve multiple projects - all with a single entrypoint. Each project itself supports multiple Warehouses to which compute engines can connect.
- **Customizable**: Lakekeeper is meant to be extended. We expose the Database implementation (`Catalog`), `SecretsStore`, `Authorizer`, Events (`CloudEventBackend`) and `ContractVerification` as interfaces (Traits). This allows you to tap into any access management system of your company or stream change events to any system you like - simply by implementing a handful methods.
- **Well-Tested**: Integration-tested with `spark`, `pyiceberg`, `trino` and `starrocks`.
- **High Available &amp; Horizontally Scalable**: There is no local state - the catalog can be scaled horizontally easily.
- **Fine Grained Access (FGA):** Lakekeeper&#039;s default Authorization system leverages [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/). If your company already has a different system in place, you can integrate with it by implementing a handful of methods in the `Authorizer` trait.

If you are missing something, we would love to hear about it in a [Github Issue](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/issues/new).
