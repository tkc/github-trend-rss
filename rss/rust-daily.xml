# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running a local development environment

Neon can be run on a workstation for small experiments and to test code changes, by
following these instructions.

#### Installing dependencies on Linux
1. Install build dependencies and other applicable packages

* On Ubuntu or Debian, this set of packages should be sufficient to build the code:
```bash
apt install build-essential libtool libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libseccomp-dev \
libssl-dev clang pkg-config libpq-dev cmake postgresql-client protobuf-compiler \
libprotobuf-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl python3-poetry lsof libicu-dev
```
* On Fedora, these packages are needed:
```bash
dnf install flex bison readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel \
  libseccomp-devel perl clang cmake postgresql postgresql-contrib protobuf-compiler \
  protobuf-devel libcurl-devel openssl poetry lsof libicu-devel libpq-devel python3-devel \
  libffi-devel
```
* On Arch based systems, these packages are needed:
```bash
pacman -S base-devel readline zlib libseccomp openssl clang \
postgresql-libs cmake postgresql protobuf curl lsof
```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo &#039;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it&#039;s built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project&#039;s directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry&gt;=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data
# Later that would be responsibility of a package install script
&gt; cargo neon init
Initializing pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;

# start pageserver, safekeeper, and broker for their intercommunication
&gt; cargo neon start
Starting neon broker at 127.0.0.1:50051.
storage_broker started, pid: 2918372
Starting pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;.
pageserver started, pid: 2918386
Starting safekeeper at &#039;127.0.0.1:5454&#039; in &#039;.neon/safekeepers/sk1&#039;.
safekeeper 1 started, pid: 2918437

# create initial tenant and use it as a default for every future neon_local invocation
&gt; cargo neon tenant create --set-default
tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c successfully created on the pageserver
Created an initial timeline &#039;de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9&#039; at Lsn 0/16B5A50 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c
Setting tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c as a default one

# create postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create main

# start postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start main
Starting new endpoint main (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres&#039;

# check list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT  ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME  LSN        STATUS
 main      127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main         0/16B5BA8  running
```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
&gt; cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline &#039;b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601&#039; at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: &#039;main&#039;

# check branches tree
&gt; cargo neon timeline list
(L) main [de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9]
(L) ┗━ @0/16F9A00: migration_check [b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601]

# create postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create migration_check --branch-name migration_check

# start postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start migration_check
Starting new endpoint migration_check (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55434/postgres&#039;

# check the new list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT         ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME      LSN        STATUS
 main             127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main             0/16F9A38  running
 migration_check  127.0.0.1:55434  b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601  migration_check  0/16F9A70  running

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from &#039;main&#039; postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
&gt; psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn&#039;t affect the &#039;main&#039; postgres
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
&gt; cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Local Development Control Plane (`neon_local`))](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it&#039;s best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--features=testing&quot; make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=17 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

&gt;[!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
&gt; It&#039;s a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
&gt; See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon&#039;s very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it&#039;s inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))

## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,
this repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,
the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the
fellowship, this separation, the RFC process
[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,
namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history
[here](https://polkadot-public.notion.site/Polkadot-SDK-FAQ-fbc4cecc2c46443fb37b9eeec2f0d85f).

## What&#039;s NativeLink?

NativeLink is an efficient, high-performance build cache and remote execution system that accelerates software compilation and testing while reducing infrastructure costs. It optimizes build processes for projects of all sizes by intelligently caching build artifacts and distributing tasks across multiple machines.

NativeLink is trusted in production environments to reduce costs and developer iteration times--handling over **one billion requests** per month for its customers, including large corporations such as **Samsung**.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

      &lt;img src=&quot;https://trace-github-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/harper-90-thumbnail.webp&quot; alt=&quot;NativeLink Explained in 90 seconds&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## 🔑 Key Features

1. **Advanced Build Cache**:
   - Stores and reuses results of previous build steps for unchanged components
   - Significantly reduces build times, especially for incremental changes

2. **Efficient Remote Execution**:
   - Distributes build and test tasks across a network of machines
   - Parallelizes workloads for faster completion
   - Utilizes remote resources to offload computational burden from local machines
   - Ensures consistency with a uniform, controlled build environment

NativeLink seamlessly integrates with build tools that use the Remote Execution protocol, such as [Bazel](https://bazel.build), [Buck2](https://buck2.build), [Goma](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/), and [Reclient](https://github.com/bazelbuild/reclient). It supports Unix-based operating systems and Windows, ensuring broad compatibility across different development environments.

## 🚀 Quickstart

To start, you can deploy NativeLink as a Docker image (as shown below) or by using our cloud-hosted solution, [NativeLink Cloud](https://app.nativelink.com). It&#039;s **FREE** for individuals, open-source projects, and cloud production environments, with support for unlimited team members.

The setups below are **production-grade** installations. See the [contribution docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix/) for instructions on how to build from source with [Bazel](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/bazel/), [Cargo](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/cargo/), and [Nix](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix/).

You can find a few example deployments in the [Docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/deployment-examples/kubernetes).

### 📦 Prebuilt images

Fast to spin up, but currently limited to `x86_64` systems. See the [container
registry](https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/pkgs/container/nativelink)
for all image tags and the [contribution docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix)
for how to build the images yourself.

**Linux x86_64**

```bash
curl -O \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5

# See https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/pkgs/container/nativelink
# to find the latest tag
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/basic_cas.json5:/config \
    -p 50051:50051 \
    ghcr.io/tracemachina/nativelink:v0.6.0 \
    config
```

**Windows x86_64**

```powershell
# Download the configuration file
Invoke-WebRequest `
    -Uri &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5&quot; `
    -OutFile &quot;basic_cas.json5&quot;

# Run the Docker container
# Note: Adjust the path if the script is not run from the directory containing basic_cas.json
docker run `
    -v ${PWD}/basic_cas.json5:/config `
    -p 50051:50051 `
    ghcr.io/tracemachina/nativelink:v0.6.0 `
    config
```

### ❄️ Raw executable with Nix

Slower, since it&#039;s built from source, but more flexible and supports MacOS.
Doesn&#039;t support native Windows, but works in WSL2.

Make sure your Nix version is recent and supports flakes. For instance, install
it via the [next-gen nix installer](https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer).

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Executables built for MacOS are dynamically linked against libraries from Nix
&gt; and won&#039;t work on systems that don&#039;t have these libraries present.

**Linux, MacOS, WSL2**

```bash
curl -O \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5

nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink ./basic_cas.json5
```

See the [contribution docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix) for further information.

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful
as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you
need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience,
consider signing up to our [collaborative online editor][app] for free.

## Example
A [gentle introduction][tutorial] to Typst is available in our documentation.
However, if you want to see the power of Typst encapsulated in one image, here
it is:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 &lt;img alt=&quot;Example&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


Let&#039;s dissect what&#039;s going on:

- We use _set rules_ to configure element properties like the size of pages or
  the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to `auto`, it scales to
  fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you
  need full control, you can also use [show rules][show] to completely redefine
  the appearance of an element.

- We insert a heading with the `= Heading` syntax. One equals sign creates a top
  level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight
  markup like this, see the [syntax] reference for a full list.

- [Mathematical equations][math] are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra
  spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block.
  Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions
  unless put into quotes. This way, we don&#039;t need backslashes for things like
  `floor` and `sqrt`. And `phi.alt` applies the `alt` modifier to the `phi` to
  select a particular symbol variant.

- Now, we get to some [scripting]. To input code into a Typst document, we can
  write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a
  recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the
  results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells
  row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas `$F_1$` to `$F_8$` and then
  the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator (`..`) to both
  because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays&#039; items as individual
  arguments.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Text version of the code example.&lt;/summary&gt;

  ```typst
  #set page(width: 10cm, height: auto)
  #set heading(numbering: &quot;1.&quot;)

  = Fibonacci sequence
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined through the
  recurrence relation $F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)$.
  It can also be expressed in _closed form:_

  $ F_n = round(1 / sqrt(5) phi.alt^n), quad
    phi.alt = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 $

  #let count = 8
  #let nums = range(1, count + 1)
  #let fib(n) = (
    if n &lt;= 2 { 1 }
    else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
  )

  The first #count numbers of the sequence are:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: count,
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; $F_#n$),
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; str(fib(n))),
  ))
  ```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation
Typst&#039;s CLI is available from different sources:

- You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst
  from the [releases page][releases]. Download the archive for your platform and
  place it in a directory that is in your `PATH`. To stay up to date with future
  releases, you can simply run `typst update`.

- You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the
  versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release.
  - Linux:
      - View [Typst on Repology][repology]
      - View [Typst&#039;s Snap][snap]
  - macOS: `brew install typst`
  - Windows: `winget install --id Typst.Typst`

- If you have a [Rust][rust] toolchain installed, you can install
  - the latest released Typst version with
    `cargo install --locked typst-cli`
  - a development version with
    `cargo install --git https://github.com/typst/typst --locked typst-cli`

- Nix users can
  - use the `typst` package with `nix-shell -p typst`
  - build and run a development version with
    `nix run github:typst/typst -- --version`.

- Docker users can run a prebuilt image with
  `docker run ghcr.io/typst/typst:latest --help`.

## Usage
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `file.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile file.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile path/to/source.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch file.typ
```

Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all
of the fonts it discovered:
```sh
# Adds additional directories to search for fonts.
typst compile --font-path path/to/fonts file.typ

# Lists all of the discovered fonts in the system and the given directory.
typst fonts --font-path path/to/fonts

# Or via environment variable (Linux syntax).
TYPST_FONT_PATHS=path/to/fonts typst fonts
```

For other CLI subcommands and options, see below:
```sh
# Prints available subcommands and options.
typst help

# Prints detailed usage of a subcommand.
typst help watch
```

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant
preview, you can also check out [Typst&#039;s free web app][app].

## Community
The main places where the community gathers are our [Forum][forum] and our
[Discord server][discord]. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help
others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more
suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat.
We&#039;d be happy to see you there!

[Typst Universe][universe] is where the community shares templates and packages.
If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our
[package repository][packages].

If you had a bad experience in our community, please [reach out to us][contact].

## Contributing
We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel
free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix,
please follow the steps outlined in the [contribution guide][contributing].

To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the
[latest stable Rust][rust] installed. Then, clone this repository and build the
CLI with the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typst/typst
cd typst
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be stored in `target/release/`.

Another good way to contribute is by [sharing packages][packages] with the
community.

## Pronunciation and Spelling
IPA: /taɪpst/. &quot;Ty&quot; like in **Ty**pesetting and &quot;pst&quot; like in Hi**pst**er. When
writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital &quot;T&quot;.

## Design Principles
All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power,
simplicity, and performance. We think it&#039;s time for a system that matches the
power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize
instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles:

- **Simplicity through Consistency:**
  If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that
  knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing,
  one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g.
  it&#039;s okay that `= Introduction` and `#heading[Introduction]` do the same thing
  because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter.

- **Power through Composability:**
  There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or
  have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the
  second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we&#039;ve
  never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it&#039;s a bit
  low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don&#039;t really
  have that much composability. Instead, there&#039;s a package for everything
  (`\usepackage{knob}`).

- **Performance through Incrementality:**
  All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation.
  Luckily we have [`comemo`], a system for incremental compilation which does
  most of the hard work in the background.

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Platform support

See uv&#039;s [platform support](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/platforms/) document.

## Versioning policy

See uv&#039;s [versioning policy](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/versioning/) document.

## Contributing

[contributing guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

## React Template（⚡️）

⚡️ A minimal React Vite starter template.

### Feature

- ⚡️ Fast - Build tools based on vite.
- 👻 Small - Based on the smallest runnable build.
- 💄 Prettier - Integrated Prettier to help you format the code.

### Docker

```shell
model=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

And then you can make requests like

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/embed \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{&quot;inputs&quot;:&quot;What is Deep Learning?&quot;}&#039; \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039;
```

**Note:** To use GPUs, you need to install
the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).
NVIDIA drivers on your machine need to be compatible with CUDA version 12.2 or higher.

To see all options to serve your models:

```shell
text-embeddings-router --help
```

```
Usage: text-embeddings-router [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --model-id &lt;MODEL_ID&gt;
          The name of the model to load. Can be a MODEL_ID as listed on &lt;https://hf.co/models&gt; like `thenlper/gte-base`.
          Or it can be a local directory containing the necessary files as saved by `save_pretrained(...)` methods of
          transformers

          [env: MODEL_ID=]
          [default: thenlper/gte-base]

      --revision &lt;REVISION&gt;
          The actual revision of the model if you&#039;re referring to a model on the hub. You can use a specific commit id
          or a branch like `refs/pr/2`

          [env: REVISION=]

      --tokenization-workers &lt;TOKENIZATION_WORKERS&gt;
          Optionally control the number of tokenizer workers used for payload tokenization, validation and truncation.
          Default to the number of CPU cores on the machine

          [env: TOKENIZATION_WORKERS=]

      --dtype &lt;DTYPE&gt;
          The dtype to be forced upon the model

          [env: DTYPE=]
          [possible values: float16, float32]

      --pooling &lt;POOLING&gt;
          Optionally control the pooling method for embedding models.

          If `pooling` is not set, the pooling configuration will be parsed from the model `1_Pooling/config.json` configuration.

          If `pooling` is set, it will override the model pooling configuration

          [env: POOLING=]

          Possible values:
          - cls:        Select the CLS token as embedding
          - mean:       Apply Mean pooling to the model embeddings
          - splade:     Apply SPLADE (Sparse Lexical and Expansion) to the model embeddings. This option is only
          available if the loaded model is a `ForMaskedLM` Transformer model
          - last-token: Select the last token as embedding

      --max-concurrent-requests &lt;MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS&gt;
          The maximum amount of concurrent requests for this particular deployment.
          Having a low limit will refuse clients requests instead of having them wait for too long and is usually good
          to handle backpressure correctly

          [env: MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=]
          [default: 512]

      --max-batch-tokens &lt;MAX_BATCH_TOKENS&gt;
          **IMPORTANT** This is one critical control to allow maximum usage of the available hardware.

          This represents the total amount of potential tokens within a batch.

          For `max_batch_tokens=1000`, you could fit `10` queries of `total_tokens=100` or a single query of `1000` tokens.

          Overall this number should be the largest possible until the model is compute bound. Since the actual memory
          overhead depends on the model implementation, text-embeddings-inference cannot infer this number automatically.

          [env: MAX_BATCH_TOKENS=]
          [default: 16384]

      --max-batch-requests &lt;MAX_BATCH_REQUESTS&gt;
          Optionally control the maximum number of individual requests in a batch

          [env: MAX_BATCH_REQUESTS=]

      --max-client-batch-size &lt;MAX_CLIENT_BATCH_SIZE&gt;
          Control the maximum number of inputs that a client can send in a single request

          [env: MAX_CLIENT_BATCH_SIZE=]
          [default: 32]

      --auto-truncate
          Automatically truncate inputs that are longer than the maximum supported size

          Unused for gRPC servers

          [env: AUTO_TRUNCATE=]

      --default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;
          The name of the prompt that should be used by default for encoding. If not set, no prompt will be applied.

          Must be a key in the `sentence-transformers` configuration `prompts` dictionary.

          For example if ``default_prompt_name`` is &quot;query&quot; and the ``prompts`` is {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;query: &quot;, ...}, then the
          sentence &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot; will be encoded as &quot;query: What is the capital of France?&quot; because
          the prompt text will be prepended before any text to encode.

          The argument &#039;--default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;&#039; cannot be used with &#039;--default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;`

          [env: DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME=]

      --default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;
          The prompt that should be used by default for encoding. If not set, no prompt will be applied.

          For example if ``default_prompt`` is &quot;query: &quot; then the sentence &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot; will be
          encoded as &quot;query: What is the capital of France?&quot; because the prompt text will be prepended before any text
          to encode.

          The argument &#039;--default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;&#039; cannot be used with &#039;--default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;`

          [env: DEFAULT_PROMPT=]

      --hf-token &lt;HF_TOKEN&gt;
          Your Hugging Face Hub token

          [env: HF_TOKEN=]

      --hostname &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;
          The IP address to listen on

          [env: HOSTNAME=]
          [default: 0.0.0.0]

      -p, --port &lt;PORT&gt;
          The port to listen on

          [env: PORT=]
          [default: 3000]

      --uds-path &lt;UDS_PATH&gt;
          The name of the unix socket some text-embeddings-inference backends will use as they communicate internally
          with gRPC

          [env: UDS_PATH=]
          [default: /tmp/text-embeddings-inference-server]

      --huggingface-hub-cache &lt;HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE&gt;
          The location of the huggingface hub cache. Used to override the location if you want to provide a mounted disk
          for instance

          [env: HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=]

      --payload-limit &lt;PAYLOAD_LIMIT&gt;
          Payload size limit in bytes

          Default is 2MB

          [env: PAYLOAD_LIMIT=]
          [default: 2000000]

      --api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;
          Set an api key for request authorization.

          By default the server responds to every request. With an api key set, the requests must have the Authorization
          header set with the api key as Bearer token.

          [env: API_KEY=]

      --json-output
          Outputs the logs in JSON format (useful for telemetry)

          [env: JSON_OUTPUT=]

      --disable-spans
          Disables the span logging trace

          [env: DISABLE_SPANS=]

      --otlp-endpoint &lt;OTLP_ENDPOINT&gt;
          The grpc endpoint for opentelemetry. Telemetry is sent to this endpoint as OTLP over gRPC. e.g. `http://localhost:4317`

          [env: OTLP_ENDPOINT=]

      --otlp-service-name &lt;OTLP_SERVICE_NAME&gt;
          The service name for opentelemetry. e.g. `text-embeddings-inference.server`

          [env: OTLP_SERVICE_NAME=]
          [default: text-embeddings-inference.server]

      --prometheus-port &lt;PORT&gt;
          The Prometheus metrics port to listen on

          [env: PROMETHEUS_PORT=]
          [default: 9000]

      --cors-allow-origin &lt;CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN&gt;
          Unused for gRPC servers

          [env: CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=]
```

### Docker Images

Text Embeddings Inference ships with multiple Docker images that you can use to target a specific backend:

| Architecture                        | Image                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU                                 | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:cpu-1.7                   |
| Volta                               | NOT SUPPORTED                                                           |
| Turing (T4, RTX 2000 series, ...)   | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:turing-1.7 (experimental) |
| Ampere 80 (A100, A30)               | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7                       |
| Ampere 86 (A10, A40, ...)           | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:86-1.7                    |
| Ada Lovelace (RTX 4000 series, ...) | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:89-1.7                    |
| Hopper (H100)                       | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:hopper-1.7 (experimental) |

**Warning**: Flash Attention is turned off by default for the Turing image as it suffers from precision issues.
You can turn Flash Attention v1 ON by using the `USE_FLASH_ATTENTION=True` environment variable.

### API documentation

You can consult the OpenAPI documentation of the `text-embeddings-inference` REST API using the `/docs` route.
The Swagger UI is also available
at: [https://huggingface.github.io/text-embeddings-inference](https://huggingface.github.io/text-embeddings-inference).

### Using a private or gated model

You have the option to utilize the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable for configuring the token employed by
`text-embeddings-inference`. This allows you to gain access to protected resources.

For example:

1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Copy your cli READ token
3. Export `HF_TOKEN=&lt;your cli READ token&gt;`

or with Docker:

```shell
model=&lt;your private model&gt;
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run
token=&lt;your cli READ token&gt;

docker run --gpus all -e HF_TOKEN=$token -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

### Air gapped deployment

To deploy Text Embeddings Inference in an air-gapped environment, first download the weights and then mount them inside
the container using a volume.

For example:

```shell
# (Optional) create a `models` directory
mkdir models
cd models

# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-base-en-v1.5

# Set the models directory as the volume path
volume=$PWD

# Mount the models directory inside the container with a volume and set the model ID
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id /data/gte-base-en-v1.5
```

### Using Re-rankers models

`text-embeddings-inference` v0.4.0 added support for CamemBERT, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, and GTE Sequence Classification models.
Re-rankers models are Sequence Classification cross-encoders models with a single class that scores the similarity
between a query and a text.

See [this blogpost](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/boosting-rag-picking-the-best-embedding-reranker-models-42d079022e83) by
the LlamaIndex team to understand how you can use re-rankers models in your RAG pipeline to improve
downstream performance.

```shell
model=BAAI/bge-reranker-large
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

And then you can rank the similarity between a query and a list of texts with:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/rerank \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;What is Deep Learning?&quot;, &quot;texts&quot;: [&quot;Deep Learning is not...&quot;, &quot;Deep learning is...&quot;]}&#039; \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039;
```

### Using Sequence Classification models

You can also use classic Sequence Classification models like `SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions`:

```shell
model=SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

Once you have deployed the model you can use the `predict` endpoint to get the emotions most associated with an input:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/predict \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{&quot;inputs&quot;:&quot;I like you.&quot;}&#039; \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039;
```

### Using SPLADE pooling

You can choose to activate SPLADE pooling for Bert and Distilbert MaskedLM architectures:

```shell
model=naver/efficient-splade-VI-BT-large-query
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model --pooling splade
```

Once you have deployed the model you can use the `/embed_sparse` endpoint to get the sparse embedding:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/embed_sparse \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{&quot;inputs&quot;:&quot;I like you.&quot;}&#039; \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039;
```

### Distributed Tracing

`text-embeddings-inference` is instrumented with distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry. You can use this feature
by setting the address t

[English] | [简体中文]


Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

## Community

### Forum

Atuin has a community forum, please ask here for help and support: https://forum.atuin.sh/

### Discord

Atuin also has a community Discord, available [here](https://discord.gg/jR3tfchVvW)

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

# Security

If you find any security issues, we&#039;d appreciate it if you could alert ellie@atuin.sh

DataFusion is an extensible query engine written in [Rust] that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate provides libraries and binaries for developers building fast and
feature rich database and analytic systems, customized to particular workloads.
See [use cases] for examples. The following related subprojects target end users:

- [DataFusion Python](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/) offers a Python interface for SQL and DataFrame
  queries.
- [DataFusion Ray](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ray/) provides a distributed version of DataFusion that scales
  out on Ray clusters.
- [DataFusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/) is an accelerator for Apache Spark based on
  DataFusion.

&quot;Out of the box,&quot;
DataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs, excellent [performance],
built-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro, extensive customization, and
a great community.

DataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,
vectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can
customize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,
query languages, functions, custom operators and more.
See the [Architecture] section for more details.

## Crate features

This crate has several [features] which can be specified in your `Cargo.toml`.

[features]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html

Default features:

- `nested_expressions`: functions for working with nested type function such as `array_to_string`
- `compression`: reading files compressed with `xz2`, `bzip2`, `flate2`, and `zstd`
- `crypto_expressions`: cryptographic functions such as `md5` and `sha256`
- `datetime_expressions`: date and time functions such as `to_timestamp`
- `encoding_expressions`: `encode` and `decode` functions
- `parquet`: support for reading the [Apache Parquet] format
- `regex_expressions`: regular expression functions, such as `regexp_match`
- `unicode_expressions`: Include unicode aware functions such as `character_length`
- `unparser`: enables support to reverse LogicalPlans back into SQL
- `recursive_protection`: uses [recursive](https://docs.rs/recursive/latest/recursive/) for stack overflow protection.

Optional features:

- `avro`: support for reading the [Apache Avro] format
- `backtrace`: include backtrace information in error messages
- `pyarrow`: conversions between PyArrow and DataFusion types
- `serde`: enable arrow-schema&#039;s `serde` feature

[apache parquet]: https://parquet.apache.org/

## Rust Version Compatibility Policy

The Rust toolchain releases are tracked at [Rust Versions](https://releases.rs) and follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A Rust toolchain release can be identified
by a version string like `1.80.0`, or more generally `major.minor.patch`.

DataFusion&#039;s supports the last 4 stable Rust minor versions released and any such versions released within the last 4 months.

For example, given the releases `1.78.0`, `1.79.0`, `1.80.0`, `1.80.1` and `1.81.0` DataFusion will support 1.78.0, which is 3 minor versions prior to the most minor recent `1.81`.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

DataFusion enforces MSRV policy using a [MSRV CI Check](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fdatafusion+rust-version+language%3ATOML+path%3A%2F%5ECargo.toml%2F&amp;type=code)

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html

Build and publish crates with [pyo3, cffi and uniffi bindings](https://maturin.rs/bindings) as well as rust binaries as python packages with minimal configuration.
It supports building wheels for python 3.8+ on Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD, can upload them to [pypi](https://pypi.org/) and has basic PyPy and GraalPy support.

Check out the [User Guide](https://maturin.rs/)!

## Usage

You can either download binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/releases/latest) or install it with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```shell
pipx install maturin
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; `pip install maturin` should also work if you don&#039;t want to use pipx.

There are four main commands:

- `maturin new` creates a new cargo project with maturin configured.
- `maturin publish` builds the crate into python packages and publishes them to pypi.
- `maturin build` builds the wheels and stores them in a folder (`target/wheels` by default), but doesn&#039;t upload them. It&#039;s possible to upload those with [twine](https://github.com/pypa/twine) or `maturin upload`.
- `maturin develop` builds the crate and installs it as a python module directly in the current virtualenv. Note that while `maturin develop` is faster, it doesn&#039;t support all the feature that running `pip install` after `maturin build` supports.

maturin doesn&#039;t need extra configuration files and doesn&#039;t clash with an existing setuptools-rust or milksnake configuration.
You can even integrate it with testing tools such as [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
There are examples for the different bindings in the `test-crates` folder.

The name of the package will be the name of the cargo project, i.e. the name field in the `[package]` section of `Cargo.toml`.
The name of the module, which you are using when importing, will be the `name` value in the `[lib]` section (which defaults to the name of the package). For binaries, it&#039;s simply the name of the binary generated by cargo.

When using `maturin build` and `maturin develop` commands, you can compile a performance-optimized program by adding the `-r` or `--release` flag.

## Python packaging basics

Python packages come in two formats:
A built form called wheel and source distributions (sdist), both of which are archives.
A wheel can be compatible with any python version, interpreter (cpython and pypy, mainly), operating system and hardware architecture (for pure python wheels),
can be limited to a specific platform and architecture (e.g. when using ctypes or cffi) or to a specific python interpreter and version on a specific architecture and operating system (e.g. with pyo3).

When using `pip install` on a package, pip tries to find a matching wheel and install that. If it doesn&#039;t find one, it downloads the source distribution and builds a wheel for the current platform,
which requires the right compilers to be installed. Installing a wheel is much faster than installing a source distribution as building wheels is generally slow.

When you publish a package to be installable with `pip install`, you upload it to [pypi](https://pypi.org/), the official package repository.
For testing, you can use [test pypi](https://test.pypi.org/) instead, which you can use with `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/`.
Note that for publishing for linux, [you need to use the manylinux docker container](#manylinux-and-auditwheel), while for publishing from your repository you can use the [PyO3/maturin-action github action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action).

## Mixed rust/python projects

To create a mixed rust/python project, create a folder with your module name (i.e. `lib.name` in Cargo.toml) next to your Cargo.toml and add your python sources there:

```
my-project
├── Cargo.toml
├── my_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── bar.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

You can specify a different python source directory in `pyproject.toml` by setting `tool.maturin.python-source`, for example

**pyproject.toml**

```toml
[tool.maturin]
python-source = &quot;python&quot;
module-name = &quot;my_project._lib_name&quot;
```

then the project structure would look like this:

```
my-project
├── Cargo.toml
├── python
│   └── my_project
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── bar.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; This structure is recommended to avoid [a common `ImportError` pitfall](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/issues/490)

maturin will add the native extension as a module in your python folder. When using develop, maturin will copy the native library and for cffi also the glue code to your python folder. You should add those files to your gitignore.

With cffi you can do `from .my_project import lib` and then use `lib.my_native_function`, with pyo3 you can directly `from .my_project import my_native_function`.

Example layout with pyo3 after `maturin develop`:

```
my-project
├── Cargo.toml
├── my_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── bar.py
│   └── _lib_name.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
├── README.md
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

When doing this also be sure to set the module name in your code to match the last part of `module-name` (don&#039;t include the package path):

```rust
#[pymodule]
#[pyo3(name=&quot;_lib_name&quot;)]
fn my_lib_name(_py: Python&lt;&#039;_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_class::&lt;MyPythonRustClass&gt;()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Python metadata

maturin supports [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/), you can specify python package metadata in `pyproject.toml`.
maturin merges metadata from `Cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml`, `pyproject.toml` takes precedence over `Cargo.toml`.

To specify python dependencies, add a list `dependencies` in a `[project]` section in the `pyproject.toml`. This list is equivalent to `install_requires` in setuptools:

```toml
[project]
name = &quot;my-project&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;flask~=1.1.0&quot;, &quot;toml==0.10.0&quot;]
```

Pip allows adding so called console scripts, which are shell commands that execute some function in your program. You can add console scripts in a section `[project.scripts]`.
The keys are the script names while the values are the path to the function in the format `some.module.path:class.function`, where the `class` part is optional. The function is called with no arguments. Example:

```toml
[project.scripts]
get_42 = &quot;my_project:DummyClass.get_42&quot;
```

You can also specify [trove classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) in your `pyproject.toml` under `project.classifiers`:

```toml
[project]
name = &quot;my-project&quot;
classifiers = [&quot;Programming Language :: Python&quot;]
```

## Source distribution

maturin supports building through `pyproject.toml`. To use it, create a `pyproject.toml` next to your `Cargo.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = [&quot;maturin&gt;=1.0,&lt;2.0&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;maturin&quot;
```

If a `pyproject.toml` with a `[build-system]` entry is present, maturin can build a source distribution of your package when `--sdist` is specified.
The source distribution will contain the same files as `cargo package`. To only build a source distribution, pass `--interpreter` without any values.

You can then e.g. install your package with `pip install .`. With `pip install . -v` you can see the output of cargo and maturin.

You can use the options `compatibility`, `skip-auditwheel`, `bindings`, `strip` and common Cargo build options such as `features` under `[tool.maturin]` the same way you would when running maturin directly.
The `bindings` key is required for cffi and bin projects as those can&#039;t be automatically detected. Currently, all builds are in release mode (see [this thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-517-debug-vs-release-builds/1924) for details).

For a non-manylinux build with cffi bindings you could use the following:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = [&quot;maturin&gt;=1.0,&lt;2.0&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;maturin&quot;

[tool.maturin]
bindings = &quot;cffi&quot;
compatibility = &quot;linux&quot;
```

`manylinux` option is also accepted as an alias of `compatibility` for backward compatibility with old version of maturin.

To include arbitrary files in the sdist for use during compilation specify `include` as an array of `path` globs with `format` set to `sdist`:

```toml
[tool.maturin]
include = [{ path = &quot;path/**/*&quot;, format = &quot;sdist&quot; }]
```

There&#039;s a `maturin sdist` command for only building a source distribution as workaround for [pypa/pip#6041](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6041).

## Manylinux and auditwheel

For portability reasons, native python modules on linux must only dynamically link a set of very few libraries which are installed basically everywhere, hence the name manylinux.
The pypa offers special docker images and a tool called [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/) to ensure compliance with the [manylinux rules](https://peps.python.org/pep-0599/#the-manylinux2014-policy).
If you want to publish widely usable wheels for linux pypi, **you need to use a manylinux docker image or build with zig**.

The Rust compiler since version 1.64 [requires at least glibc 2.17](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/08/01/Increasing-glibc-kernel-requirements.html), so you need to use at least manylinux2014.
For publishing, we recommend enforcing the same manylinux version as the image with the manylinux flag, e.g. use `--manylinux 2014` if you are building in `quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64`.
The [PyO3/maturin-action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action) github action already takes care of this if you set e.g. `manylinux: 2014`.

maturin contains a reimplementation of auditwheel automatically checks the generated library and gives the wheel the proper platform tag.
If your system&#039;s glibc is too new or you link other shared libraries, it will assign the `linux` tag.
You can also manually disable those checks and directly use native linux target with `--manylinux off`.

For full manylinux compliance you need to compile in a CentOS docker container. The [pyo3/maturin](https://ghcr.io/pyo3/maturin) image is based on the manylinux2014 image,
and passes arguments to the `maturin` binary. You can use it like this:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/io ghcr.io/pyo3/maturin build --release  # or other maturin arguments
```

Note that this image is very basic and only contains python, maturin and stable rust. If you need additional tools, you can run commands inside the manylinux container.
See [konstin/complex-manylinux-maturin-docker](https://github.com/konstin/complex-manylinux-maturin-docker) for a small educational example or [nanoporetech/fast-ctc-decode](https://github.com/nanoporetech/fast-ctc-decode/blob/b226ea0f2b2f4f474eff47349703d57d2ea4801b/.github/workflows/publish.yml) for a real world setup.

maturin itself is manylinux compliant when compiled for the musl target.

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you are running these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, otherwise the application might not be able to find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

`gitoxide` is an implementation of `git` written in Rust for developing future-proof applications which strive for correctness and
performance while providing a pleasant and unsurprising developer experience.

`gitoxide` provides the `gix` and `ein` binaries for use on the command-line to allow experimentation with key features
like `fetch` and `clone`, and to validate the usability and control of the API offered by the [`gix`] crate.

`gitoxide` aspires to be a production-grade server implementation and the `ein` binary aspires to become the default way to interact with git repositories.

## Development Status

The command-line tools as well as the status of each crate is described in
[the crate status document](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md).

For use in applications, look for the [`gix`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md#gix) crate,
which serves as entrypoint to the functionality provided by various lower-level plumbing crates like
[`gix-config`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md#gix-config).

### Feature Discovery

&gt; Can `gix` do what I need it to do?

The above can be hard to answer and this paragraph is here to help with feature discovery.

Look at [`crate-status.md`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md) for a rather exhaustive document that contains
both implemented and planned features.

Further, the [`gix` crate documentation with the `git2` search term](https://docs.rs/gix/latest/gix?search=git2) helps to find all currently
known `git2` equivalent method calls. Please note that this list is definitely not exhaustive yet, but might help if you are coming from `git2`.

What follows is a high-level list of features and those which are planned:

* [x] clone
* [x] fetch
* [ ] blame
* [ ] push
* [ ] reset
* [ ] status
* [x] blob-diff
* [ ] merge
    - [x] blobs
    - [x] trees
    - [ ] commits
* [ ] rebase
* [ ] commit
* [x] worktree checkout and worktree stream
* [x] reading and writing of objects
* [x] reading and writing of refs
* [x] reading and writing of `.git/index`
* [x] reading and writing of git configuration
* [x] pathspecs
* [x] revspecs
* [x] `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`

### Crates

Follow linked crate name for detailed status. Please note that all crates follow [semver] as well as the [stability guide].

[semver]: https://semver.org

### Production Grade

* **Stability Tier 1**
  - [gix-lock](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/gix-lock/README.md)

* **Stability Tier 2**
  - [gix-tempfile](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/gix-tempfile/README.md)

### Stabilization Candidates

Crates that seem feature complete and need to see some more use before they can be released as 1.0.
Documentation is complete and was reviewed at least once.

### From Source via Cargo

`cargo` is the Rust package manager which can easily be obtained through [rustup]. With it, you can build your own binary
effortlessly and for your particular CPU for additional performance gains.

The minimum supported Rust version is [documented in the CI configuration](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/.github/workflows/msrv.yml#L23),
the latest stable one will work as well.

There are various build configurations, all of them are [documented here](https://docs.rs/crate/gitoxide/latest). The documentation should also be useful
for packagers who need to tune external dependencies.

```
# A way to install `gitoxide` with just Rust and a C compiler installed.
# If there are problems with SSL certificates during clones, try to omit `--locked`.
cargo install gitoxide --locked --no-default-features --features max-pure

# The default installation, &#039;max&#039;, is the fastest, but also needs `cmake` to build successfully.
# Installing it is platform-dependent.
cargo install gitoxide

# For smaller binaries and even faster build times that are traded for a less fancy CLI implementation,
# use the `lean` feature.
cargo install gitoxide --locked --no-default-features --features lean
```

The following installs the latest unpublished `max` release directly from git:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide  gitoxide
```

#### How to deal with build failures

On some platforms, installation may fail due to lack of tools required by `C` toolchains. This can generally be avoided by installation
with `cargo install gitoxide --no-default-features --features max-pure`.

What follows is a list of known failures.

- On Fedora, `perl` needs to be installed for `OpenSSL` to build properly. This can be done with the following command:
  `dnf install perl` (see [this issue](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/issues/592)).
-
### Using Docker

Some CI/CD pipelines leverage repository cloning. Below is a copy-paste-able example to build docker images for such workflows.
As no official image exists (at this time), an image must first be built.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The dockerfile isn&#039;t continuously tested as it costs too much time and thus might already be broken.
&gt; PRs are welcome.

#### Building the most compatible base image

```sh
docker build -f etc/docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t gitoxide:latest --compress . --target=pipeline
```

#### Basic usage in a Pipeline

For example, if a `Dockerfile` currently uses something like `RUN git clone https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide`, first build the image:

```sh
docker build -f etc/docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t gitoxide:latest --compress .
```

Then copy the binaries into your image and replace the `git` directive with a `gix` equivalent.

```dockerfile
COPY --from gitoxide:latest /bin/gix /usr/local/bin/
COPY --from gitoxide:latest /bin/ein /usr/local/bin/

RUN /usr/local/bin/gix clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide gitoxide
```

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs

## Usage

Once installed, there are two binaries:

* **ein**
  * high level commands, _porcelain_, for every-day use, optimized for a pleasant user experience
* **gix**
  * low level commands, _plumbing_, for use in more specialized cases and to validate newly written code in real-world scenarios

## Project Goals

Project goals can change over time as we learn more, and they can be challenged.

 * **a pure-rust implementation of git**
   * including *transport*, *object database*, *references*, *cli* and *tui*
   * a simple command-line interface is provided for the most common git operations, optimized for
     user experience. A *simple-git* if you so will.
   * be the go-to implementation for anyone who wants to solve problems around git, and become
     *the* alternative to `GitPython` and *libgit2* in the process.
   * become the foundation for a distributed alternative to GitHub, and maybe even for use within GitHub itself
 * **learn from the best to write the best possible idiomatic Rust**
   * *libgit2* is a fantastic resource to see what abstractions work, we will use them
   * use Rust&#039;s type system to make misuse impossible
 * **be the best performing implementation**
   * use Rust&#039;s type system to optimize for work not done without being hard to use
   * make use of parallelism from the get go
   * _sparse checkout_ support from day one
 * **assure on-disk consistency**
   * assure reads never interfere with concurrent writes
   * assure multiple concurrent writes don&#039;t cause trouble
 * **take shortcuts, but not in quality**
   * binaries may use `anyhow::Error` exhaustively, knowing these errors are solely user-facing.
   * libraries use light-weight custom errors implemented using `quick-error` or `thiserror`.
   * internationalization is nothing we are concerned with right now.
   * IO errors due to insufficient amount of open file handles don&#039;t always lead to operation failure
 * **Cross platform support, including Windows**
   * With the tools and experience available here there is no reason not to support Windows.
   * [Windows is tested on CI](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/df66d74aa2a8cb62d8a03383135f08c8e8c579a8/.github/workflows/rust.yml#L34)
     and failures do prevent releases.

## Non-Goals

Project non-goals can change over time as we learn more, and they can be challenged.

 * **replicate `git` command functionality perfectly**
   * `git` is `git`, and there is no reason to not use it. Our path is the one of simplicity to make
     getting started with git easy.
 * **be incompatible to git**
   * the on-disk format must remain compatible, and we will never contend with it.
 * **use async IO everywhere**
   * for the most part, git operations are heavily reliant on memory mapped IO as well as CPU to decompress data,
     which doesn&#039;t lend itself well to async IO out of the box.
   * Use `blocking` as well as `gix-features::interrupt` to bring operations into the async world and to control
     long running operations.
   * When connecting or streaming over TCP connections, especially when receiving on the server, async seems like a must
     though, but behind a feature flag.

## Roadmap

### Features for 1.0

Provide a CLI to for the most basic user journey:

* [x] initialize a repository
* [x] fetch
    * [ ] and update worktree
* clone a repository
   - [ ] bare
   - [ ] with working tree
* [ ] create a commit after adding worktree files
* [x] add a remote
* [ ] push
  * [x] create (thin) pack

### Ideas for Examples

* [ ] `gix tool open-remote` open the URL of the remote, possibly after applying known transformations to go from `ssh` to `https`.
* [ ] `tix` as example implementation of `tig`, displaying a version of the commit graph, useful for practicing how highly responsive GUIs can be made.
* [ ] Something like [`git-sizer`](https://github.com/github/git-sizer), but leveraging extreme decompression speeds of indexed packs.
* [ ] Open up SQL for git using [sqlite virtual tables](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/blob/master/tests/vtab.rs). Check out gitqlite
  as well. What would an MVP look like? Maybe even something that could ship with gitoxide. See [this go implementation as example](https://github.com/filhodanuvem/gitql).
* [ ] A tru

## ⚓ Oxc

The Oxidation Compiler is creating a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Oxc is building a parser, linter, formatter, transformer, minifier, resolver ... all written in Rust.

See more at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs)!

## VoidZero Inc.

Oxc is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/blog).

If you have requirements for JavaScript tools at scale, please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/WQgjyzYJpwurpxWKA)!

## 🙋Who&#039;s using Oxc?

- [Rolldown] uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing and transformation.
- [Nova engine](https://trynova.dev) uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing.
- [Rolldown][rolldown], [Biome][biome] and [swc-node](https://github.com/swc-project/swc-node) uses the [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] crate for module resolution.
- Projects and companies like [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/4c20c23c16dd60f380ce9fe98afc93041a7e1562/oxlint.json), [Shopify](https://oxc.rs/blog/2023-12-12-announcing-oxlint.html#_50-100-times-faster-than-eslint), ByteDance and Shopee uses oxlint for linting.
- ...[and many more](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/projects.html)

## ⚡️ Linter Quick Start

The linter is ready to catch mistakes for you. It comes with 93 rules turned on by default (out of 430+ in total) and no configuration is required.

To get started, run [oxlint][npm-oxlint] or via `npx`:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds.

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## ⚡️ Performance

- The parser aims to be the fastest Rust-based ready-for-production parser.
- The linter is more than 50 times faster than [ESLint], and scales with the number of CPU cores.

&lt;/p&gt;

## ⌨️ Rust, Node.js and Wasm Usage

### Rust

Individual crates are published, you may use them to build your own JavaScript tools.

- The umbrella crate [oxc][docs-oxc-url] exports all public crates from this repository.
- The AST and parser crates [oxc_ast][docs-ast-url] and [oxc_parser][docs-parser-url] are production ready.
- The resolver crate [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] for module resolution is also production ready.
- Example usages of these crates can be found in their respective `crates/*/examples` directory.

While Rust has gained a reputation for its comparatively slower compilation speed,
we have dedicated significant effort to fine-tune the Rust compilation speed.
Our aim is to minimize any impact on your development workflow,
ensuring that developing your own Oxc based tools remains a smooth and efficient experience.

This is demonstrated by our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain),
where warm runs complete in 3 minutes.

### Node.js

- via napi: [oxc-parser][npm-napi-parser], [oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform]

### Wasm

- [@oxc-parser/wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-parser/wasm)

---

## 🎯 Tools

- [AST and Parser](#-ast-and-parser)
- [Linter](#-linter)
- [Resolver](#-resolver)
- [Minifier](#-minifier)
- [Formatter](#-formatter)
- [Transformer](#-transformer)

### 🔸 AST and Parser

Oxc maintains its own AST and parser, which is by far the fastest and most conformant JavaScript and TypeScript (including JSX and TSX) parser written in Rust.

As the parser often represents a key performance bottleneck in JavaScript tooling,
any minor improvements can have a cascading effect on our downstream tools.
By developing our parser, we have the opportunity to explore and implement well-researched performance techniques.

While many existing JavaScript tools rely on [estree] as their AST specification,
a notable drawback is its abundance of ambiguous nodes.
This ambiguity often leads to confusion during development with [estree].

The Oxc AST differs slightly from the [estree] AST by removing ambiguous nodes and introducing distinct types.
For example, instead of using a generic [estree] `Identifier`,
the Oxc AST provides specific types such as `BindingIdentifier`, `IdentifierReference`, and `IdentifierName`.
This clear distinction greatly enhances the development experience by aligning more closely with the ECMAScript specification.

#### 🏆 Parser Performance

Our [benchmark][parser-benchmark] reveals that the Oxc parser surpasses the speed of the [swc] parser by approximately 3 times and the [Biome][biome] parser by 5 times.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST is allocated in a memory arena (&lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/bumpalo&quot;&gt;bumpalo&lt;/a&gt;) for fast AST memory allocation and deallocation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Short strings are inlined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/compact_str&quot;&gt;CompactString&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No other heap allocations are done except the above two.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Scope binding, symbol resolution and some syntax errors are not done in the parser, they are delegated to the semantic analyzer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### 🔸 Linter

The linter embraces convention over configuration, eliminating the need for extensive configuration and plugin setup.
Unlike other linters like [ESLint], which often require intricate configurations and plugin installations (e.g. [@typescript-eslint]),
our linter only requires a single command that you can immediately run on your codebase:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

#### 🏆 Linter Performance

The linter is 50 - 100 times faster than [ESLint] depending on the number of rules and number of CPU cores used.
It completes in less than a second for most codebases with a few hundred files and completes in a few seconds for
larger monorepos. See [bench-javascript-linter](https://github.com/Boshen/bench-javascript-linter) for details.

As an upside, the binary is approximately 5MB, whereas [ESLint] and its associated plugin dependencies can easily exceed 100.

You may also download the linter binary from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest) as a standalone binary,
this lets you run the linter without a Node.js installation in your CI.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Oxc parser is used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST visit is a fast operation due to linear memory scan from the memory arena.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Files are linted in a multi-threaded environment, so scales with the total number of CPU cores.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Every single lint rule is tuned for performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### 🔸 Resolver

Module resolution plays a crucial role in JavaScript tooling, especially for tasks like multi-file analysis or bundling. However, it can often become a performance bottleneck.
To address this, we developed [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url].

The resolver is production-ready and is currently being used in [Rolldown][rolldown]. Usage and examples can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc_resolver).

### 🔸 Transformer

A transformer is responsible for turning higher versions of ECMAScript to a lower version that can be used in older browsers.

TypeScript and React transforms are complete. See [Milestone 2](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/2859) for current goals.

[oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform] can be used for experimentation.

### 🔸 Isolated Declarations

[TypeScript Isolated Declarations Emit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/#isolated-declarations) without using the TypeScript compiler.

Our [benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-transformer) indications that our implementation is at least 20 times faster than the TypeScript compiler.

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) or [crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_isolated_declarations) can be used for this task.

### 🔸 Minifier

JavaScript minification plays a crucial role in optimizing website performance as it reduces the amount of data sent to users,
resulting in faster page loads.
This holds tremendous economic value, particularly for e-commerce websites, where every second can equate to millions of dollars.

However, existing minifiers typically require a trade-off between compression quality and speed.
You have to choose between the slowest for the best compression or the fastest for less compression.
But what if we could develop a faster minifier without compromising on compression?

We are actively working on a prototype that aims to achieve this goal,
by porting all test cases from well-known minifiers such as [google-closure-compiler], [terser], [esbuild], and [tdewolff-minify].

Preliminary results indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives.
With the Oxc minifier, you can expect faster minification times without sacrificing compression quality.

### 🔸 Formatter

While [prettier] has established itself as the de facto code formatter for JavaScript, there is a significant demand in the developer community for a less opinionated alternative. Recognizing this need, our ambition is to undertake research and development to create a new JavaScript formatter that offers increased flexibility and customization options.

The [prototype](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_formatter) is currently work in progress.

## 🧪Test Infrastructure

In Oxc, correctness and reliability are taken extremely seriously.

We spend half of our time on strengthening the test infrastructure to prevent problems from propagating to downstream tools.

[Test Infrastructure](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/architecture/test.html) documents our test procedures:

- Conformance suite on Test262, Babel, TypeScript
- Lots of fuzzing
- Linter snapshot diagnostics
- oxlint ecosystem ci
- Idempotency testing
- Code coverage
- End to end 3000 top npm packages

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any
questions, or want to talk about future plans, please join us on Discord

start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) C library and the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [&quot;co-located&quot; local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary&#039;s name may change (i.e.
away from `jj`). For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 30TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 100 contributors** and growing.

## Comparisons

### Performance

The following performance tests demonstrate baseline performance between
common protocols with the exception of the Regex Parsing test.

# Pixi: Package Management Made Easy

## Overview

`pixi` is a cross-platform, multi-language package manager and workflow tool built on the foundation of the conda ecosystem. It provides developers with an exceptional experience similar to popular package managers like `cargo` or `yarn`, but for any language.

Developed with ❤️ at [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).
[![Real-time pixi_demo](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/assets/12893423/0fc8f8c8-ac13-4c14-891b-dc613f25475b)](https://asciinema.org/a/636482)

## Highlights

- Supports **multiple languages** including Python, C++, and R using Conda packages. You can find available packages on [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).
- Compatible with all major operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS (including Apple Silicon).
- Always includes an up-to-date **lock file**.
- Provides a clean and simple Cargo-like **command-line interface**.
- Allows you to install tools **per-project** or **system-wide**.
- Entirely written in **Rust** and built on top of the **[rattler](https://github.com/conda/rattler)** library.

## Getting Started

- ⚡ [Installation](#installation)
- ⚙️ [Examples](/examples)
- 📚 [Documentation](https://pixi.sh/)
- 😍 [Contributing](#contributing)
- 🔨 [Built using Pixi](#built-using-pixi)
- 🚀 [GitHub Action](https://github.com/prefix-dev/setup-pixi)

## Status

Pixi is ready for production!
We are working hard to keep file-format changes compatible with the previous
versions so that you can rely on Pixi with peace of mind.

Some notable features we envision for upcoming releases are:

- **Build and publish** your project as a Conda package.
- Support for **dependencies from source**.
- More powerful &quot;global installation&quot; of packages towards a deterministic setup of global packages on multiple machines.

## Installation

`pixi` can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The provided scripts will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `~/.pixi/bin`. If this directory does not exist, the script will create it.

### macOS and Linux

To install Pixi on macOS and Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
# or with brew
brew install pixi
```

The script will also update your `~/.bashrc` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your `PATH`, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.
You might need to restart your terminal or source your shell for the changes to take effect.

Starting with macOS Catalina [zsh is the default login shell and interactive shell](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102360). Therefore, you might want to use `zsh` instead of `bash` in the install command:

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | zsh
```

The script will also update your `~/.zshrc` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your `PATH`, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.

### Windows

To install Pixi on Windows, open a PowerShell terminal (you may need to run it as an administrator) and run the following command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```
Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.
Check the script you would be running with:
```powershell
powershell -c &quot;irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | more&quot;
```

The script will inform you once the installation is successful and add the `~/.pixi/bin` directory to your `PATH`, which will allow you to run the `pixi` command from any location.
Or with `winget`

```shell
winget install prefix-dev.pixi
```

### Autocompletion

To get autocompletion follow the instructions for your shell.
Afterwards, restart the shell or source the shell config file.

#### Bash (default on most Linux systems)

Add the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

eval &quot;$(pixi completion --shell bash)&quot;
```
#### Zsh (default on macOS)

Add the following to the end of `~/.zshrc`:


```zsh
# ~/.zshrc

eval &quot;$(pixi completion --shell zsh)&quot;
```

#### PowerShell (pre-installed on all Windows systems)

Add the following to the end of `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.
You can check the location of this file by querying the `$PROFILE` variable in PowerShell.
Typically the path is `~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` or
`~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` on -Nix.

```pwsh
(&amp; pixi completion --shell powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

#### Fish

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

pixi completion --shell fish | source
```

#### Nushell

Add the following to your Nushell config file (find it by running `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):

```nushell
mkdir $&quot;($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload&quot;
pixi completion --shell nushell | save --force $&quot;($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload/pixi-completions.nu&quot;
```

#### Elvish

Add the following to the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:

```elv
# ~/.elvish/rc.elv

eval (pixi completion --shell elvish | slurp)
```

### Distro Packages

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pixi.svg)](https://repology.org/project/pixi/versions)

#### Arch Linux

You can install `pixi` from the [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pixi/) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):

```shell
pacman -S pixi
```

#### Alpine Linux

`pixi` is available for [Alpine Edge](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=pixi&amp;branch=edge). It can be installed via [apk](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Package_Keeper) after enabling the [testing repository](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories).

```shell
apk add pixi
```

## Build/install from source

`pixi` is 100% written in Rust and therefore it can be installed, built and tested with cargo.
To start using `pixi` from a source build run:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git pixi
```

We don&#039;t publish to `crates.io` anymore, so you need to install it from the repository.
The reason for this is that we depend on some unpublished crates which disallows us to publish to `crates.io`.

or when you want to make changes use:

```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

If you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout
it&#039;s [compile steps](https://github.com/conda/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)

## Uninstall

To uninstall, the Pixi binary should be removed.
Delete `pixi` from the `$PIXI_DIR` which is default to `~/.pixi/bin/pixi`

So on Linux its:

```shell
rm ~/.pixi/bin/pixi
```

and on Windows:

```shell
$PIXI_BIN = &quot;$Env:LocalAppData\pixi\bin\pixi&quot;; Remove-Item -Path $PIXI_BIN
```

After this command you can still use the tools you installed with `pixi`.
To remove these as well just remove the whole `~/.pixi` directory and remove the directory from your path.

```bash
➜ pixi
A package management and workflow tool

  add         Adds a dependency to the project
  run         Runs task in project
  shell       Start a shell in the pixi environment of the project
  global      Global is the main entry point for the part of pixi that executes on the global(system) level
  auth        Login to prefix.dev or anaconda.org servers to access private channels
  install     Install all dependencies
  task        Command management in project
  info        Information about the system and project
  upload      Upload a package to a prefix.dev channel
  search      Search a package, output will list the latest version of package
  project
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

  -V, --version        Print version

```

## Creating a Pixi project

Initialize a new project and navigate to the project directory

```
pixi init myproject
cd myproject
```

Add the dependencies you want to use

```
pixi add cowpy
```

Run the installed package in its environment

```bash
pixi run cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
```

Activate a shell in the environment

```shell
pixi shell
cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
exit
```

## Installing a conda package globally

You can also globally install conda packages into their own environment.
This behavior is similar to [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) or [`condax`](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk/condax).

```bash
pixi global install cowpy
```

## Use in GitHub Actions

You can use Pixi in GitHub Actions to install dependencies and run commands.
It supports automatic caching of your environments.

```yml
- uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
- run: pixi exec cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
```

See the [documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/advanced/github_actions) for more details.
