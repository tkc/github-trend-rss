## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevy.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevy.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

## About

Turso Database is an in-process SQL database written in Rust, compatible with SQLite.

&gt; **⚠️ Warning:** This software is ALPHA, only use for development, testing, and experimentation. We are working to make it production ready, but do not use it for critical data right now.
&gt; 
## Features and Roadmap

* **SQLite compatibility** for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API [see [document](COMPAT.md) for details]
* **Change data capture (CDC)** for real-time tracking of database changes.
* **Language support** for
  * [Go](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go)
  * [JavaScript](bindings/javascript)
  * [Java](bindings/java)
  * [Python](bindings/python)
  * [Rust](bindings/rust)
  * [WebAssembly](bindings/javascript)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **Cross-platform** support for Linux, macOS, Windows and browsers (through WebAssembly)
* **Vector support** support including exact search and vector manipulation
* **Improved schema management** including extended `ALTER` support and faster schema changes.

The database has the following experimental features:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput using multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
* **Incremental computation** using DBSP for incremental view mainatenance and query subscriptions.

The following features are on our current roadmap:

* **Vector indexing** for fast approximate vector search, similar to [libSQL vector search](https://turso.tech/vector).

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the interactive shell:

```shell
$ tursodb
```

This will start the Turso interactive shell where you can execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```

If you like docker, we got you covered. Simply run this in the root folder:

```bash
make docker-cli-build &amp;&amp; \
make docker-cli-run
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/database
```

Example usage:

```js
import { connect } from &#039;@tursodatabase/database&#039;;

const db = await connect(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
uv pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦫 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go
go install github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;turso&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;☕️ Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Turso Database into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Turso Database with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🤖 MCP Server Mode&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


The Turso CLI includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your databases.

Start the MCP server with:

```shell
tursodb your_database.db --mcp
```

The MCP server provides seven tools for database interaction:

#### Available Tools

1. **`open_database`** - Open a new database
2. **`current_database`** - Describe the current database
3. **`list_tables`** - List all tables in the database
4. **`describe_table`** - Describe the structure of a specific table
5. **`execute_query`** - Execute read-only SELECT queries
6. **`insert_data`** - Insert new data into tables
7. **`update_data`** - Update existing data in tables
8. **`delete_data`** - Delete data from tables
9. **`schema_change`** - Execute schema modification statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

#### Example Usage

The MCP server runs as a single process that handles multiple JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout. Here&#039;s how to interact with it:

#### Example with In-Memory Database

EOF
```

#### Example with Existing Database

```bash
# Working with an existing database file
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb mydb.db --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
EOF
```

#### Using with Claude Code

If you&#039;re using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), you can easily connect to your Turso MCP server using the built-in MCP management commands:

##### Quick Setup

1. **Add the MCP server** to Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to activate the connection

3. **Start querying** your database through natural language!

##### Command Breakdown

```bash
claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
#              ↑            ↑       ↑                           ↑
#              |            |       |                           |
#              Name         |       Database path               MCP flag
#                          Separator
```

- **`my-database`** - Choose any name for your MCP server
- **`--`** - Required separator between Claude options and your command
- **`tursodb`** - The Turso database CLI
- **`./path/to/your/database.db`** - Path to your SQLite database file
- **`--mcp`** - Enables MCP server mode

##### Example Usage

```bash
# For a local project database
cd /your/project
claude mcp add my-project-db -- tursodb ./data/app.db --mcp

# For an absolute path
claude mcp add analytics-db -- tursodb /Users/you/databases/analytics.db --mcp

# For a specific project (local scope)
claude mcp add project-db --local -- tursodb ./database.db --mcp
```

##### Managing MCP Servers

```bash
# List all configured MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Get details about a specific server
claude mcp get my-database

# Remove an MCP server
claude mcp remove my-database
```

Once configured, you can ask Claude Code to:
- &quot;Show me all tables in the database&quot;
- &quot;What&#039;s the schema for the users table?&quot;
- &quot;Find all posts with more than 100 upvotes&quot;
- &quot;Insert a new user with name &#039;Alice&#039; and email &#039;alice@example.com&#039;&quot;
&lt;/details&gt;

## Contributing

We&#039;d love to have you contribute to Turso Database! Please check out the [contribution guide] to get started.

### Found a data corruption bug? Get up to $1,000.00

SQLite is loved because it is the most reliable database in the world. The next evolution of SQLite has
to match or surpass this level of reliability. Turso is built with [Deterministic Simulation Testing](simulator/)
from the ground up, and is also tested by [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com).

Even during Alpha, if you find a bug that leads to a data corruption and demonstrate
how our simulator failed to catch it, you can get up to $1,000.00. As the project matures we will
increase the size of the prize, and the scope of the bugs.

More details [here](https://turso.algora.io).

You can see an example of an awarded case on [#2049](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/issues/2049).

Turso core staff are not eligible.


## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

# Your procedural toolbox for 2D content creation

**Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics engine, [available now](https://editor.graphite.rs) in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.**

Having begun life as a vector editor, Graphite continues evolving into a generalized, all-in-one graphics toolbox that&#039;s built more like a game engine than a conventional creative app. The editor&#039;s tools wrap its node graph core, providing user-friendly workflows for vector, raster, and beyond. Photo editing, motion graphics, digital painting, desktop publishing, and VFX compositing are additional competencies on the planned [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#roadmap) making Graphite into a highly versatile content creation tool.

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |

| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

You can find additional [setup and configurations guides](https://getfoundry.sh/config/overview) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs] and in the [config crate](./crates/config/README.md):

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ — the state of your application
* __Messages__ — user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ — a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ — a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(&quot;A cool counter&quot;, Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

Read the [book], the [documentation], and the [examples] to learn more!

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic —  with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting, enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

developer/user communities.
However, Python has performance and typing limitations for large-scale, latency-sensitive systems. Cython addresses many of these issues by introducing static typing into Python&#039;s rich ecosystem of libraries and communities.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

**NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** or on demand.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels **ship** in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

**Note**: Wheels from the `develop` branch are only built for the Linux x86_64 platform to save time
and compute resources, while `nightly` wheels support additional platforms as shown below.

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | -       |

This process also helps preserve compute resources and ensures easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212` for December 12, 2024):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.208.0a20241212 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io

- **Reusable Workflows (Caller Jobs)**: Execute jobs that call reusable workflows via `jobs.&lt;id&gt;.uses` (local path or `owner/repo/path@ref`)
- **Output Capturing**: View logs, step outputs, and execution details
- **Parallel Job Execution**: Runs independent jobs in parallel for faster workflow execution
- **Trigger Workflows Remotely**: Manually trigger workflow runs on GitHub or GitLab

## Requirements

### Container Runtime (Optional)

WRKFLW supports multiple container runtimes for isolated execution:

- **Docker**: The default container runtime. Install from [docker.com](https://docker.com)
- **Podman**: A rootless container runtime. Perfect for environments where Docker isn&#039;t available or permitted. Install from [podman.io](https://podman.io)
- **Emulation**: No container runtime required. Executes commands directly on the host system

### Podman Support

Podman is particularly useful in environments where:
- Docker installation is not permitted by your organization
- Root privileges are not available for Docker daemon
- You prefer rootless container execution
- Enhanced security through daemonless architecture is desired

To use Podman:
```bash
# Install Podman (varies by OS)
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew install podman

# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install podman

# Initialize Podman machine (macOS/Windows)
podman machine init
podman machine start

# Use with wrkflw
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

## Installation

The recommended way to install `wrkflw` is using Rust&#039;s package manager, Cargo:

### Using Cargo Install (Recommended)
```bash
cargo install wrkflw
```

### From Source

Clone the repository and build using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bahdotsh/wrkflw.git
cd wrkflw
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available at `target/release/wrkflw`.

## Usage

The simplest way to use WRKFLW is to navigate to your project&#039;s root directory and run:

```bash
wrkflw
```

This will automatically detect and load all workflows from `.github/workflows` directory into the TUI interface.

WRKFLW also provides three main command modes:

### Validating Workflow Files

```bash
# Validate all workflow files in the default location (.github/workflows)
wrkflw validate

# Validate a specific workflow file
wrkflw validate path/to/workflow.yml

# Validate workflows in a specific directory
wrkflw validate path/to/workflows

# Validate multiple files and/or directories (GitHub and GitLab are auto-detected)
wrkflw validate path/to/flow-1.yml path/to/flow-2.yml path/to/workflows

# Force GitLab parsing for all provided paths
wrkflw validate --gitlab .gitlab-ci.yml other.gitlab-ci.yml

# Validate with verbose output
wrkflw validate --verbose path/to/workflow.yml

# Validate GitLab CI pipelines
wrkflw validate .gitlab-ci.yml --gitlab

# Disable exit codes for custom error handling (default: enabled)
wrkflw validate --no-exit-code path/to/workflow.yml
```

#### Exit Codes for CI/CD Integration

By default, `wrkflw validate` sets the exit code to `1` when validation fails, making it perfect for CI/CD pipelines and scripts:

```bash
# In CI/CD scripts - validation failure will cause the script to exit
if ! wrkflw validate; then
    echo &quot;❌ Workflow validation failed!&quot;
    exit 1
fi
echo &quot;✅ All workflows are valid!&quot;

# For custom error handling, disable exit codes
wrkflw validate --no-exit-code
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo &quot;Validation completed (check output for details)&quot;
fi
```

**Exit Code Behavior:**
- `0`: All validations passed successfully
- `1`: One or more validation failures detected
- `2`: Command usage error (invalid arguments, file not found, etc.)

### Running Workflows in CLI Mode

```bash
# Run a workflow with Docker (default)
wrkflw run .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run a workflow with Podman instead of Docker
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run a workflow in emulation mode (without containers)
wrkflw run --runtime emulation .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run with verbose output
wrkflw run --verbose .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Preserve failed containers for debugging
wrkflw run --preserve-containers-on-failure .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Using the TUI Interface

```bash
# Open TUI with workflows from the default directory
wrkflw tui

# Open TUI with a specific directory of workflows
wrkflw tui path/to/workflows

# Open TUI with a specific workflow pre-selected
wrkflw tui path/to/workflow.yml

# Open TUI with Podman runtime
wrkflw tui --runtime podman

# Open TUI in emulation mode
wrkflw tui --runtime emulation
```

### Triggering Workflows Remotely

```bash
# Trigger a workflow remotely on GitHub
wrkflw trigger workflow-name --branch main --input key1=value1 --input key2=value2

# Trigger a pipeline remotely on GitLab
wrkflw trigger-gitlab --branch main --variable key1=value1 --variable key2=value2
```

## TUI Controls

The terminal user interface provides an interactive way to manage workflows:

- **Tab / 1-4**: Switch between tabs (Workflows, Execution, Logs, Help)
- **Up/Down or j/k**: Navigate lists
- **Space**: Toggle workflow selection
- **Enter**: Run selected workflow / View job details
- **r**: Run all selected workflows
- **a**: Select all workflows
- **n**: Deselect all workflows
- **e**: Cycle through runtime modes (Docker → Podman → Emulation)
- **v**: Toggle between Execution and Validation mode
- **Esc**: Back / Exit detailed view
- **q**: Quit application

## Examples

### Validating a Workflow

```bash
$ wrkflw validate .github/workflows/rust.yml
Validating GitHub workflow file: .github/workflows/rust.yml... Validating 1 workflow file(s)...
✅ Valid: .github/workflows/rust.yml

Summary: 1 valid, 0 invalid

$ echo $?
0

# Example with validation failure
$ wrkflw validate .github/workflows/invalid.yml
Validating GitHub workflow file: .github/workflows/invalid.yml... Validating 1 workflow file(s)...
❌ Invalid: .github/workflows/invalid.yml
   1. Job &#039;test&#039; is missing &#039;runs-on&#039; field
   2. Job &#039;test&#039; is missing &#039;steps&#039; section

Summary: 0 valid, 1 invalid

$ echo $?
1
```

### Running a Workflow

```bash
$ wrkflw run .github/workflows/rust.yml

Executing workflow: .github/workflows/rust.yml
============================================================
Runtime: Docker
------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Job succeeded: build

------------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ Checkout code
  ✅ Set up Rust
  ✅ Build
  ✅ Run tests

✅ Workflow completed successfully!
```

### Quick TUI Startup

```bash
# Navigate to project root and run wrkflw
$ cd my-project
$ wrkflw

# This will automatically load .github/workflows files into the TUI
```

## System Requirements

- Rust 1.67 or later
- Container Runtime (optional, for container-based execution):
  - **Docker**: Traditional container runtime
  - **Podman**: Rootless alternative to Docker  
  - **None**: Emulation mode runs workflows using local system tools

## How It Works

WRKFLW parses your GitHub Actions workflow files and executes each job and step in the correct order. For container modes (Docker/Podman), it creates containers that closely match GitHub&#039;s runner environments. The workflow execution process:

1. **Parsing**: Reads and validates the workflow YAML structure
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Creates an execution plan based on job dependencies
3. **Environment Setup**: Prepares GitHub-like environment variables and context
4. **Execution**: Runs each job and step either in containers (Docker/Podman) or through local emulation
5. **Monitoring**: Tracks progress and captures outputs in the TUI or command line

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Environment Files Support

WRKFLW supports GitHub&#039;s environment files and special commands:

- `GITHUB_OUTPUT`: For storing step outputs (`echo &quot;result=value&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT`)
- `GITHUB_ENV`: For setting environment variables (`echo &quot;VAR=value&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV`)
- `GITHUB_PATH`: For modifying the PATH (`echo &quot;/path/to/dir&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_PATH`)
- `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`: For creating step summaries (`echo &quot;# Summary&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`)

### Composite Actions

WRKFLW supports composite actions, which are actions made up of multiple steps. This includes:

- Local composite actions referenced with `./path/to/action`
- Remote composite actions from GitHub repositories
- Nested composite actions (composite actions that use other actions)

### Container Cleanup

WRKFLW automatically cleans up any containers created during workflow execution (Docker/Podman), even if the process is interrupted with Ctrl+C.

For debugging failed workflows, you can preserve containers that fail by using the `--preserve-containers-on-failure` flag:

```bash
# Preserve failed containers for debugging
wrkflw run --preserve-containers-on-failure .github/workflows/build.yml

# Also available in TUI mode
wrkflw tui --preserve-containers-on-failure
```

When a container fails with this flag enabled, WRKFLW will:
- Keep the failed container running instead of removing it
- Log the container ID and provide inspection instructions
- Show a message like: `Preserving container abc123 for debugging (exit code: 1). Use &#039;docker exec -it abc123 bash&#039; to inspect.` (Docker)
- Or: `Preserving container abc123 for debugging (exit code: 1). Use &#039;podman exec -it abc123 bash&#039; to inspect.` (Podman)

This allows you to inspect the exact state of the container when the failure occurred, examine files, check environment variables, and debug issues more effectively.

### Podman-Specific Features

When using Podman as the container runtime, you get additional benefits:

**Rootless Operation:**
```bash
# Run workflows without root privileges
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

**Enhanced Security:**
- Daemonless architecture reduces attack surface
- User namespaces provide additional isolation
- No privileged daemon required

**Container Inspection:**
```bash
# List preserved containers
podman ps -a --filter &quot;name=wrkflw-&quot;

# Inspect a preserved container&#039;s filesystem (without executing)
podman mount &lt;container-id&gt;

# Or run a new container with the same volumes
podman run --rm -it --volumes-from &lt;failed-container&gt; ubuntu:20.04 bash

# Clean up all wrkflw containers
podman ps -a --filter &quot;name=wrkflw-&quot; --format &quot;{{.Names}}&quot; | xargs podman rm -f
```

**Compatibility:**
- Drop-in replacement for Docker workflows
- Same CLI options and behavior
- Identical container execution environment

## Limitations

### Supported Features
- ✅ Basic workflow syntax and validation (all YAML syntax checks, required fields, and structure) with proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
- ✅ Job dependency resolution and parallel execution (all jobs with correct &#039;needs&#039; relationships are executed in the right order, and independent jobs run in parallel)
- ✅ Matrix builds (supported for reasonable matrix sizes; very large matrices may be slow or resource-intensive)
- ✅ Environment variables and GitHub context (all standard GitHub Actions environment variables and context objects are emulated)
- ✅ Container actions (all actions that use containers are supported in Docker and Podman modes)
- ✅ JavaScript actions (all actions that use JavaScript are supported)
- ✅ Composite actions (all composite actions, including nested and local composite actions, are supported)
- ✅ Local actions (actions referenced with local paths are supported)
- ✅ Special handling for common actions (e.g., `actions/checkout` is natively supported)
- ✅ Reusable workflows (caller): Jobs that use `jobs.&lt;id&gt;.uses` to call local or remote workflows are executed; inputs and secrets are propagated to the called workflow
- ✅ Workflow triggering via `workflow_dispatch` (manual triggering of workflows is supported)
- ✅ GitLab pipeline triggering (manual triggering of GitLab pipelines is supported)
- ✅ Environment files (`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_PATH`, `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` are fully supported)
- ✅ TUI interface for workflow management and monitoring
- ✅ CLI interface for validation, execution, and remote triggering
- ✅ Output capturing (logs, step outputs, and execution details are available in both TUI and CLI)
- ✅ Container cleanup (all containers created by wrkflw are automatically cleaned up, even on interruption)

### Limited or Unsupported Features (Explicit List)
- ❌ GitHub secrets and permissions: Only basic environment variables are supported. GitHub&#039;s encrypted secrets and fine-grained permissions are NOT available.
- ❌ GitHub Actions cache: Caching functionality (e.g., `actions/cache`) is NOT supported in emulation mode and only partially supported in Docker and Podman modes (no persistent cache between runs).
- ❌ GitHub API integrations: Only basic workflow triggering is supported. Features like workflow status reporting, artifact upload/download, and API-based job control are NOT available.
- ❌ GitHub-specific environment variables: Some advanced or dynamic environment variables (e.g., those set by GitHub runners or by the GitHub API) are emulated with static or best-effort values, but not all are fully functional.
- ❌ Large/complex matrix builds: Very large matrices (hundreds or thousands of job combinations) may not be practical due to performance and resource limits.
- ❌ Network-isolated actions: Actions that require strict network isolation or custom network configuration may not work out-of-the-box and may require manual container runtime configuration.
- ❌ Some event triggers: Only `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger) is fully supported. Other triggers (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `release`, etc.) are NOT supported.
- ❌ GitHub runner-specific features: Features that depend on the exact GitHub-hosted runner environment (e.g., pre-installed tools, runner labels, or hardware) are NOT guaranteed to match. Only a best-effort emulation is provided.
- ❌ Windows and macOS runners: Only Linux-based runners are fully supported. Windows and macOS jobs are NOT supported.
- ❌ Service containers: Service containers (e.g., databases defined in `services:`) are only supported in Docker and Podman modes. In emulation mode, they are NOT supported.
- ❌ Artifacts: Uploading and downloading artifacts between jobs/steps is NOT supported.
- ❌ Job/step timeouts: Custom timeouts for jobs and steps are NOT enforced.
- ❌ Job/step concurrency and cancellation: Features like `concurrency` and job cancellation are NOT supported.
- ❌ Expressions and advanced YAML features: Most common expressions are supported, but some advanced or edge-case expressions may not be fully implemented.
- ⚠️ Reusable workflows (limits):
  - Outputs from called workflows are not propagated back to the caller (`needs.&lt;id&gt;.outputs.*` not supported)
  - `secrets: inherit` is not special-cased; provide a mapping to pass secrets
  - Remote calls clone public repos via HTTPS; private repos require preconfigured access (not yet implemented)
  - Deeply nested reusable calls work but lack cycle detection beyond regular job dependency checks

## Reusable Workflows

WRKFLW supports executing reusable workflow caller jobs.

### Syntax

```yaml
jobs:
  call-local:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/shared.yml

  call-remote:
    uses: my-org/my-repo/.github/workflows/shared.yml@v1
    with:
      foo: bar
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
```

### Behavior
- Local references are resolved relative to the current working directory.
- Remote references are shallow-cloned at the specified `@ref` into a temporary directory.
- `with:` entries are exposed to the called workflow as environment variables `INPUT_&lt;KEY&gt;`.
- `secrets:` mapping entries are exposed as environment variables `SECRET_&lt;KEY&gt;`.
- The called workflow executes according to its own `jobs`/`needs`; a summary of its job results is reported as a single result for the caller job.

### Current limitations
- Outputs from called workflows are not surfaced back to the caller.
- `secrets: inherit` is not supported; specify an explicit mapping.
- Private repositories for remote `uses:` are not yet supported.

### Runtime Mode Differences
- **Docker Mode**: Provides the closest match to GitHub&#039;s environment, including support for Docker container actions, service containers, and Linux-based jobs. Some advanced container configurations may still require manual setup.
- **Podman Mode**: Similar to Docker mode but uses Podman for container execution. Offers rootless container support and enhanced security. Fully compatible with Docker-based workflows.
- **🔒 Secure Emulation Mode**: Runs workflows on the local system with comprehensive sandboxing for security. **Recommended for local development**:
  - Command validation and filtering (blocks dangerous commands like `rm -rf /`, `sudo`, etc.)
  - Resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time)
  - Filesystem access controls
  - Process monitoring and limits
  - Safe for running untrusted workflows locally
- **⚠️ Emulation Mode (Legacy)**: Runs workflows using local system tools without sandboxing. **Not recommended - use Secure Emulation instead**:
  - Only supports local and JavaScript actions (no Docker container actions)
  - No support for service containers
  - No caching support
  - **No security protections - can execute harmful commands**
  - Some actions may require adaptation to work locally

### Best Practices
- **Use Secure Emulation mode for local development** - provides safety without container overhead
- Test workflows in multiple runtime modes to ensure compatibility
- **Use Docker/Podman mode for production** - provides maximum isolation and reproducibility
- Keep matrix builds reasonably sized for better performance
- Use environment variables instead of GitHub secrets when possible
- Consider using local actions for complex custom functionality
- **Review security warnings** - pay attention to blocked commands in secure emulation mode
- **Start with secure mode** - only fall back to legacy emulation if necessary

## Productive, typesafe, fullstack web framework

Directly call your backend from your frontend with our built-in type-safe RPC using [`server_fn`](http://crates.io/crates/server_fn). Supports streaming, suspense, bundle splitting, websockets, and more.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
  let mut fortune = use_signal(|| &quot;Fetch a fortune!&quot;);
  rsx! {
    h1 { &quot;{fortune}&quot; }
    button {
      onclick: move |_| async move {
        fortune.set(fetch_fortune().await.unwrap());
      }
    }
  }
}

#[server]
async fn fetch_fortune() -&gt; ServerFnResult&lt;String&gt; {
  &quot;Dioxus is super productive!&quot;.to_string()
}
```

## Bundle for web, desktop, and mobile

Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guides/assets), and more. Build WebApps weighing [less than 50kb](https://github.com/ealmloff/tiny-dioxus/) and desktop/mobile apps less than 5mb.

&lt;/div&gt;


## Fantastic documentation

We&#039;ve put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our Docs runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/) for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new Dioxus features - [check it out!](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

## Running the examples

&gt; The examples in the main branch of this repository target the git version of dioxus and the CLI. If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the [0.6 branch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples).

The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;
```

However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli to test out features like hot-reloading. To install the most recent binary CLI, you can use cargo binstall.

```sh
cargo binstall dioxus-cli@0.7.0-rc.0 --force
```

If this CLI is out-of-date, you can install it directly from git

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked
```

With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You will need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:

```sh
dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features
```

&lt;/p&gt;

## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

## Installation

Alacritty can be installed by using various package managers on Linux, BSD,
macOS and Windows.

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Windows can also be downloaded from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

For everyone else, the detailed instructions to install Alacritty can be found
[here](INSTALL.md).

### Requirements

- At least OpenGL ES 2.0
- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)

## Configuration

You can find the documentation for Alacritty&#039;s configuration in `man 5
alacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages
installed.

[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html

Alacritty doesn&#039;t create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the
following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.toml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`
5. `/etc/alacritty/alacritty.toml`

On Windows, the config file will be looked for in:

* `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty&#039;s performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn&#039;t feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it&#039;s just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won&#039;t find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

&lt;/div&gt;

[Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) is a framework providing several convenient developer tools for writing Solana programs (sometimes called &#039;smart contracts&#039;).

- Rust eDSL for writing Solana programs
- [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) specification
- TypeScript package for generating clients from IDL
- CLI and workspace management for developing complete applications

Anchor is the most popular framework for Solana programs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re familiar with developing in Ethereum&#039;s [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), then using Anchor will be familiar. Although the DSL syntax and semantics are targeted at Solana, the high level flow of writing RPC request handlers, emitting an IDL, and generating clients from IDL is the same.

## Getting Started

For a quickstart guide and in depth tutorials, see the [Anchor book](https://book.anchor-lang.com) and the [Anchor documentation](https://anchor-lang.com).

To jump straight to examples, go [here](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/tree/master/examples). For the latest Rust and TypeScript API documentation, see [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang) and the [typedoc](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/clients/typescript).

## Examples

Here&#039;s a counter program, where only the designated `authority`
can increment the count.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!(&quot;Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS&quot;);

#[program]
mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context&lt;Initialize&gt;, start: u64) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.authority = *ctx.accounts.authority.key;
        counter.count = start;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context&lt;Increment&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count += 1;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(init, payer = authority, space = 48)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
    pub system_program: Program&lt;&#039;info, System&gt;,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(mut, has_one = authority)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
}

#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub count: u64,
}
```

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils coreutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

Our key objectives include:
- Matching GNU&#039;s output (stdout and error code) exactly
- Better error messages
- Providing comprehensive internationalization support (UTF-8)
- Improved performances
- [Extensions](docs/src/extensions.md) when relevant (example: --progress)

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.

Use [weblate/rust-coreutils](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rust-coreutils/) to translate the Rust coreutils into your language.

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and GNU Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, Virtual Filesystem, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

HelixDB was built on the thesis that current database infrastructure is built for how humans think about data, not AI. So we&#039;ve built a database that makes it easy to build all the components needed for an AI application in a single platform.

You no longer need a separate application DB, vector DB, graph DB, or application layers to manage the multiple storage locations. All you need to build any application that uses AI, agents or RAG, is a single HelixDB cluster and HelixQL; we take care of the rest.

HelixDB primarily operates with a graph + vector data model, but it can also support support KV, documents, and relational data.

## Key Features

|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Built-in MCP tools**           | Helix has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than having to generate human readable queries, letting agents actually think. |
| **Built-in Embeddings**          | Don&#039;t worry about needing to embed your data before sending it to Helix, just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text.                                                     |
| **Tooling for Knowledge Graphs** | It is super easy to ingest your unstructured data into a knowledge graph, with our integrations for Zep-AI&#039;s Graphiti, and our own implementation of OpenAI&#039;s KG tool.        |
| **Tooling for RAG**              | HelixDB has a built-in vector search, keyword search, and hybrid search that can be used to power your RAG applications.                                                      |
| **Secure by Default**            | HelixDB is private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled HelixQL queries.                                                                           |
| **Logical Isolation**            | Each Helix cluster is logically isolated in its own VPC meaning only you can ever see your data.                                                                              |
| **Ultra-Low Latency**            | Helix is built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.                                                                                |

## Getting Started

#### Helix CLI

The Helix CLI tool can be used to check, compile and deploy Helix locally.

1. Install CLI

   ```bash
   curl -sSL &quot;https://install.helix-db.com&quot; | bash
   ```

2. Install Helix

   ```bash
   helix install
   ```

3. Setup

   ```bash
   helix init --path &lt;path-to-project&gt;
   ```

4. Write queries

   Open your newly created `.hx` files and start writing your schema and queries.
   Head over to [our docs](https://docs.helix-db.com/introduction/cookbook/basic) for more information about writing queries

   ```js
   QUERY addUser(name: String, age: I64) =&gt;
      user &lt;- AddN&lt;User&gt;({name: name, age: age})
      RETURN user

   QUERY getUser(user_name: String) =&gt;
      user &lt;- N&lt;User&gt;::WHERE(_::{name}::EQ(user_name))
      RETURN user
   ```

5. Check your queries compile before building them into API endpoints (optional)

   ```bash
   # in ./&lt;path-to-project&gt;
   helix check
   ```

6. Deploy your queries

   ```bash
   # in ./&lt;path-to-project&gt;
   helix deploy
   ```

7. Start calling them using our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-ts) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py). For example:

   ```typescript
   import HelixDB from &quot;helix-ts&quot;;

   // Create a new HelixDB client
   // The default port is 6969
   const client = new HelixDB();

   // Query the database
   await client.query(&quot;addUser&quot;, {
     name: &quot;John&quot;,
     age: 20,
   });

   // Get the created user
   const user = await client.query(&quot;getUser&quot;, {
     user_name: &quot;John&quot;,
   });

   console.log(user);
   ```

Other commands:

- `helix instances` to see all your local instances.
- `helix stop &lt;instance-id&gt;` to stop your local instance with specified id.
- `helix stop --all` to stop all your local instances.
- `helix dockerdev run` to start a Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev status` to check the Docker development instance status.
- `helix dockerdev logs` to view Docker container logs.
- `helix dockerdev stop` to stop the Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev delete` to remove the Docker development instance and data.

## Roadmap

Our current focus areas include:

- Organizational auth to manage teams, and Helix clusters.
- Improvements to our server code to massively improve network IO performance and scalability.
- More 3rd party integrations to make it easier to build with Helix.
- Guides and educational content to help you get started with Helix.
- Binary quantisation for even better performance.

Long term projects:

- In-house SOTA knowledge graph ingestion tool for any data source.
- In-house graph-vector storage engine (to replace LMDB)
- In-house network protocol &amp; serdes libraries (similar to protobufs/gRPC)

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: catchphrase --&gt;

## High Performance Matrix Homeserver in Rust!

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: catchphrase --&gt;

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: body --&gt;

Tuwunel is a featureful [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) homeserver you can use instead of Synapse
with your favorite [client](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/),
[bridge](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/) or
[bot](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/integrations/). It is written entirely in Rust to be a scalable,
lightweight, low-cost, community-driven alternative covering all but the most niche uses.

This project is the official successor to conduwuit, which
was a featureful and high-performance fork of [Conduit](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit), all
community-lead homeservers implementing the compatible
[Matrix Specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/).

Tuwunel is operated by enterprise users with a vested interest in sponsoring its continued
development. It is now maintained by full-time staff.

### Getting Started

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/releases)
- [Sourcecode](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/) `git clone https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel.git`
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jevolk/tuwunel) or `docker pull jevolk/tuwunel:latest`
- [GHCR](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/pkgs/container/tuwunel) or `docker pull ghcr.io/matrix-construct/tuwunel:latest`
- Static binaries available as [releases](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/releases) or [build artifacts](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/actions?query=branch%3Amain).
- Deb and RPM packages available as [releases](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/releases) or [build artifacts](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/actions?query=branch%3Amain).
- Arch package available as [tuwunel](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuwunel) or [tuwunel-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuwunel-git).
- Nix package still [needs some love](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/415469).

**1.** [Configure](https://matrix-construct.github.io/tuwunel/configuration.html) by
copying and editing the `tuwunel-example.toml`. The `server_name` and `database_path` must be
configured. **Most users deploy via docker or a distribution package and should follow the
[appropriate guide](https://matrix-construct.github.io/tuwunel/deploying.html) instead.**
This is just a summary for the impatient. See the full
[documentation](https://matrix-construct.github.io/tuwunel/).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Avoid using a sub-domain for your `server_name`. You can always delegate later with a [`.well-known`](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-well-known.md)
&gt; file, but you can never change your `server_name`.

**2.** Setup TLS certificates. Most users enjoy the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) reverse-proxy
which automates their certificate renewal. Advanced users can load their own TLS certificates
using the configuration and Tuwunel can be deployed without a reverse proxy. Example
`/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` configuration with [Element](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/releases)
unzipped to `/var/www/element`:
```
tuwunel.me, tuwunel.me:8448 {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8008
}
web.tuwunel.me {
    root * /var/www/element/
    file_server
}
```
`caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`

**3.** Start the server, connect your client and register your username. The first registration is
granted server admin.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Configure a secret `registration_token` and set `allow_registration = true`

 🤗 Did you find this and other documentation helpful? We would love to hear feedback about setting
 up Tuwunel.


### Migrating to Tuwunel

| Can I migrate from | |
|-----------------|-----------|
| conduwuit? | ✅ Yes. This will be supported at a minimum for one year, but likely indefinitely. |
| Synapse? | ❌ Not yet, but this is planned and an important issue. Subscribe to [#2](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/issues/2). |
| Conduit? | ❌ Not right now, but this is planned for the near future. Subscribe to [#41](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/issues/41). |
| Any other fork of Conduit? | ❌ No. The migration must be explicitly listed in this table. |
&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; **Never switch between different forks of Conduit or you will corrupt your database.**
&gt; All derivatives of Conduit share the same linear database version without any awareness of other
&gt; forks. The database will permanently corrupt and we will not be able to help you.

#### Migrating from conduwuit

Migrating from conduwuit to Tuwunel _just works_. In technical parlance it is a &quot;binary swap.&quot;
All you have to do is update to the latest Tuwunel and change the path to the executable from
`conduwuit` to `tuwunel`.

Anything else named &quot;conduwuit&quot; is still recognized, this includes environment variables with prefixes
such as `CONDUWUIT_`. In fact, `CONDUIT_` is still recognized for our legacy users. You may have
noticed that various configs, yamls, services, users, and other items were renamed, but if you
were a conduwuit user we recommend against changing anything at all. This will keep things simple.
If you are not sure please ask. If you found out that something did in fact need to be changed
please open an issue immediately.


### Upgrading &amp; Downgrading Tuwunel

We strive to make moving between versions of Tuwunel safe and easy. Downgrading Tuwunel is always
safe but often prevented by a guard. An error will indicate the downgrade is not possible and a
newer version which does not error must be sought.

#### Branches

The main branch is always _reasonably safe_ to run. We understand the propensity for users to simply clone
the main branch to get up and running, and we&#039;re obliged to ensure it&#039;s always viable. Nevertheless, only
tagged releases are true releases.

#### Container Tracking

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **We strongly advise tracking the `:latest` tag when automatically updating.**

Tracking `:latest` gives us the necessary discretion to keep you on the appropriate stable version.
We discourage tracking the main branch unless frequent restarts are acceptable. Alternatively,
tracking the `:preview` tag provides the latest release-candidate becoming equivalent to `:latest`
after a release. Tracking the `:preview` tag is a worthy alternative to the main branch, with
turbulence limited to release-time.

### Getting Help &amp; Support

If you are opposed to using github, or if private discussion is required such as for security
disclosures, or for any other reason, I would be happy to receive your DM at
[@jason:tuwunel.me](https://matrix.to/#/@jason:tuwunel.me). This will not be bothering me as it would
be my pleasure to help you when possible. As an emergency contact you can send an email to
jasonzemos@gmail.com.

##### Tuwunel Fanclub

We have an unofficial community-run chat which is publicly accessible at
[#tuwunel:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#tuwunel:matrix.org). The members, content, or moderation
decisions of this room are not in any way related or endorsed by this project or its sponsors,
and not all project staff will be present there. There will be at least some presence by staff to
offer assistance so long as the room remains in minimally good standing.


## Tuwunel&lt;sup&gt;💕&lt;/sup&gt;

Tuwunel&#039;s theme is **empathy** in communication defined by the works of
[Edith Stein](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stein/). Empathy is the basis for how we approach
every message and our responsibility to the other in every conversation.

-v $APP_CACHE_FOLDER:/app/cache/ \
-it aome510/spotify_player:latest
```

## Features

### Spotify Connect

To enable a full [Spotify connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) support, users will need to enable a _&quot;user-provided client integration&quot;_.

This integration can be done by following [this documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/) to register a Spotify app and then specifying the app&#039;s `client_id` in the [general configuration file](docs/config.md#general). **NOTE**: please make sure that you specify `http://127.0.0.1:8989/login` (default value of `login_redirect_uri` config option) in the **Redirect URI** section when creating the app.

Upon running `spotify_player` with a user-provided `client_id`, user will be prompted to authenticate the app described earlier. **NOTE** that this prompt is different from the prompt to authenticate `spotify_player`. Upon accepting the authentication request, `spotify_player` will retrieve an access token of the app to finish setting up the integration.

After the user-provided client is successfully integrated, press **D** (default shortcut for `SwitchDevice` command) to get the list of available devices, then press **enter** (default shortcut for `ChooseSelected` command) to connect to the selected device.

### Streaming

`spotify_player` supports streaming, which needs to be built/installed with `streaming` feature (**enabled** by default) **and** with an audio backend (`rodio-backend` by default). The streaming feature allows to `spotify_player` to play music directly from terminal.

The application uses [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library to create an integrated Spotify client while running. The integrated client will register a Spotify speaker device under the `spotify-player` name, which is accessible on the [Spotify connect](#spotify-connect) device list.

#### Audio backend

`spotify_player` uses [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio) as the default [audio backend](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends). List of available audio backends:

- `alsa-backend`
- `pulseaudio-backend`
- `rodio-backend`
- `portaudio-backend`
- `jackaudio-backend`
- `rodiojack-backend`
- `sdl-backend`
- `gstreamer-backend`

User can change the audio backend when building/installing the application by specifying the `--features` option. For example, to install `spotify_player` with `pulseaudio-backend`, run

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features pulseaudio-backend
```

**Note**:

- needs to specify `--no-default-features` here because `rodio-backend` is one of the default features.
- user will need to install additional dependencies depending on the selected audio backend. More details can be found in the [Librespot documentation](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies).

The `streaming` feature can be also disabled upon installing by running

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features
```

### Media Control

To enable media control support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `media-control` feature (**enabled** by default) and set the `enable_media_control` config option to `true` in the [general configuration file](docs/config.md#media-control).

Media control support is implemented using [MPRIS DBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) on Linux and OS window event listener on Windows and MacOS.

### Image

To enable image rendering support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `image` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `image` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features image
```

`spotify_player` supports rendering image in a full resolution if the application is run on either [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Otherwise, the image will be displayed as [block characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements).

`spotify_player` also supports rendering images with `sixel` behind `sixel` feature flag, which also enables `image` feature:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features sixel
```

**Notes**:

- Not all terminals supported by [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) are supported by `spotify_player` as it relies on a [third-party library](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer) for image rendering. A possible list of supported terminals can be found in [here](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/blob/dc81f44a97727e04be0b000712e9233c92116ff8/src/printer/sixel.rs#L83-L95).
- Images rendered by `sixel` can have a _weird_ scale. It&#039;s recommended to tweak the `cover_img_scale` config option to get the best result as the scaling works differently with different terminals and fonts.

Examples of image rendering:

- iTerm2:

- Sixel (`foot` terminal, `cover_img_scale=1.8`):

#### Pixelate

If your terminal supports high-res images, but you like the pixelated look you can enable the `pixelate` feature, which also enables the `image` feature:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features pixelate
```

The amount of pixels can be tweaked via the `cover_img_pixels` config option.

| `cover_img_pixels` | `8`                                                                                                                 | `16`                                                                                                                  | `32`                                                                                                                  | `64`                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| example            | &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;8x8&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4137aaea-ce28-4019-8cd5-2d14327e72e4&quot; /&gt; | &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;16x16&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca94748-093a-468c-8fb3-1f5639666eb6&quot; /&gt; | &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;32x32&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d0f2da-0439-47e4-91c9-3a2aa73ac90c&quot; /&gt; | &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;64x64&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06ef731-38fa-424d-9672-313f56c193d0&quot; /&gt; |

To temporarily disable the `pixelate` feature just set `cover_img_pixels` to a high value like `512`.

### Notify

To enable desktop notification support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `notify` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `notify` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features notify
```

**Note**: the notification support in `MacOS` and `Windows` are quite restricted compared to `Linux`.

### Mouse support

Currently, the only supported use case for mouse is to seek to a position of the current playback by left-clicking to such position in the playback&#039;s progress bar.

### Daemon

To enable a [daemon](&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)&gt;) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `daemon` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `daemon` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features daemon
```

You can run the application as a daemon by specifying the `-d` or `--daemon` option: `spotify_player -d`.

**Notes**:

- `daemon` feature is not supported on Windows
- `daemon` feature requires the `streaming` feature to be enabled and the application to be built with [an audio backend](#audio-backend)
- because of the OS&#039;s restrictions, `daemon` feature doesn&#039;t work with the `media-control` feature on MacOS, which is **enabled by default**. In other words, if you want to use the `daemon` feature on MacOS, you must install the application with `media-control` feature **disabled**:

  ```shell
  cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features daemon,rodio-backend
  ```

### Fuzzy search

To enable [fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `fzf` feature (**disabled** by default).

### CLI Commands

`spotify_player` offers several CLI commands to interact with Spotify:

- `get`: Get Spotify data (playlist/album/artist data, user&#039;s data, etc)
- `playback`: Interact with the playback (start a playback, play-pause, next, etc)
- `search`: Search spotify
- `connect`: Connect to a Spotify device
- `like`: Like currently playing track
- `authenticate`: Authenticate the application
- `playlist`: Playlist editing (new, delete, import, fork, etc)

For more details, run `spotify_player -h` or `spotify_player {command} -h`, in which `{command}` is a CLI command.

**Notes**

- When using the CLI for the first time, you&#039;ll need to run `spotify_player authenticate` to authenticate the application beforehand.
- Under the hood, CLI command is handled by sending requests to a `spotify_player` client socket running on port `client_port`, [a general application configuration](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md#general) with a default value of `8080`. If there is no running application&#039;s instance, a new client will be created upon handling the CLI commands, which increases the latency of the command.

#### Scripting

The `spotify_player` command-line interface makes scripting easy.
With the `search` subcommand, you can search Spotify and retrieve data in JSON format, enabling queries with tools like [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

Here’s an example of starting playback for the first track from a search query:

```sh
read -p &quot;Search spotify: &quot; query
spotify_player playback start track --id $(spotify_player search &quot;$query&quot; | jq &#039;.tracks.[0].id&#039; | xargs)
```

## Commands

To go to the shortcut help page, press `?` or `C-h` (default shortcuts for `OpenCommandHelp` command).

**Tips**:

- you can search in the shortcut help page (and some other pages) using `Search` command
- `RefreshPlayback` can be used to manually update the playback status.
- `RestartIntegratedClient` is useful when user wants to switch to another audio device (headphone, earphone, etc) without restarting the application, as the integrated client will be re-initialized with the new device.

## About The Project

| Desktop                                                                                                         | Mobile                                                                                                      |

[Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) is similar to sites like [Reddit](https://reddit.com), [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs), or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): you subscribe to forums you&#039;re interested in, post links and discussions, then vote, and comment on them. Behind the scenes, it is very different; anyone can easily run a server, and all these servers are federated (think email), and connected to the same universe, called the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).

For a link aggregator, this means a user registered on one server can subscribe to forums on any other server, and can have discussions with users registered elsewhere.

It is an easily self-hostable, decentralized alternative to Reddit and other link aggregators, outside of their corporate control and meddling.

Each Lemmy server can set its own moderation policy; appointing site-wide admins, and community moderators to keep out the trolls, and foster a healthy, non-toxic environment where all can feel comfortable contributing.

DataFusion is an extensible query engine written in [Rust] that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate provides libraries and binaries for developers building fast and
feature rich database and analytic systems, customized to particular workloads.
See [use cases] for examples. The following related subprojects target end users:

- [DataFusion Python](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/) offers a Python interface for SQL and DataFrame
  queries.
- [DataFusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/) is an accelerator for Apache Spark based on
  DataFusion.

&quot;Out of the box,&quot;
DataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs, excellent [performance],
built-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro, extensive customization, and
a great community.

DataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,
vectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can
customize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,
query languages, functions, custom operators and more.
See the [Architecture] section for more details.

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html
