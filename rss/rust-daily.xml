## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

[here](INSTALL.md).

### Requirements

- At least OpenGL ES 2.0
- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)

## Configuration

You can find the documentation for Alacritty&#039;s configuration in `man 5
alacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages
installed.

[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html

Alacritty doesn&#039;t create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the
following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.toml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`
5. `/etc/alacritty/alacritty.toml`

On Windows, the config file will be looked for in:

* `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

A guideline about contributing to Alacritty can be found in the
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty&#039;s performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn&#039;t feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it&#039;s just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won&#039;t find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

## Features and Roadmap

Turso Database is a _work-in-progress_, in-process OLTP database engine library written in Rust that has:

* **SQLite compatibility** [[doc](COMPAT.md)] for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API
* **Language bindings** for [JavaScript](bindings/javascript), [WebAssembly](bindings/wasm), [Rust](bindings/rust), [Go](bindings/go), [Python](bindings/python), and [Java](bindings/java)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **OS support** for Linux, macOS, and Windows

In the future, we will be also working on:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput.
* **Indexing for vector search**.
* **Improved schema management** including better `ALTER` support and strict column types by default.

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the shell to execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```

### MCP Server Mode

The Turso CLI includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your databases. Start the MCP server with:

```shell
tursodb your_database.db --mcp
```

The MCP server provides seven tools for database interaction:

#### Available Tools

1. **`list_tables`** - List all tables in the database
2. **`describe_table`** - Describe the structure of a specific table
3. **`execute_query`** - Execute read-only SELECT queries
4. **`insert_data`** - Insert new data into tables
5. **`update_data`** - Update existing data in tables
6. **`delete_data`** - Delete data from tables
7. **`schema_change`** - Execute schema modification statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

#### Example Usage

The MCP server runs as a single process that handles multiple JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout. Here&#039;s how to interact with it:

#### Example with In-Memory Database

```bash
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;schema_change&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 4, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;insert_data&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;Alice&#039;, &#039;alice@example.com&#039;)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;execute_query&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;}}}
EOF
```

#### Example with Existing Database

```bash
# Working with an existing database file
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb mydb.db --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
EOF
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/turso
```

Example usage:

```js
import { Database } from &#039;@tursodatabase/turso&#039;;

const db = new Database(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦫 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the library and set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include turso&#039;s target directory
```console
cargo build --package limbo-go
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/limbo/target/debug:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
3. Use the driver

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/turso
go install github.com/tursodatabase/turso
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/tursodatabase/turso&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;sqlite3&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;☕️ Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Turso Database into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Turso Database with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

## Contributing

We&#039;d love to have you contribute to Turso Database! Please check out the [contribution guide] to get started.

## Found a data corruption bug? Get up to $1,000.00

SQLite is loved because it is the most reliable database in the world. The next evolution of SQLite has
to match or surpass this level of reliability. Turso is built with [Deterministic Simulation Testing](simulator/)
from the ground up, and is also tested by [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com).

Even during Alpha, if you find a bug that leads to a data corruption and demonstrate
how our simulator failed to catch it, you can get up to $1,000.00. As the project matures we will
increase the size of the prize, and the scope of the bugs.

More details [here](https://turso.algora.io).

You can see an example of an awarded case on [#2049](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/issues/2049).

Turso core staff are not eligible.


## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

**Burn is a next generation Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on &lt;br /&gt;
flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

## Performance

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-blazingly-fast.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Because we believe the goal of a deep learning framework is to convert computation into useful
intelligence, we have made performance a core pillar of Burn. We strive to achieve top efficiency by
leveraging multiple optimization techniques described below.

**Click on each section for more details** 👇

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel fusion 💥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Using Burn means having your models optimized on any backend. When possible, we provide a way to
automatically and dynamically create custom kernels that minimize data relocation between different
memory spaces, extremely useful when moving memory is the bottleneck.

As an example, you could write your own GELU activation function with the high level tensor api (see
Rust code snippet below).

```rust
fn gelu_custom&lt;B: Backend, const D: usize&gt;(x: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
    let x = x.clone() * ((x / SQRT_2).erf() + 1);
    x / 2
}
```

Then, at runtime, a custom low-level kernel will be automatically created for your specific
implementation and will rival a handcrafted GPU implementation. The kernel consists of about 60
lines of WGSL [WebGPU Shading Language](&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/&quot;),
an extremely verbose lower level shader language you probably don&#039;t want to program your deep
learning models in!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Asynchronous execution ❤️‍🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

For [first-party backends](#backends), an asynchronous execution style
is used, which allows to perform various optimizations, such as the previously mentioned automatic
kernel fusion.

Asynchronous execution also ensures that the normal execution of the framework does not block the
model computations, which implies that the framework overhead won&#039;t impact the speed of execution
significantly. Conversely, the intense computations in the model do not interfere with the
responsiveness of the framework. For more information about our asynchronous backends, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Thread-safe building blocks 🦞
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn emphasizes thread safety by leveraging the
[ownership system of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
With Burn, each module is the owner of its weights. It is therefore possible to send a module to
another thread for computing the gradients, then send the gradients to the main thread that can
aggregate them, and _voilà_, you get multi-device training.

This is a very different approach from what PyTorch does, where backpropagation actually mutates the
_grad_ attribute of each tensor parameter. This is not a thread-safe operation and therefore
requires lower level synchronization primitives, see
[distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) for reference. Note that
this is still very fast, but not compatible across different backends and quite hard to implement.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Intelligent memory management 🦀
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

One of the main roles of a deep learning framework is to reduce the amount of memory necessary to
run models. The naive way of handling memory is that each tensor has its own memory space, which is
allocated when the tensor is created then deallocated as the tensor gets out of scope. However,
allocating and deallocating data is very costly, so a memory pool is often required to achieve good
throughput. Burn offers an infrastructure that allows for easily creating and selecting memory
management strategies for backends. For more details on memory management in Burn, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

Another very important memory optimization of Burn is that we keep track of when a tensor can be
mutated in-place just by using the ownership system well. Even though it is a rather small memory
optimization on its own, it adds up considerably when training or running inference with larger
models and contributes to reduce the memory usage even more. For more information, see
[this blog post about tensor handling](https://burn.dev/blog/burn-rusty-approach-to-tensor-handling).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel selection 🎯
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A good deep learning framework should ensure that models run smoothly on all hardware. However, not
all hardware share the same behavior in terms of execution speed. For instance, a matrix
multiplication kernel can be launched with many different parameters, which are highly sensitive to
the size of the matrices and the hardware. Using the wrong configuration could reduce the speed of
execution by a large factor (10 times or even more in extreme cases), so choosing the right kernels
becomes a priority.

With our home-made backends, we run benchmarks automatically and choose the best configuration for
the current hardware and matrix sizes with a reasonable caching strategy.

This adds a small overhead by increasing the warmup execution time, but stabilizes quickly after a
few forward and backward passes, saving lots of time in the long run. Note that this feature isn&#039;t
mandatory, and can be disabled when cold starts are a priority over optimized throughput.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Hardware specific features 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is no secret that deep learning is mostly relying on matrix multiplication as its core operation,
since this is how fully-connected neural networks are modeled.

More and more, hardware manufacturers optimize their chips specifically for matrix multiplication
workloads. For instance, Nvidia has its _Tensor Cores_ and today most cellphones have AI specialized
chips. As of this moment, we support Tensor Cores with our LibTorch, Candle, CUDA, Metal and WGPU/SPIR-V
backends, but not other accelerators yet. We hope
[this issue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4195) gets resolved at some point to bring
support to our WGPU backend.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Custom Backend Extension 🎒
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn aims to be the most flexible deep learning framework. While it&#039;s crucial to maintain
compatibility with a wide variety of backends, Burn also provides the ability to extend the
functionalities of a backend implementation to suit your personal modeling requirements.

This versatility is advantageous in numerous ways, such as supporting custom operations like flash
attention or manually writing your own kernel for a specific backend to enhance performance. See
[this section](https://burn.dev/books/burn/advanced/backend-extension/index.html) in the Burn Book 🔥
for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust implementations.
We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your models in the cloud,
then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Supported Backends**

| Backend  | Devices                      | Class       |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| CUDA     | NVIDIA GPUs                  | First-Party |
| ROCm     | AMD GPUs                     | First-Party |
| Metal    | Apple GPUs                   | First-Party |
| Vulkan   | Most GPUs on Linux &amp; Windows | First-Party |
| Wgpu     | Most GPUs                    | First-Party |
| NdArray  | Most CPUs                    | Third-Party |
| LibTorch | Most GPUs &amp; CPUs             | Third-Party |
| Candle   | Nvidia, Apple GPUs &amp; CPUs    | Third-Party |

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend 🔄
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
For now, only the WGPU and CUDA backends have support for fused kernels.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Fusion, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Fusion&lt;Wgpu&gt;&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}

```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server.
The client sends tensor operations over the network to a remote compute backend.
You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand 👇**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard 📈
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption 🛡

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support 🐫
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-standard format that exports both the architecture
and the weights of a deep learning model.

Burn supports the importation of models that follow the ONNX standard so you can easily port a model
you have written in another framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn to benefit from all the
advantages our framework offers.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch or Safetensors Models 🚚
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You can load weights from PyTorch or Safetensors formats directly into your Burn-defined models. This makes it easy to reuse existing models while benefiting from Burn&#039;s performance and deployment features.

Learn more:

- [Import pre-trained PyTorch models into Burn](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/pytorch-model.html)
- [Load models from Safetensors format](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/safetensors-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser 🌐
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can compile to Web Assembly: Candle and NdArray for CPU, and WGPU for GPU.
This means that you can run inference directly within a browser. We provide several examples of
this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2️⃣ 7️⃣ 😰
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! 🌄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ⚙️
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).

&gt; ⚠️ **Warning**
&gt; When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency chain.
&gt; To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file:
&gt;
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.

## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/books/burn/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests 😄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples 🙏
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        l

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is the open-source reactive database designed to
make life easy for web app developers, whether human or LLM. Fetch data and
perform business logic with strong consistency by writing pure TypeScript.

Convex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client
libraries. It makes it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.
[Read the docs to learn more](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/).

Development of the Convex backend is led by the Convex team. We
[welcome bug fixes](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[love receiving feedback](https://discord.gg/convex). We keep this repository
synced with any internal development work within a handful of days.

## Getting Started

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/) to learn more about Convex
and follow our getting started guides.

The easiest way to build with Convex is through our
[cloud platform](https://www.convex.dev/plans), which includes a generous free
tier and lets you focus on building your application without worrying about
infrastructure. Many small applications and side-projects can operate entirely
on the free tier with zero cost and zero maintenance.

## Self Hosting

The self-hosted product includes most features of the cloud product, including
the dashboard and CLI. Self-hosted Convex works well with a variety of tools
including Neon, Fly.io, Vercel, Netlify, RDS, Sqlite, Postgres, and more.

You can either use Docker (recommended) or a prebuilt binary to self host
Convex. Check out our [self-hosting guide](./self-hosted/README.md) for detailed
instructions. Community support for self-hosting is available in the
`#self-hosted` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/convex).

## Community &amp; Support

- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/convex) for help and
  discussions.
- Report issues when building and using the open source Convex backend through
  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend/issues)

## Building from source

See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md).

## Disclaimers

- If you choose to self-host, we recommend following the self-hosting guide. If
  you are instead building from source, make sure to change your instance secret
  and admin key from the defaults in the repo.
- Convex is battle tested most thoroughly on Linux and Mac. On Windows, it has
  less experience. If you run into issues, please message us on
  [Discord](https://convex.dev/community) in the `#self-hosted` channel.
- Convex self-hosted builds contain a beacon to help Convex improve the product.
  The information is minimal and anonymous and helpful to Convex, but if you
  really want to disable it, you can set the `--disable-beacon` flag on the
  backend binary. The beacon&#039;s messages print in the log and only include
  - A random identifier for your deployment (not used elsewhere)
  - Migration version of your database
  - Git rev of the backend
  - Uptime of the backend

## Repository layout

- `crates/` contains Rust code

  - Main binary
    - `local_backend/` is an application server on top of the `Runtime`. This is
      the serving edge for the Convex cloud.

- `npm-packages/` contains both our public and internal TypeScript packages.
  - Internal packages
    - `udf-runtime/` sets up the user-defined functions JS environment for
      queries and mutations
    - `udf-tests/` is a collection of functions used in testing the isolate
      layer
    - `system-udfs/` contains functions used by the Convex system e.g. the CLI

Candle is a minimalist ML framework for Rust with a focus on performance (including GPU support) 
and ease of use. Try our online demos: 
[whisper](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-whisper),
[LLaMA2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2),
[T5](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/Candle-T5-Generation-Wasm),
[yolo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-yolo),
[Segment
Anything](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/candle-segment-anything-wasm).

## Get started

Make sure that you have [`candle-core`](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/tree/main/candle-core) correctly installed as described in [**Installation**](https://huggingface.github.io/candle/guide/installation.html).

Let&#039;s see how to run a simple matrix multiplication.
Write the following to your `myapp/src/main.rs` file:
```rust
use candle_core::{Device, Tensor};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let device = Device::Cpu;

    let a = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (2, 3), &amp;device)?;
    let b = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (3, 4), &amp;device)?;

    let c = a.matmul(&amp;b)?;
    println!(&quot;{c}&quot;);
    Ok(())
}
```

`cargo run` should display a tensor of shape `Tensor[[2, 4], f32]`.


Having installed `candle` with Cuda support, simply define the `device` to be on GPU:

```diff
- let device = Device::Cpu;
+ let device = Device::new_cuda(0)?;
```

For more advanced examples, please have a look at the following section.

## FAQ

### Why should I use Candle?

&lt;!--- ANCHOR: goals ---&gt;

Candle&#039;s core goal is to *make serverless inference possible*. Full machine learning frameworks like PyTorch
are very large, which makes creating instances on a cluster slow. Candle allows deployment of lightweight
binaries.

Secondly, Candle lets you *remove Python* from production workloads. Python overhead can seriously hurt performance,
and the [GIL](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-python-gil-past-present-and-future/) is a notorious source of headaches.

Finally, Rust is cool! A lot of the HF ecosystem already has Rust crates, like [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) and [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).

&lt;!--- ANCHOR_END: goals ---&gt;

### Other ML frameworks

- [dfdx](https://github.com/coreylowman/dfdx) is a formidable crate, with shapes being included
  in types. This prevents a lot of headaches by getting the compiler to complain about shape mismatches right off the bat.
  However, we found that some features still require nightly, and writing code can be a bit daunting for non rust experts.

  We&#039;re leveraging and contributing to other core crates for the runtime so hopefully both crates can benefit from each
  other.

- [burn](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn) is a general crate that can leverage multiple backends so you can choose the best
  engine for your workload.

- [tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs.git) Bindings to the torch library in Rust. Extremely versatile, but they 
  bring in the entire torch library into the runtime. The main contributor of `tch-rs` is also involved in the development
  of `candle`.

### Common Errors

#### Missing symbols when compiling with the mkl feature.

If you get some missing symbols when compiling binaries/tests using the mkl
or accelerate features, e.g. for mkl you get:
```
  = note: /usr/bin/ld: (....o): in function `blas::sgemm&#039;:
          .../blas-0.22.0/src/lib.rs:1944: undefined reference to `sgemm_&#039; collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  = note: some `extern` functions couldn&#039;t be found; some native libraries may need to be installed or have their path specified
  = note: use the `-l` flag to specify native libraries to link
  = note: use the `cargo:rustc-link-lib` directive to specify the native libraries to link with Cargo
```
or for accelerate:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
            &quot;_dgemm_&quot;, referenced from:
                candle_core::accelerate::dgemm::h1b71a038552bcabe in libcandle_core...
            &quot;_sgemm_&quot;, referenced from:
                candle_core::accelerate::sgemm::h2cf21c592cba3c47 in libcandle_core...
          ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
```

This is likely due to a missing linker flag that was needed to enable the mkl library. You
can try adding the following for mkl at the top of your binary:
```rust
extern crate intel_mkl_src;
```
or for accelerate:
```rust
extern crate accelerate_src;
```

#### Cannot run the LLaMA examples: access to source requires login credentials

```
Error: request error: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf/resolve/main/tokenizer.json: status code 401
```

This is likely because you&#039;re not permissioned for the LLaMA-v2 model. To fix
this, you have to register on the huggingface-hub, accept the [LLaMA-v2 model
conditions](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf), and set up your
authentication token. See issue
[#350](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/350) for more details.

#### Missing cute/cutlass headers when compiling flash-attn

```
  In file included from kernels/flash_fwd_launch_template.h:11:0,
                   from kernels/flash_fwd_hdim224_fp16_sm80.cu:5:

**DISCLAIMER**: Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for anything that
could happen to your phone.

&lt;img src=&quot;/resources/screenshots/v0.5.0.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; alt=&quot;uad_screenshot&quot;&gt;

**This software is still in an early stage of development. Check out the issues, and feel free to contribute!**

## Summary

This is a complete rewrite in Rust of the [UAD project](https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater),
which aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary
and obscure system apps.
This can also contribute to improve security by reducing [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface).

Packages are as well documented as possible in order to provide a better
understanding of what you can delete or not. The worst issue that could happen
is removing an essential system package needed during boot causing then an unfortunate
bootloop. After about 5 failed system boots, the phone will automatically reboot
in recovery mode, and you&#039;ll have to perform a FACTORY RESET. Make a backup first!

In any case, you **CANNOT** brick your device with this software!
That&#039;s the main point, right?

## Features

- [x] Uninstall/Disable and Restore/Enable system packages
- [x] Multi-user support (e.g. apps in work profiles)
- [x] Export/Import your selection in `uad_exported_selection.txt`
- [x] Multi-device support: you can connect multiple phones at the same time
- [x] All your actions are logged, so you never forget what you&#039;ve done

NB : System apps cannot truly be uninstalled without root (see the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ))

## How to use it

- **Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ)!**
- **Do a proper backup of your data! You can never be too careful!**
- Enable _Developer Options_ on your smartphone.
- Turn on _USB Debugging_ from the developer panel.
- From the settings, disconnect from any OEM accounts (when you delete an OEM
  account package it could lock you on the lockscreen because the phone can&#039;t
  associate your identity anymore)
- Install ADB (see the intructions by clicking on your OS below):
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;LINUX&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install _Android platform tools_ on your PC :

  Debian Base:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools
  ```

  Arch-Linux Base:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S android-tools
  ```

  Red Hat Base:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install android-tools
  ```

  OpenSUSE Base:

  ```bash
  sudo zypper install android-tools
  ```

  &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;MAC OS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Install _Android platform tools_

    ```bash
    brew install android-platform-tools
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;WINDOWS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Download [android platform tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)
    and unzip it somewhere.
  - [Add the android platform tools to your PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)
    **OR** make sure to launch UAD from the same directory.

  - [Install USB drivers for your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#Drivers)
  - Check your device is detected:

    ```bash
     adb devices
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

- Download the latest release of UAD GUI for your Operating System [here](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/releases).
  Take the `opengl` version only if the default version (with a Vulkan backend)
  doesn&#039;t launch.

**NOTE:** Chinese phones users may need to use the AOSP list for removing some stock
apps because those Chinese manufacturers (especially Xiaomi and Huawei) have been
using the name of AOSP packages for their own (modified &amp; closed-source) apps.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You will have to run this software whenever your OEM pushes
an update to your phone as some _uninstalled_ system apps could be reinstalled.

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevy.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevy.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. Its based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

## Docs

The official docs are hosted [here][docs]. Each individual component also has accompanying developer documentation for contributors, which you can find in each `README.md`.

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

[Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) is a framework providing several convenient developer tools for writing Solana programs (sometimes called &#039;smart contracts&#039;).

- Rust eDSL for writing Solana programs
- [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) specification
- TypeScript package for generating clients from IDL
- CLI and workspace management for developing complete applications

Anchor is the most popular framework for Solana programs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re familiar with developing in Ethereum&#039;s [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), then using Anchor be familiar. Although the DSL syntax and semantics are targeted at Solana, the high level flow of writing RPC request handlers, emitting an IDL, and generating clients from IDL is the same.

## Getting Started

For a quickstart guide and in depth tutorials, see the [Anchor book](https://book.anchor-lang.com) and the [Anchor documentation](https://anchor-lang.com).

To jump straight to examples, go [here](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/tree/master/examples). For the latest Rust and TypeScript API documentation, see [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang) and the [typedoc](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/clients/typescript).

## Examples

Here&#039;s a counter program, where only the designated `authority`
can increment the count.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!(&quot;Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS&quot;);

#[program]
mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context&lt;Initialize&gt;, start: u64) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.authority = *ctx.accounts.authority.key;
        counter.count = start;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context&lt;Increment&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count += 1;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(init, payer = authority, space = 48)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
    pub system_program: Program&lt;&#039;info, System&gt;,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(mut, has_one = authority)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
}

#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub count: u64,
}
```

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What Can I Do with Hyperswitch?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Hyperswitch offers a modular, open-source payments infrastructure designed for flexibility and control. Apart from our Payment Suite offering, this solution allows businesses to pick and integrate only the modules they need on top of their existing payment stack — without unnecessary complexity or vendor lock-in.

Each module is independent and purpose-built to optimize different aspects of payment processing.

## Quickstart 

&lt;h3&gt; Local Setup via Docker &lt;/h3&gt;

```bash
# One-click local setup

git clone --depth 1 --branch latest https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch

cd hyperswitch

scripts/setup.sh
```
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This script: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Detects Docker/Podman  
  - Offers multiple deployment profiles:
    - **Standard**: App server + Control Center  
    - **Full**: Includes monitoring + schedulers  
    - **Minimal**: Standalone App server  
  - Provides access links when done

  If you need further help, check out our [video tutorial](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/overview/unified-local-setup-using-docker).  

  👉 After setup, [configure a connector](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/account-setup/using-hyperswitch-control-center#add-a-payment-processor) and [test a payment](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/account-setup/test-a-payment).
&lt;/details&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Hosted Sandbox (No Setup Required)&lt;/h3&gt;

Hyperswitch offers a fully hosted sandbox environment that requires no setup. You can explore the Control Center, configure payment connectors, and test payments directly from the UI.

   &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.hyperswitch.io&quot;&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/imgs/try-the-sandbox.png?raw=true&quot; height=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What you can do in the Hosted Sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Access the full Control Center  
  - Configure payment connectors  
  - View logs, routing rules, and retry strategies  
  - Try payments directly from the UI  
&lt;/details&gt;

## Why Hyperswitch?

Hyperswitch is a commercial open-source payments stack purpose-built for scale, flexibility, and developer experience. Designed with a modular architecture, Hyperswitch lets you pick only the components you need—whether it’s routing, retries, vaulting, or observability—without vendor lock-in or bloated integrations.

Built in Rust for performance and reliability, Hyperswitch supports global payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL, UPI, Pay by Bank), exposes smart routing and retry logic, and provides a visual workflow builder in the Control Center. Whether you&#039;re integrating a full payment suite or augmenting an existing stack with a single module, Hyperswitch meets you where you are.

&lt;strong&gt;“Linux for Payments”&lt;/strong&gt; — Hyperswitch is a well-architected reference for teams who want to own their payments stack.

We believe in:

- &lt;strong&gt; Embracing Payment Diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; Innovation comes from enabling choice—across payment methods, processors, and flows.

## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic —  with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto and Betting, enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

developer/user communities.
However, Python has performance and typing limitations for large-scale, latency-sensitive systems. Cython addresses many of these issues by introducing static typing into Python&#039;s rich ecosystem of libraries and communities.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

**NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** or on demand.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels **ship** in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) is [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) compliant and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

**Note**: Wheels from the `develop` branch are only built for the Linux x86_64 platform to save time
and compute resources, while `nightly` wheels support additional platforms as shown below.

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | -       |

This process also helps preserve compute resources and ensures easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We don&#039;t recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip installs the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212` for December 12, 2024):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.208.0a20241212 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).

To programmatically fetch and list available versions:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP &#039;(?&lt;=&lt;a href=&quot;)[^&quot;]+(?=&quot;)&#039; | awk -F&#039;#&#039; &#039;{print $1}&#039; | sort
```

## Troubleshooting

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;See details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that may arise are likely due to your system missing dependencies
required to correctly analyze a network adapter. &lt;br&gt;
Check the [required dependencies page](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Required-dependencies) 
for instructions on how to proceed depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not updated,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may manifest bugs (the interface glitches, color gradients are unsupported, or some icons are completely black). &lt;br&gt;
In these cases you can set an environment variable to switch to the `tiny-skia` renderer,
a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment:

```sh
ICED_BACKEND=tiny-skia
```

### ***In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/new/choose), and I will do my best to help you!***

&lt;/details&gt;

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Embassy

Embassy is the next-generation framework for embedded applications. Write safe, correct, and energy-efficient embedded code faster, using the Rust programming language, its async facilities, and the Embassy libraries.

## [Documentation](https://embassy.dev/book/index.html) - [API reference](https://docs.embassy.dev/) - [Website](https://embassy.dev/) - [Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#embassy-rs:matrix.org)

## Rust + async ❤️ embedded

The Rust programming language is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime, garbage collector, or OS. It catches a wide variety of bugs at compile time, thanks to its full memory- and thread-safety, and expressive type system.

Rust&#039;s [async/await](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/) allows for unprecedentedly easy and efficient multitasking in embedded systems. Tasks get transformed at compile time into state machines that get run cooperatively. It requires no dynamic memory allocation and runs on a single stack, so no per-task stack size tuning is required. It obsoletes the need for a traditional RTOS with kernel context switching, and is [faster and smaller than one!](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown)

## Batteries included

- **Hardware Abstraction Layers**
    - HALs implement safe, idiomatic Rust APIs to use the hardware capabilities, so raw register manipulation is not needed. The Embassy project maintains HALs for select hardware, but you can still use HALs from other projects with Embassy.
    - [embassy-stm32](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/), for all STM32 microcontroller families.
    - [embassy-nrf](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-nrf/), for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF54 and nRF91 series.
    - [embassy-rp](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/), for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP23xx microcontrollers.
    - [embassy-mspm0](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-mspm0/), for the Texas Instruments MSPM0 microcontrollers.
    - [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs), for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of chips.
        - Embassy HAL support for Espressif chips, as well as Async Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ESP-NOW, is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repository.
    - [ch32-hal](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal), for the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series of chips.
    - [mpfs-hal](https://github.com/AlexCharlton/mpfs-hal), for the Microchip PolarFire SoC.
    - [py32-hal](https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-hal), for the Puya Semiconductor PY32 series of microcontrollers.

- **Time that Just Works** -
  No more messing with hardware timers. [embassy_time](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time) provides Instant, Duration, and Timer types that are globally available and never overflow.

- **Real-time ready** -
  Tasks on the same async executor run cooperatively, but you can create multiple executors with different priorities so that higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones. See the [example](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/master/examples/nrf52840/src/bin/multiprio.rs).

- **Low-power ready** -
  Easily build devices with years of battery life. The async executor automatically puts the core to sleep when there&#039;s no work to do. Tasks are woken by interrupts, there is no busy-loop polling while waiting.

- **Networking** -
  The [embassy-net](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/) network stack implements extensive networking functionality, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and DHCP. Async drastically simplifies managing timeouts and serving multiple connections concurrently.

- **Bluetooth**
    - The [trouble](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble) crate provides a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x Host that runs on any microcontroller implementing the [bt-hci](https://github.com/embassy-rs/bt-hci) traits (currently
      `nRF52`, `rp2040`, `rp23xx` and `esp32` and `serial` controllers are supported).
    - The [nrf-softdevice](https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice) crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x support for nRF52 microcontrollers.
    - The [embassy-stm32-wpan](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-stm32-wpan) crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 5.x support for stm32wb microcontrollers.

- **LoRa** -
  The [lora-rs](https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs) project provides an async LoRa and LoRaWAN stack that works well on Embassy.

- **USB** -
  [embassy-usb](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-usb/) implements a device-side USB stack. Implementations for common classes such as USB serial (CDC ACM) and USB HID are available, and a rich builder API allows building your own.

- **Bootloader and DFU** -
  [embassy-boot](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/master/embassy-boot) is a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks.

## Sneak peek

```rust,ignore
use defmt::info;
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_time::{Duration, Timer};
use embassy_nrf::gpio::{AnyPin, Input, Level, Output, OutputDrive, Pin, Pull};
use embassy_nrf::{Peri, Peripherals};

// Declare async tasks
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn blink(pin: Peri&lt;&#039;static, AnyPin&gt;) {
    let mut led = Output::new(pin, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard);

    loop {
        // Timekeeping is globally available, no need to mess with hardware timers.
        led.set_high();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
        led.set_low();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
    }
}

// Main is itself an async task as well.
#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());

    // Spawned tasks run in the background, concurrently.
    spawner.spawn(blink(p.P0_13.into())).unwrap();

    let mut button = Input::new(p.P0_11, Pull::Up);
    loop {
        // Asynchronously wait for GPIO events, allowing other tasks
        // to run, or the core to sleep.
        button.wait_for_low().await;
        info!(&quot;Button pressed!&quot;);
        button.wait_for_high().await;
        info!(&quot;Button released!&quot;);
    }
}
```

## Examples

Examples are found in the
`examples/` folder separated by the chip manufacturer they are designed to run on. For example:

* `examples/nrf52840` run on the
  `nrf52840-dk` board (PCA10056) but should be easily adaptable to other nRF52 chips and boards.
* `examples/nrf5340` run on the `nrf5340-dk` board (PCA10095).
* `examples/stm32xx` for the various STM32 families.
* `examples/rp` are for the RP2040 chip.
* `examples/std` are designed to run locally on your PC.

### Running examples

- Install `probe-rs` following the instructions at &lt;https://probe.rs&gt;.
- Change directory to the sample&#039;s base directory. For example:

```bash
cd examples/nrf52840
```

- Ensure `Cargo.toml` sets the right feature for the name of the chip you are programming.
  If this name is incorrect, the example may fail to run or immediately crash
  after being programmed.

- Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` contains the name of the chip you are programming.

- Run the example

For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin blinky
```

For more help getting started, see [Getting Started][1] and [Running the Examples][2].

## Developing Embassy with Rust Analyzer-based editors

The [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is used by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and others. Given the multiple targets that Embassy serves, there is no Cargo workspace file. Instead, the Rust Analyzer
must be told of the target project to work with. In the case of Visual Studio Code,
please refer to the `.vscode/settings.json` file&#039;s `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects`setting.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

Embassy is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.75 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions, but that may change in any new patch release.

## Why the name?

EMBedded ASYnc! :)

  &lt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&gt;)

   &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Loco&lt;/h1&gt;

   &lt;h3&gt;
   &lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;description&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt; --&gt;
🚂 Loco is Rust on Rails.
&lt;!--&lt;/snip&gt; --&gt;
   &lt;/h3&gt;

## What&#039;s Loco?
`Loco` is strongly inspired by Rails. If you know Rails and Rust, you&#039;ll feel at home. If you only know Rails and new to Rust, you&#039;ll find Loco refreshing. We do not assume you know Rails.

For a deeper dive into how Loco works, including detailed guides, examples, and API references, check out our [documentation website](https://loco.rs).


## Features of Loco:

* `Convention Over Configuration:` Similar to Ruby on Rails, Loco emphasizes simplicity and productivity by reducing the need for boilerplate code. It uses sensible defaults, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than spending time on configuration.

* `Rapid Development:` Aim for high developer productivity, Loco’s design focuses on reducing boilerplate code and providing intuitive APIs, allowing developers to iterate quickly and build prototypes with minimal effort.

* `ORM Integration:` Model your business with robust entities, eliminating the need to write SQL. Define relationships, validation, and custom logic directly on your entities for enhanced maintainability and scalability.

* `Controllers`: Handle web requests parameters, body, validation, and render a response that is content-aware. We use Axum for the best performance, simplicity, and extensibility. Controllers also allow you to easily build middlewares, which can be used to add logic such as authentication, logging, or error handling before passing requests to the main controller actions.

* `Views:` Loco can integrate with templating engines to generate dynamic HTML content from templates.

* `Background Jobs:` Perform compute or I/O intensive jobs in the background with a Redis backed queue, or with threads. Implementing a worker is as simple as implementing a perform function for the Worker trait.

* `Scheduler:` Simplifies the traditional, often cumbersome crontab system, making it easier and more elegant to schedule tasks or shell scripts.

* `Mailers:` A mailer will deliver emails in the background using the existing loco background worker infrastructure. It will all be seamless for you.

* `Storage:` In Loco Storage, we facilitate working with files through multiple operations. Storage can be in-memory, on disk, or use cloud services such as AWS S3, GCP, and Azure.

* `Cache:` Loco provides an cache layer to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data.

So see more Loco features, check out our [documentation website](https://loco.rs/docs/getting-started/tour/).



## Getting Started
&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;quick-installation-command&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
cargo install loco
cargo install sea-orm-cli # Only when DB is needed
```
&lt;!-- &lt;/snip&gt; --&gt;

Now you can create your new app (choose &quot;`SaaS` app&quot;).


&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;loco-cli-new-from-template&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
❯ loco new
✔ ❯ App name? · myapp
✔ ❯ What would you like to build? · Saas App with client side rendering
✔ ❯ Select a DB Provider · Sqlite
✔ ❯ Select your background worker type · Async (in-process tokio async tasks)

🚂 Loco app generated successfully in:
myapp/

- assets: You&#039;ve selected `clientside` for your asset serving configuration.

Next step, build your frontend:
  $ cd frontend/
  $ npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build
```
&lt;!-- &lt;/snip&gt; --&gt;

 Now `cd` into your `myapp` and start your app:
&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;starting-the-server-command-with-output&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
$ cargo loco start

# MicroBin

![Build](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/microbin.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/microbin)
[![Docker Image](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/danielszabo99/microbin)
[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/danielszabo99/microbin?label=Docker%20pulls)](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/danielszabo99/microbin?label=Docker%20pulls)

MicroBin is a super tiny, feature-rich, configurable, self-contained and self-hosted paste bin web application. It is very easy to set up and use, and will only require a few megabytes of memory and disk storage. It takes only a couple minutes to set it up, why not give it a try now?

### Check out the Public Test Server at [pub.microbin.eu](https://pub.microbin.eu)!

### Or host MicroBin yourself

Run our quick docker setup script ([DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/danielszabo99/microbin)):
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -s https://microbin.eu/docker.sh)
```

Or install it manually from [Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/microbin):

```bash
cargo install microbin;
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szabodanika/microbin/master/.env;
source .env;
microbin
```

On our website [microbin.eu](https://microbin.eu), you will find the following:

- [Screenshots](https://microbin.eu/screenshots/)
- [Guide and Documentation](https://microbin.eu/docs/intro)
- [Donations and Sponsorships](https://microbin.eu/sponsorship)
- [Roadmap](https://microbin.eu/roadmap)

## Features

- Entirely self-contained executable, MicroBin is a single file!
- Server-side and client-side encryption
- File uploads (e.g. `server.com/file/pig-dog-cat`)
- Raw text serving (e.g. `server.com/raw/pig-dog-cat`)
- QR code support
- URL shortening and redirection
- Animal names instead of random numbers for upload identifiers (64 animals)
- SQLite and JSON database support
- Private and public, editable and uneditable, automatically and never expiring uploads
- Automatic dark mode and custom styling support with very little CSS and only vanilla JS (see [`water.css`](https://github.com/kognise/water.css))
- And much more!

## What is an upload?

In MicroBin, an upload can be:

- A text that you want to paste from one machine to another, e.g. some code,
- A file that you want to share, e.g. a video that is too large for Discord, a zip with a code project in it or an image,
- A URL redirection.

## When is MicroBin useful?

You can use MicroBin:

- To send long texts to other people,
- To send large files to other people,
- To share secrets or sensitive documents securely,
- As a URL shortener/redirect service,
- To serve content on the web, eg . configuration files for testing, images, or any other file content using the Raw functionality,
- To move files between your desktop and a server you access from the console,
- As a &quot;postbox&quot; service where people can upload their files or texts, but they cannot see or remove what others sent you,
- Or even to take quick notes.

...and many other things, why not get creative?

MicroBin and MicroBin.eu are available under the [BSD 3-Clause License](LICENSE).

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [📖 Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio&#039;s zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust&#039;s ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system&#039;s event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc.).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

[net]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html
[scheduler]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you activated the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1.46.1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

## Supported Rust Versions

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- tokio/README.md
- tokio/Cargo.toml
- tokio-util/Cargo.toml
- tokio-test/Cargo.toml
- tokio-stream/Cargo.toml
--&gt;

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.70.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.39 to now  - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn&#039;t follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

 * `1.38.x` - LTS release until July 2025. (MSRV 1.63)
 * `1.43.x` - LTS release until March 2026. (MSRV 1.70)

Each LTS release will continue to receive backported fixes for at least a year.
If you wish to use a fixed minor release in your project, we recommend that you
use an LTS release.

To use a fixed minor version, you can specify the version with a tilde. For
example, to specify that you wish to use the newest `1.32.x` patch release, you
can use the following dependency specification:
```text
tokio = { version = &quot;~1.38&quot;, features = [...] }
```

### Previous LTS releases

 * `1.8.x` - LTS release until February 2022.
 * `1.14.x` - LTS release until June 2022.
 * `1.18.x` - LTS release until June 2023.
 * `1.20.x` - LTS release until September 2023.
 * `1.25.x` - LTS release until March 2024.
 * `1.32.x` - LTS release until September 2024.
 * `1.36.x` - LTS release until March 2025.
