            <h2>README</h2><pre># GPUI Component

[![Build Status](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Docs](https://docs.rs/gpui-component/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/gpui-component/) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gpui-component.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/gpui-component)

UI components for building fantastic desktop applications using [GPUI](https://gpui.rs).

## Features

- **Richness**: 60+ cross-platform desktop UI components.
- **Native**: Inspired by macOS and Windows controls, combined with shadcn/ui design for a modern experience.
- **Ease of Use**: Stateless `RenderOnce` components, simple and user-friendly.
- **Customizable**: Built-in `Theme` and `ThemeColor`, supporting multi-theme and variable-based configurations.
- **Versatile**: Supports sizes like `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg`.
- **Flexible Layout**: Dock layout for panel arrangements, resizing, and freeform (Tiles) layouts.
- **High Performance**: Virtualized Table and List components for smooth large-data rendering.
- **Content Rendering**: Native support for Markdown and simple HTML.
- **Charting**: Built-in charts for visualizing your data.
- **Editor**: High performance code editor (support up to 200K lines) with LSP (diagnostics, completion, hover, etc).
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for editor and markdown components using Tree Sitter.

## Showcase

Here is the first application: [Longbridge Pro](https://longbridge.com/desktop), built using GPUI Component.

&lt;img width=&quot;1763&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1ecb9c3-2dd3-431e-bd97-5a819c30e551&quot; /&gt;

We built multi-theme support in the application. This feature is not included in GPUI Component itself, but is based on the `Theme` feature, so it&#039;s easy to implement.

## Usage

GPUI and GPUI Component are still in development, so you need to add dependencies by git.

```toml
gpui = &quot;0.2.2&quot;
gpui-component = &quot;0.3.0&quot;
```

### Basic Example

```rs
use gpui::*;
use gpui_component::{button::*, *};

pub struct HelloWorld;
impl Render for HelloWorld {
    fn render(&amp;mut self, _: &amp;mut Window, _: &amp;mut Context&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; impl IntoElement {
        div()
            .v_flex()
            .gap_2()
            .size_full()
            .items_center()
            .justify_center()
            .child(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
            .child(
                Button::new(&quot;ok&quot;)
                    .primary()
                    .label(&quot;Let&#039;s Go!&quot;)
                    .on_click(|_, _, _| println!(&quot;Clicked!&quot;)),
            )
    }
}

fn main() {
    let app = Application::new();

    app.run(move |cx| {
        // This must be called before using any GPUI Component features.
        gpui_component::init(cx);

        cx.spawn(async move |cx| {
            cx.open_window(WindowOptions::default(), |window, cx| {
                let view = cx.new(|_| HelloWorld);
                // This first level on the window, should be a Root.
                cx.new(|cx| Root::new(view.into(), window, cx))
            })?;

            Ok::&lt;_, anyhow::Error&gt;(())
        })
        .detach();
    });
}
```

### WebView

&gt; Still early and experimental; there are a lot of limitations.

GPUI Component has a `WebView` element based on [Wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry). This is an optional feature, which you can enable with a feature flag.

```toml
gpui-component = { version = &quot;0.3.0&quot;, features = [&quot;webview&quot;] }
wry = { version = &quot;0.53.3, package = &quot;lb-wry&quot; }
```

More usage examples can be found in the [story](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/tree/main/crates/story) directory.

### Icons

GPUI Component has an `Icon` element, but it does not include SVG files by default.

The example uses [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons, but you can use any icons you like. Just name the SVG files as defined in [IconName](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/blob/main/crates/ui/src/icon.rs#L86). You can add any icons you need to your project.

## Development

We have a gallery of applications built with GPUI Component.

```bash
cargo run
```

More examples can be found in the `examples` directory. You can run them with `cargo run --example &lt;example_name&gt;`.

&gt; Why did the developer choose goose as their AI agent?
&gt; 
&gt; Because it always helps them &quot;migrate&quot; their code to production! 🚀

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [📖 Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils coreutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

Our key objectives include:
- Matching GNU&#039;s output (stdout and error code) exactly
- Better error messages
- Providing comprehensive internationalization support (UTF-8)
- Improved performances
- [Extensions](docs/src/extensions.md) when relevant (example: --progress)

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.

Use [weblate/rust-coreutils](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rust-coreutils/) to translate the Rust coreutils into your language.

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and GNU Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

To build SELinux-specific features, including `chcon` and `runcon`, ensure that `libselinux` 
and `libclang` are installed on your system. Then, run the following command:
```
cargo build --release --features unix,feat_selinux
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
# Install uudoc first
cargo install --bin uudoc --features uudoc --path .

# Then use the installed binary
uudoc completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
uudoc completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls.bash
```

Completion for prefixed `cp` with `uu-` on `zsh` is generated by
```shell
env PROG_PREFIX=uu- uudoc completion cp zsh
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
# Install uudoc first
cargo install --bin uudoc --features uudoc --path .

# Then use the installed binary
uudoc manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
uudoc manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Embassy

Embassy is the next-generation framework for embedded applications. Write safe, correct, and energy-efficient embedded code faster, using the Rust programming language, its async facilities, and the Embassy libraries.

## [Documentation](https://embassy.dev/book/index.html) - [API reference](https://docs.embassy.dev/) - [Website](https://embassy.dev/) - [Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#embassy-rs:matrix.org)

## Rust + async ❤️ embedded

The Rust programming language is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime, garbage collector, or OS. It catches a wide variety of bugs at compile time, thanks to its full memory- and thread-safety, and expressive type system.

Rust&#039;s [async/await](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/) allows for unprecedentedly easy and efficient multitasking in embedded systems. Tasks get transformed at compile time into state machines that get run cooperatively. It requires no dynamic memory allocation and runs on a single stack, so no per-task stack size tuning is required. It obsoletes the need for a traditional RTOS with kernel context switching, and is [faster and smaller than one!](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown)

## Batteries included

- **Hardware Abstraction Layers**
    - HALs implement safe, idiomatic Rust APIs to use the hardware capabilities, so raw register manipulation is not needed. The Embassy project maintains HALs for select hardware, but you can still use HALs from other projects with Embassy.
    - [embassy-stm32](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/), for all STM32 microcontroller families.
    - [embassy-nrf](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-nrf/), for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF54 and nRF91 series.
    - [embassy-rp](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/), for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP23xx microcontrollers.
    - [embassy-mspm0](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-mspm0/), for the Texas Instruments MSPM0 microcontrollers.
    - [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs), for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of chips.
        - Embassy HAL support for Espressif chips, as well as Async Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ESP-NOW, is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repository.
    - [ch32-hal](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal), for the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series of chips.
    - [mpfs-hal](https://github.com/AlexCharlton/mpfs-hal), for the Microchip PolarFire SoC.
    - [py32-hal](https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-hal), for the Puya Semiconductor PY32 series of microcontrollers.

- **Time that Just Works** -
  No more messing with hardware timers. [embassy_time](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time) provides Instant, Duration, and Timer types that are globally available and never overflow.

- **Real-time ready** -
  Tasks on the same async executor run cooperatively, but you can create multiple executors with different priorities so that higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones. See the [example](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/master/examples/nrf52840/src/bin/multiprio.rs).

- **Low-power ready** -
  Easily build devices with years of battery life. The async executor automatically puts the core to sleep when there&#039;s no work to do. Tasks are woken by interrupts, there is no busy-loop polling while waiting.

- **Networking** -
  The [embassy-net](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/) network stack implements extensive networking functionality, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and DHCP. Async drastically simplifies managing timeouts and serving multiple connections concurrently.

- **Bluetooth**
    - The [trouble](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble) crate provides a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x Host that runs on any microcontroller implementing the [bt-hci](https://github.com/embassy-rs/bt-hci) traits (currently
      `nRF52`, `rp2040`, `rp23xx` and `esp32` and `serial` controllers are supported).
    - The [nrf-softdevice](https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice) crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x support for nRF52 microcontrollers.
    - The [embassy-stm32-wpan](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-stm32-wpan) crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 5.x support for stm32wb microcontrollers.

- **LoRa** -
  The [lora-rs](https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs) project provides an async LoRa and LoRaWAN stack that works well on Embassy.

- **USB** -
  [embassy-usb](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-usb/) implements a device-side USB stack. Implementations for common classes such as USB serial (CDC ACM) and USB HID are available, and a rich builder API allows building your own.

- **Bootloader and DFU** -
  [embassy-boot](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/master/embassy-boot) is a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks.

## Sneak peek

```rust,ignore
use defmt::info;
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_time::{Duration, Timer};
use embassy_nrf::gpio::{AnyPin, Input, Level, Output, OutputDrive, Pin, Pull};
use embassy_nrf::{Peri, Peripherals};

// Declare async tasks
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn blink(pin: Peri&lt;&#039;static, AnyPin&gt;) {
    let mut led = Output::new(pin, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard);

    loop {
        // Timekeeping is globally available, no need to mess with hardware timers.
        led.set_high();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
        led.set_low();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
    }
}

// Main is itself an async task as well.
#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());

    // Spawned tasks run in the background, concurrently.
    spawner.spawn(blink(p.P0_13.into()).unwrap());

    let mut button = Input::new(p.P0_11, Pull::Up);
    loop {
        // Asynchronously wait for GPIO events, allowing other tasks
        // to run, or the core to sleep.
        button.wait_for_low().await;
        info!(&quot;Button pressed!&quot;);
        button.wait_for_high().await;
        info!(&quot;Button released!&quot;);
    }
}
```

## Examples

Examples are found in the
`examples/` folder separated by the chip manufacturer they are designed to run on. For example:

* `examples/nrf52840` run on the
  `nrf52840-dk` board (PCA10056) but should be easily adaptable to other nRF52 chips and boards.
* `examples/nrf5340` run on the `nrf5340-dk` board (PCA10095).
* `examples/stm32xx` for the various STM32 families.
* `examples/rp` are for the RP2040 chip.
* `examples/std` are designed to run locally on your PC.

### Running examples

- Install `probe-rs` following the instructions at &lt;https://probe.rs&gt;.
- Change directory to the sample&#039;s base directory. For example:

```bash
cd examples/nrf52840
```

- Ensure `Cargo.toml` sets the right feature for the name of the chip you are programming.
  If this name is incorrect, the example may fail to run or immediately crash
  after being programmed.

- Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` contains the name of the chip you are programming.

- Run the example

For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin blinky
```

For more help getting started, see [Getting Started][1] and [Running the Examples][2].

## Developing Embassy with Rust Analyzer-based editors

The [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is used by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and others. Given the multiple targets that Embassy serves, there is no Cargo workspace file. Instead, the Rust Analyzer
must be told of the target project to work with. In the case of Visual Studio Code,
please refer to the `.vscode/settings.json` file&#039;s `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects`setting.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

Embassy is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.75 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions, but that may change in any new patch release.

## Why the name?

EMBedded ASYnc! :)

&lt;br /&gt;

SQLx is an async, pure Rust&lt;sub&gt;†&lt;/sub&gt; SQL crate featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL.

-   **Truly Asynchronous**. Built from the ground-up using async/await for maximum concurrency.

-   **Compile-time checked queries** (if you want). See [SQLx is not an ORM](#sqlx-is-not-an-orm).

-   **Database Agnostic**. Support for [PostgreSQL], [MySQL], [MariaDB], [SQLite].
    -   [MSSQL] was supported prior to version 0.7, but has been removed pending a full rewrite of the driver as part of our [SQLx Pro initiative].

-   **Pure Rust**. The Postgres and MySQL/MariaDB drivers are written in pure Rust using **zero** unsafe&lt;sub&gt;††&lt;/sub&gt; code.

-   **Runtime Agnostic**. Works on different runtimes ([`async-std`] / [`tokio`] / [`actix`]) and TLS backends ([`native-tls`], [`rustls`]).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;

† The SQLite driver uses the libsqlite3 C library as SQLite is an embedded database (the only way
we could be pure Rust for SQLite is by porting _all_ of SQLite to Rust).

†† SQLx uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` unless the `sqlite` feature is enabled.
The SQLite driver directly invokes the SQLite3 API via `libsqlite3-sys`, which requires `unsafe`.

&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

---

-   Cross-platform. Being native Rust, SQLx will compile anywhere Rust is supported.

-   Built-in connection pooling with `sqlx::Pool`.

-   Row streaming. Data is read asynchronously from the database and decoded on demand.

-   Automatic statement preparation and caching. When using the high-level query API (`sqlx::query`), statements are
    prepared and cached per connection.

-   Simple (unprepared) query execution including fetching results into the same `Row` types used by
    the high-level API. Supports batch execution and returns results from all statements.

-   Transport Layer Security (TLS) where supported ([MySQL], [MariaDB] and [PostgreSQL]).

-   Asynchronous notifications using `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for [PostgreSQL].

-   Nested transactions with support for save points.

-   `Any` database driver for changing the database driver at runtime. An `AnyPool` connects to the driver indicated by the URL scheme.

## Install

SQLx is compatible with the [`async-std`], [`tokio`], and [`actix`] runtimes; and, the [`native-tls`] and [`rustls`] TLS backends. When adding the dependency, you must choose a runtime feature that is `runtime` + `tls`.

[`async-std`]: https://github.com/async-rs/async-std
[`tokio`]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio
[`actix`]: https://github.com/actix/actix-net
[`native-tls`]: https://crates.io/crates/native-tls
[`rustls`]: https://crates.io/crates/rustls

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
# PICK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

# tokio (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot; ] }
# tokio + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }

# async-std (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot; ] }
# async-std + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }
```

#### Cargo Feature Flags

For backward-compatibility reasons, the runtime and TLS features can either be chosen together as a single feature,
or separately.

For forward compatibility, you should use the separate runtime and TLS features as the combination features may
be removed in the future.

-   `runtime-async-std`: Use the `async-std` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-tokio`: Use the `tokio` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

    - Actix-web is fully compatible with Tokio and so a separate runtime feature is no longer needed.

-   `tls-native-tls`: Use the `native-tls` TLS backend (OpenSSL on *nix, SChannel on Windows, Secure Transport on macOS).

-   `tls-rustls`: Use the `rustls` TLS backend (cross-platform backend, only supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3).

-   `postgres`: Add support for the Postgres database server.

-   `mysql`: Add support for the MySQL/MariaDB database server.

-   `mssql`: Add support for the MSSQL database server.

-   `sqlite`: Add support for the self-contained [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database engine with SQLite bundled and statically-linked.

-   `sqlite-unbundled`: The same as above (`sqlite`), but link SQLite from the system instead of the bundled version.
    * Allows updating SQLite independently of SQLx or using forked versions.
    * You must have SQLite installed on the system or provide a path to the library at build time.
       See [the `rusqlite` README](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite?tab=readme-ov-file#notes-on-building-rusqlite-and-libsqlite3-sys) for details.
    * May result in link errors if the SQLite version is too old. Version `3.20.0` or newer is recommended.
    * Can increase build time due to the use of bindgen.

-   `sqlite-preupdate-hook`: enables SQLite&#039;s [preupdate hook](https://sqlite.org/c3ref/preupdate_count.html) API.
    * Exposed as a separate feature because it&#039;s generally not enabled by default.
    * Using this feature with `sqlite-unbundled` may cause linker failures if the system SQLite version does not support it.

-   `any`: Add support for the `Any` database driver, which can proxy to a database driver at runtime.

-   `derive`: Add support for the derive family macros, those are `FromRow`, `Type`, `Encode`, `Decode`.

-   `macros`: Add support for the `query*!` macros, which allows compile-time checked queries.

-   `migrate`: Add support for the migration management and `migrate!` macro, which allow compile-time embedded migrations.

-   `uuid`: Add support for UUID.

-   `chrono`: Add support for date and time types from `chrono`.

-   `time`: Add support for date and time types from `time` crate (alternative to `chrono`, which is preferred by `query!` macro, if both enabled)

-   `bstr`: Add support for `bstr::BString`.

-   `bigdecimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `bigdecimal` crate.

-   `rust_decimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `rust_decimal` crate.

-   `ipnet`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnet` crate.

-   `ipnetwork`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnetwork` crate.

-   `json`: Add support for `JSON` and `JSONB` (in postgres) using the `serde_json` crate.

-   Offline mode is now always enabled. See [sqlx-cli/README.md][readme-offline].

## SQLx is not an ORM!

SQLx supports **compile-time checked queries**. It does not, however, do this by providing a Rust
API or DSL (domain-specific language) for building queries. Instead, it provides macros that take
regular SQL as input and ensure that it is valid for your database. The way this works is that
SQLx connects to your development DB at compile time to have the database itself verify (and return
some info on) your SQL queries. This has some potentially surprising implications:

- Since SQLx never has to parse the SQL string itself, any syntax that the development DB accepts
  can be used (including things added by database extensions)
- Due to the different amount of information databases let you retrieve about queries, the extent of
  SQL verification you get from the query macros depends on the database

**If you are looking for an (asynchronous) ORM,** you can check out our new [Ecosystem wiki page](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/wiki/Ecosystem#orms)!

## Usage

See the `examples/` folder for more in-depth usage.

### Quickstart

```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPoolOptions;
// use sqlx::mysql::MySqlPoolOptions;
// etc.

#[async_std::main] // Requires the `attributes` feature of `async-std`
// or #[tokio::main]
// or #[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    // Create a connection pool
    //  for MySQL/MariaDB, use MySqlPoolOptions::new()
    //  for SQLite, use SqlitePoolOptions::new()
    //  etc.
    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .connect(&quot;postgres://postgres:password@localhost/test&quot;).await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter (use a question mark `?` instead of `$1` for MySQL/MariaDB)
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as(&quot;SELECT $1&quot;)
        .bind(150_i64)
        .fetch_one(&amp;pool).await?;

    assert_eq!(row.0, 150);

    Ok(())
}
```


### Connecting

A single connection can be established using any of the database connection types and calling `connect()`.

```rust
use sqlx::Connection;

let conn = SqliteConnection::connect(&quot;sqlite::memory:&quot;).await?;
```

Generally, you will want to instead create a connection pool (`sqlx::Pool`) for the application to
regulate how many server-side connections it&#039;s using.

```rust
let pool = MySqlPool::connect(&quot;mysql://user:pass@host/database&quot;).await?;
```

### Querying

In SQL, queries can be separated into prepared (parameterized) or unprepared (simple). Prepared queries have their
query plan _cached_, use a binary mode of communication (lower bandwidth and faster decoding), and utilize parameters
to avoid SQL injection. Unprepared queries are simple and intended only for use where a prepared statement
will not work, such as various database commands (e.g., `PRAGMA` or `SET` or `BEGIN`).

SQLx supports all operations with both types of queries. In SQLx, a `&amp;str` is treated as an unprepared query,
and a `Query` or `QueryAs` struct is treated as a prepared query.

```rust
// low-level, Executor trait
conn.execute(&quot;BEGIN&quot;).await?; // unprepared, simple query
conn.execute(sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;)).await?; // prepared, cached query
```

We should prefer to use the high-level `query` interface whenever possible. To make this easier, there are finalizers
on the type to avoid the need to wrap with an executor.

```rust
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;mut conn).await?;
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;pool).await?;
```

The `execute` query finalizer returns the number of affected rows, if any, and drops all received results.
In addition, there are `fetch`, `fetch_one`, `fetch_optional`, and `fetch_all` to receive results.

The `Query` type returned from `sqlx::query` will return `Row&lt;&#039;conn&gt;` from the database. Column values can be accessed
by ordinal or by name with `row.get()`. As the `Row` retains an immutable borrow on the connection, only one
`Row` may exist at a time.

The `fetch` query finalizer returns a stream-like type that iterates through the rows in the result sets.

```rust
// provides `try_next`
use futures_util::TryStreamExt;
// provides `try_get`
use sqlx::Row;

let mut rows = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?&quot;)
    .bind(email)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);

while let Some(row) = rows.try_next().await? {
    // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    let email: &amp;str = row.try_get(&quot;email&quot;)?;
}
```

To assist with mapping the row into a domain type, one of two idioms may be used:

```rust
let mut stream = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
    .map(|row: PgRow| {
        // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    })
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct User { name: String, id: i64 }

let mut stream = sqlx::query_as::&lt;_, User&gt;(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? OR name = ?&quot;)
    .bind(user_email)
    .bind(user_name)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

Instead of a stream of results, we can use `fetch_one` or `fetch_optional` to request one required or optional result
from the database.

### Compile-time verification

We can use the macro, `sqlx::query!` to achieve compile-time syntactic and semantic verification of the SQL, with
an output to an anonymous record type where each SQL column is a Rust field (using raw identifiers where needed).

```rust
let countries = sqlx::query!(
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;{ country: String, count: i64 }&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

Differences from `query()`:

-   The input (or bind) parameters must be given all at once (and they are compile-time validated to be
    the right number and the right type).

-   The output type is an anonymous record. In the above example the type would be similar to:

    ```rust
    { country: String, count: i64 }
    ```

-   The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be set at build time to a database which it can prepare
    queries against; the database does not have to contain any data but must be the same
    kind (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) and have the same schema as the database you will be connecting to at runtime.

    For convenience, you can use [a `.env` file][dotenv]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to set DATABASE_URL so that you don&#039;t have to pass it every time:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mysql://localhost/my_database
    ```

[dotenv]: https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv#examples

The biggest downside to `query!()` is that the output type cannot be named (due to Rust not
officially supporting anonymous records). To address that, there is a `query_as!()` macro that is
mostly identical except that you can name the output type.

```rust
// no traits are needed
struct Country { country: String, count: i64 }

let countries = sqlx::query_as!(Country,
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;Country&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

To avoid the need of having a development database around to compile the project even when no
modifications (to the database-accessing parts of the code) are done, you can enable &quot;offline mode&quot;
to cache the results of the SQL query analysis using the `sqlx` command-line tool. See
[sqlx-cli/README.md](./sqlx-cli/README.md#enable-building-in-offline-mode-with-query).

Compile-time verified queries do quite a bit of work at compile time. Incremental actions like
`cargo check` and `cargo build` can be significantly faster when using an optimized build by
putting the following in your `Cargo.toml` (More information in the
[Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html) of The Cargo Book)

```toml
[profile.dev.package.sqlx-macros]
opt-level = 3
```

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The `dotenv` crate itself appears abandoned as of [December 2021](https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv/issues/74)
so we now use the `dotenvy` crate instead. The file format is the same.

## Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% Safe Rust.

If the `sqlite` feature is enabled, this is downgraded to `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` on the
`sqlx::sqlite` module. There are several places where we interact with the C SQLite API. We try to document each call for the invariants we&#039;re assuming. We absolutely welcome auditing of, and feedback on, our unsafe code usage.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Bottlerocket OS

Welcome to Bottlerocket!

Bottlerocket is a free and open-source Linux-based operating system meant for hosting containers.

To learn more about Bottlerocket, visit the [official Bottlerocket website and documentation](https://bottlerocket.dev/).
Otherwise, if you’re ready to jump right in, read one of our setup guides for running Bottlerocket in [Amazon EKS](QUICKSTART-EKS.md), [Amazon ECS](QUICKSTART-ECS.md), or [VMware](QUICKSTART-VMWARE.md).
If you&#039;re interested in running Bottlerocket on bare metal servers, please refer to the [provisioning guide](PROVISIONING-METAL.md) to get started.

Bottlerocket focuses on security and maintainability, providing a reliable, consistent, and safe platform for container-based workloads.
This is a reflection of what we&#039;ve learned building operating systems and services at Amazon.
You can read more about what drives us in [our charter](CHARTER.md).

The base operating system has just what you need to run containers reliably, and is built with standard open-source components.
Bottlerocket-specific additions focus on reliable updates and on the API.
Instead of making configuration changes manually, you can change settings with an API call, and these changes are automatically migrated through updates.

Some notable features include:

* [API access](#api) for configuring your system, with secure out-of-band [access methods](#exploration) when you need them.
* [Updates](#updates) based on partition flips, for fast and reliable system updates.
* [Modeled configuration](#settings) that&#039;s automatically migrated through updates.
* [Security](#security) as a top priority.

You can let us know about things that seem difficult, or even ways you might like to help.

## Variants

To start, we&#039;re focusing on the use of Bottlerocket as a host OS in AWS EKS Kubernetes clusters and Amazon ECS clusters.
We’re excited to get early feedback and to continue working on more use cases!

Bottlerocket is architected such that different cloud environments and container orchestrators can be supported in the future.
A build of Bottlerocket that supports different features or integration characteristics is known as a &#039;variant&#039;.
The artifacts of a build will include the architecture and variant name.
For example, an `x86_64` build of the `aws-k8s-1.32` variant will produce an image named `bottlerocket-aws-k8s-1.32-x86_64-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;commit&gt;.img`.

The following variants support EKS, as described above:

* `aws-k8s-1.28`
* `aws-k8s-1.29`
* `aws-k8s-1.30`
* `aws-k8s-1.31`
* `aws-k8s-1.32`
* `aws-k8s-1.33`
* `aws-k8s-1.34`
* `aws-k8s-1.28-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.29-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.30-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.31-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.32-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.33-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.34-nvidia`

The following variants support ECS:

* `aws-ecs-2`
* `aws-ecs-2-nvidia`

We also have variants that are designed to be Kubernetes worker nodes in VMware:

* `vmware-k8s-1.28`
* `vmware-k8s-1.29`
* `vmware-k8s-1.30`
* `vmware-k8s-1.31`
* `vmware-k8s-1.32`
* `vmware-k8s-1.33`
* `vmware-k8s-1.34`

The following variants are no longer supported:

* All Kubernetes variants using Kubernetes 1.27 and earlier
* VMware variants using Kubernetes 1.27 and earlier
* Bare metal variants for Kubernetes
* ECS-1 variants

We recommend users replace nodes running these variants with the [latest variant compatible with their cluster](variants/).

## Architectures

Our supported architectures include `x86_64` and `aarch64` (written as `arm64` in some contexts).

## Setup

:walking: :running:

Bottlerocket is best used with a container orchestrator.
To get started with Kubernetes in Amazon EKS, please see [QUICKSTART-EKS](QUICKSTART-EKS.md).
To get started with Kubernetes in VMware, please see [QUICKSTART-VMWARE](QUICKSTART-VMWARE.md).
To get started with Amazon ECS, please see [QUICKSTART-ECS](QUICKSTART-ECS.md).
These guides describe:

* how to set up a cluster with the orchestrator, so your Bottlerocket instance can run containers
* how to launch a Bottlerocket instance in EC2 or VMware

To see how to provision Bottlerocket on bare metal, see [PROVISIONING-METAL](PROVISIONING-METAL.md).

To build your own Bottlerocket images, please see [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).
It describes:

* how to build an image
* how to register an EC2 AMI from an image

To publish your built Bottlerocket images, please see [PUBLISHING](PUBLISHING.md).
It describes:

* how to make TUF repos including your image
* how to copy your AMI across regions
* how to mark your AMIs public or grant access to specific accounts
* how to make your AMIs discoverable using [SSM parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html)

## Exploration

To improve security, there&#039;s no SSH server in a Bottlerocket image, and not even a shell.

Don&#039;t panic!

There are a couple out-of-band access methods you can use to explore Bottlerocket like you would a typical Linux system.
Either option will give you a shell within Bottlerocket.
From there, you can [change settings](#settings), manually [update Bottlerocket](#updates), debug problems, and generally explore.

**Note:** These methods require that your instance has permission to access the ECR repository where these containers live; the appropriate policy to add to your instance&#039;s IAM role is `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`.

### Control container

Bottlerocket has a [&quot;control&quot; container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container), enabled by default, that runs outside of the orchestrator in a separate instance of containerd.
This container runs the [AWS SSM agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent) that lets you run commands, or start shell sessions, on Bottlerocket instances in EC2.
(You can easily replace this control container with your own just by changing the URI; see [Settings](#settings).)

In AWS, you need to give your instance the SSM role for this to work; see the [setup guide](QUICKSTART-EKS.md#enabling-ssm).
Outside of AWS, you can use [AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html).
There&#039;s more detail about hybrid environments in the [control container documentation](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container/#connecting-to-aws-systems-manager-ssm).

Once the instance is started, you can start a session:

* Go to AWS SSM&#039;s [Session Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/session-manager/sessions)
* Select &quot;Start session&quot; and choose your Bottlerocket instance
* Select &quot;Start session&quot; again to get a shell

If you prefer a command-line tool, you can start a session with a recent [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and the [session-manager-plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html).
Then you&#039;d be able to start a session using only your instance ID, like this:

```shell
aws ssm start-session --target INSTANCE_ID --region REGION_CODE
```

With the [default control container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container), you can make [API calls](#api) to configure and manage your Bottlerocket host.
To do even more, read the next section about the [admin container](#admin-container).
You can access the admin container from the control container like this:

```shell
enter-admin-container
```

### Admin container

Bottlerocket has an [administrative container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container), disabled by default, that runs outside of the orchestrator in a separate instance of containerd.
This container has an SSH server that lets you log in as `ec2-user` using your EC2-registered SSH key.
Outside of AWS, you can [pass in your own SSH keys](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container#authenticating-with-the-admin-container).
(You can easily replace this admin container with your own just by changing the URI; see [Settings](#settings).

To enable the container, you can change the setting in user data when starting Bottlerocket, for example EC2 instance user data:

```toml
[settings.host-containers.admin]
enabled = true
```

If Bottlerocket is already running, you can enable the admin container from the default [control container](#control-container) like this:

```shell
enable-admin-container
```

Or you can start an interactive session immediately like this:

```shell
enter-admin-container
```

If you&#039;re using a custom control container, or want to make the API calls directly, you can enable the admin container like this instead:

```shell
apiclient set host-containers.admin.enabled=true
```

Once you&#039;ve enabled the admin container, you can either access it through SSH or execute commands from the control container like this:

```shell
apiclient exec admin bash
```

Once you&#039;re in the admin container, you can run `sheltie` to get a full root shell in the Bottlerocket host.
Be careful; while you can inspect and change even more as root, Bottlerocket&#039;s filesystem and dm-verity setup will prevent most changes from persisting over a restart - see [Security](#security).

## Updates

Rather than a package manager that updates individual pieces of software, Bottlerocket downloads a full filesystem image and reboots into it.
It can automatically roll back if boot failures occur, and workload failures can trigger manual rollbacks.

The update process uses images secured by [TUF](https://theupdateframework.github.io/).
For more details, see the [update system documentation](sources/updater/).

### Update methods

There are several ways of updating your Bottlerocket hosts.
We provide tools for automatically updating hosts, as well as an API for direct control of updates.

#### Automated updates

For EKS variants of Bottlerocket, we recommend using the [Bottlerocket update operator](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-update-operator) for automated updates.

For the ECS variant of Bottlerocket, we recommend using the [Bottlerocket ECS updater](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-ecs-updater/) for automated updates.

#### Update API

The [Bottlerocket API](#api) includes methods for checking and starting system updates.
You can read more about the update APIs in our [update system documentation](sources/updater/README.md#update-api).

apiclient knows how to handle those update APIs for you, and you can run it from the [control](#control-container) or [admin](#admin-container) containers.

To see what updates are available:

```shell
apiclient update check
```

If an update is available, it will show up in the `chosen_update` field.
The `available_updates` field will show the full list of available versions, including older versions, because Bottlerocket supports safely rolling back.

To apply the latest update:

```shell
apiclient update apply
```

The next time you reboot, you&#039;ll start up in the new version, and system configuration will be automatically [migrated](sources/api/migration/).
To reboot right away:

```shell
apiclient reboot
```

If you&#039;re confident about updating, the `apiclient update apply` command has `--check` and `--reboot` flags to combine the above actions, so you can accomplish all of the above steps like this:

```shell
apiclient update apply --check --reboot
```

See the [apiclient documentation](sources/api/apiclient/) for more details.

### Update rollback

The system will automatically roll back if it&#039;s unable to boot.
If the update is not functional for a given container workload, you can do a manual rollback:

```shell
signpost rollback-to-inactive
reboot
```

This doesn&#039;t require any external communication, so it&#039;s quicker than `apiclient`, and it&#039;s made to be as reliable as possible.

## Settings

Here we&#039;ll describe the settings you can configure on your Bottlerocket instance, and how to do it.

(API endpoints are defined in our [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-core-kit/tree/develop/sources/api/openapi.yaml) if you want more detail.)

### Interacting with settings

#### Using the API client

You can see the current settings with an API request:

```shell
apiclient get settings
```

This will return all of the current settings in JSON format.
For example, here&#039;s an abbreviated response:

```json
{&quot;motd&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, {&quot;kubernetes&quot;: {}}}
```

You can change settings like this:

```shell
apiclient set motd=&quot;hi there&quot; kubernetes.node-labels.environment=test
```

You can also use a JSON input mode to help change many related settings at once, and a &quot;raw&quot; mode if you want more control over how the settings are committed and applied to the system.
See the [apiclient README](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-core-kit/tree/develop/sources/api/apiclient/) for details.

#### Using user data

If you know what settings you want to change when you start your Bottlerocket instance, you can send them in the user data.

In user data, we structure the settings in TOML form to make things a bit simpler.
Here&#039;s the user data to change the message of the day setting, as we did in the last section:

```toml
[settings]
motd = &quot;my own value!&quot;
```

If your user data is over the size limit of the platform (e.g. 16KiB for EC2) you can compress the contents with gzip.
(With [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), you can use `--user-data fileb:///path/to/gz-file` to pass binary data.)

### Description of settings

Here we&#039;ll describe each setting you can change.

**Note:** You can see the default values (for any settings that are not generated at runtime) by looking in the `defaults.d` directory for a variant, for example [aws-ecs-2](sources/models/src/aws-ecs-2/defaults.d/).

When you&#039;re sending settings to the API, or receiving settings from the API, they&#039;re in a structured JSON format.
This allows modification of any number of keys at once.
It also lets us ensure that they fit the definition of the Bottlerocket data model - requests with invalid settings won&#039;t even parse correctly, helping ensure safety.

Here, however, we&#039;ll use the shortcut &quot;dotted key&quot; syntax for referring to keys.
This is used in some API endpoints with less-structured requests or responses.
It&#039;s also more compact for our needs here.

In this format, &quot;settings.kubernetes.cluster-name&quot; refers to the same key as in the JSON `{&quot;settings&quot;: {&quot;kubernetes&quot;: {&quot;cluster-name&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}}}`.

RisingWave is a real-time event streaming platform designed to offer the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;simplest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;most cost-effective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; way to &lt;b&gt;process&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;analyze&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;manage&lt;/b&gt; real-time event data — with built-in support for the [Apache Iceberg™](https://iceberg.apache.org/) open table format. It provides both a Postgres-compatible [SQL interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) and a DataFrame-style [Python interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/python-sdk/intro).

RisingWave can &lt;b&gt;ingest&lt;/b&gt; millions of events per second, continuously &lt;b&gt;join and analyze&lt;/b&gt; live streams with historical data, &lt;b&gt;serve&lt;/b&gt; ad-hoc queries at low latency, and &lt;b&gt;manage&lt;/b&gt; data reliably in Apache Iceberg™ tables.

## Try it out in 60 seconds

Install RisingWave standalone mode:
```shell
curl -L https://risingwave.com/sh | sh
```

To learn about other installation options, such as using a Docker image, see the [quick start guide](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/quickstart).

## Unified platform for streaming data

RisingWave delivers a unified streaming data platform that combines **ultra-low-latency stream processing** and **Iceberg-native data management**.

### Streaming analytics
RisingWave integrates real-time stream processing and low-latency serving in a single system. It continuously ingests data from streaming and batch sources, performs incremental computations across streams and tables with end-to-end freshness under 100 ms. Materialized views can be served directly within RisingWave with 10–20 ms p99 query latency, or delivered to downstream systems.

### Iceberg-based lakehouse ingestion and management
RisingWave treats Apache Iceberg™ as a first-class citizen. It directly hosts and manages the Iceberg REST catalog, allowing users to create and operate Iceberg tables through a PostgreSQL-compatible interface. RisingWave supports two write modes: Merge-on-Read (MoR) and Copy-on-Write (CoW), to suit different ingestion and query patterns. It also provides built-in table maintenance capabilities, including compaction, small-file optimization, vacuum, and snapshot cleanup, ensuring efficient and consistent data management without external tools or pipelines.

## Key design decisions

RisingWave is designed to be easier to use and more cost-efficient:

### PostgreSQL compatibility

* **Seamless integration:** Connects via the PostgreSQL wire protocol, working with psql, JDBC, and any Postgres tool.
* **Expressive SQL:** Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data with a familiar SQL dialect.
* **No manual state tuning:** Eliminates complex state management configurations.

### S3 as primary storage

RisingWave stores tables, materialized views, and internal states of stream processing jobs in S3 (or equivalent object storage), providing:
- **High performance:** Optimized for complex queries, including joins and time windowing.
- **Fast recovery:** Restores from system failures within seconds.
- **[Dynamic scaling](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/k8s-cluster-scaling):** Instantly adjusts resources to handle workload spikes.

Beyond caching hot data in memory, RisingWave supports [**elastic disk cache**](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/disk-cache), a powerful performance optimization that uses local disks or EBS for efficient data caching. This minimizes access to S3, lowering processing latency and cutting S3 access costs.

### Apache Iceberg™ native support
RisingWave [**natively integrates with Apache Iceberg™**](https://docs.risingwave.com/iceberg/overview), enabling continuous ingestion of streaming data into Iceberg tables. It can also read directly from Iceberg, perform automatic compaction, and maintain table health over time. Since Iceberg is an open table format, results are accessible by other query engines — making storage not only cost-efficient, but interoperable by design.

## In what use cases does RisingWave excel?
RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Live dashboards**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Monitoring and alerting**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.
* **Iceberg-based lakehouses**: Power real-time lakehouse architectures where streaming data is continuously written to Apache Iceberg™ tables for unified analytics, governance, and long-term retention in open formats.

### Docker

```shell
model=Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.8 --model-id $model
```

And then you can make requests like

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/embed \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{&quot;inputs&quot;:&quot;What is Deep Learning?&quot;}&#039; \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039;
```

**Note:** To use GPUs, you need to install
the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).
NVIDIA drivers on your machine need to be compatible with CUDA version 12.2 or higher.

To see all options to serve your models:

```console
$ text-embeddings-router --help
Text Embedding Webserver

Usage: text-embeddings-router [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --model-id &lt;MODEL_ID&gt;
          The name of the model to load. Can be a MODEL_ID as listed on &lt;https://hf.co/models&gt; like `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`. Or it can be a local directory containing the necessary files as saved by `save_pretrained(...)` methods of transformers

          [env: MODEL_ID=]
          [default: BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5]

      --revision &lt;REVISION&gt;
          The actual revision of the model if you&#039;re referring to a model on the hub. You can use a specific commit id or a branch like `refs/pr/2`

          [env: REVISION=]

      --tokenization-workers &lt;TOKENIZATION_WORKERS&gt;
          Optionally control the number of tokenizer workers used for payload tokenization, validation and truncation. Default to the number of CPU cores on the machine

          [env: TOKENIZATION_WORKERS=]

      --dtype &lt;DTYPE&gt;
          The dtype to be forced upon the model

          [env: DTYPE=]
          [possible values: float16, float32]

      --pooling &lt;POOLING&gt;
          Optionally control the pooling method for embedding models.

          If `pooling` is not set, the pooling configuration will be parsed from the model `1_Pooling/config.json` configuration.

          If `pooling` is set, it will override the model pooling configuration

          [env: POOLING=]

          Possible values:
          - cls:        Select the CLS token as embedding
          - mean:       Apply Mean pooling to the model embeddings
          - splade:     Apply SPLADE (Sparse Lexical and Expansion) to the model embeddings. This option is only available if the loaded model is a `ForMaskedLM` Transformer model
          - last-token: Select the last token as embedding

      --max-concurrent-requests &lt;MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS&gt;
          The maximum amount of concurrent requests for this particular deployment. Having a low limit will refuse clients requests instead of having them wait for too long and is usually good to handle backpressure correctly

          [env: MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=]
          [default: 512]

      --max-batch-tokens &lt;MAX_BATCH_TOKENS&gt;
          **IMPORTANT** This is one critical control to allow maximum usage of the available hardware.

          This represents the total amount of potential tokens within a batch.

          For `max_batch_tokens=1000`, you could fit `10` queries of `total_tokens=100` or a single query of `1000` tokens.

          Overall this number should be the largest possible until the model is compute bound. Since the actual memory overhead depends on the model implementation, text-embeddings-inference cannot infer this number automatically.

          [env: MAX_BATCH_TOKENS=]
          [default: 16384]

      --max-batch-requests &lt;MAX_BATCH_REQUESTS&gt;
          Optionally control the maximum number of individual requests in a batch

          [env: MAX_BATCH_REQUESTS=]

      --max-client-batch-size &lt;MAX_CLIENT_BATCH_SIZE&gt;
          Control the maximum number of inputs that a client can send in a single request

          [env: MAX_CLIENT_BATCH_SIZE=]
          [default: 32]

      --auto-truncate
          Automatically truncate inputs that are longer than the maximum supported size

          Unused for gRPC servers

          [env: AUTO_TRUNCATE=]

      --default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;
          The name of the prompt that should be used by default for encoding. If not set, no prompt will be applied.

          Must be a key in the `sentence-transformers` configuration `prompts` dictionary.

          For example if ``default_prompt_name`` is &quot;query&quot; and the ``prompts`` is {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;query: &quot;, ...}, then the sentence &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot; will be encoded as &quot;query: What is the capital of France?&quot; because the prompt text will be prepended before any text to encode.

          The argument &#039;--default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;&#039; cannot be used with &#039;--default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;`

          [env: DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME=]

      --default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;
          The prompt that should be used by default for encoding. If not set, no prompt will be applied.

          For example if ``default_prompt`` is &quot;query: &quot; then the sentence &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot; will be encoded as &quot;query: What is the capital of France?&quot; because the prompt text will be prepended before any text to encode.

          The argument &#039;--default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;&#039; cannot be used with &#039;--default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;`

          [env: DEFAULT_PROMPT=]

      --dense-path &lt;DENSE_PATH&gt;
          Optionally, define the path to the Dense module required for some embedding models.

          Some embedding models require an extra `Dense` module which contains a single Linear layer and an activation function. By default, those `Dense` modules are stored under the `2_Dense` directory, but there might be cases where different `Dense` modules are provided, to convert the pooled embeddings into different dimensions, available as `2_Dense_&lt;dims&gt;` e.g. https://huggingface.co/NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5.

          Note that this argument is optional, only required to be set if the path to the `Dense` module is other than `2_Dense`. And it also applies when leveraging the `candle` backend.

          [env: DENSE_PATH=]
          [default: 2_Dense]

      --hf-token &lt;HF_TOKEN&gt;
          Your Hugging Face Hub token

          [env: HF_TOKEN=]

      --hostname &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;
          The IP address to listen on

          [env: HOSTNAME=]
          [default: 0.0.0.0]

      -p, --port &lt;PORT&gt;
          The port to listen on

          [env: PORT=]
          [default: 3000]

      --uds-path &lt;UDS_PATH&gt;
          The name of the unix socket some text-embeddings-inference backends will use as they communicate internally with gRPC

          [env: UDS_PATH=]
          [default: /tmp/text-embeddings-inference-server]

      --huggingface-hub-cache &lt;HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE&gt;
          The location of the huggingface hub cache. Used to override the location if you want to provide a mounted disk for instance

          [env: HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=]

      --payload-limit &lt;PAYLOAD_LIMIT&gt;
          Payload size limit in bytes

          Default is 2MB

          [env: PAYLOAD_LIMIT=]
          [default: 2000000]

      --api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;
          Set an api key for request authorization.

          By default the server responds to every request. With an api key set, the requests must have the Authorization header set with the api key as Bearer token.

          [env: API_KEY=]

      --json-output
          Outputs the logs in JSON format (useful for telemetry)

          [env: JSON_OUTPUT=]

      --disable-spans
          [env: DISABLE_SPANS=]

      --otlp-endpoint &lt;OTLP_ENDPOINT&gt;
          The grpc endpoint for opentelemetry. Telemetry is sent to this endpoint as OTLP over gRPC. e.g. `http://localhost:4317`

          [env: OTLP_ENDPOINT=]

      --otlp-service-name &lt;OTLP_SERVICE_NAME&gt;
          The service name for opentelemetry. e.g. `text-embeddings-inference.server`

          [env: OTLP_SERVICE_NAME=]
          [default: text-embeddings-inference.server]

      --prometheus-port &lt;PROMETHEUS_PORT&gt;
          The Prometheus port to listen on

          [env: PROMETHEUS_PORT=]
          [default: 9000]

      --cors-allow-origin &lt;CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN&gt;
          Unused for gRPC servers

          [env: CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with &#039;-h&#039;)

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

### Docker Images

Text Embeddings Inference ships with multiple Docker images that you can use to target a specific backend:

| Architecture                        | Image                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU                                 | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:cpu-1.8                   |
| Volta                               | NOT SUPPORTED                                                           |
| Turing (T4, RTX 2000 series, ...)   | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:turing-1.8 (experimental) |
| Ampere 80 (A100, A30)               | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.8                       |
| Ampere 86 (A10, A40, ...)           | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:86-1.8                    |
| Ada Lovelace (RTX 4000 series, ...) | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:89-1.8                    |
| Hopper (H100)                       | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:hopper-1.8 (experimental) |

**Warning**: Flash Attention is turned off by default for the Turing image as it suffers from precision issues.
You can turn Flash Attention v1 ON by using the `USE_FLASH_ATTENTION=True` environment variable.

### API documentation

You can consult the OpenAPI documentation of the `text-embeddings-inference` REST API using the `/docs` route.
The Swagger UI is also available
at: [https://huggingface.github.io/text-embeddings-inference](https://huggingface.github.io/text-embeddings-inference).

### Using a private or gated model

You have the option to utilize the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable for configuring the token employed by
`text-embeddings-inference`. This allows you to gain access to protected resources.

For example:

1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Copy your CLI READ token
3. Export `HF_TOKEN=&lt;your CLI READ token&gt;`

or with Docker:

```shell
model=&lt;your private model&gt;
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run
token=&lt;your CLI READ token&gt;

docker run --gpus all -e HF_TOKEN=$token -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.8 --model-id $model
```

### Air gapped deployment

To deploy Text Embeddings Inference in an air-gapped environment, first download the weights and then mount them inside
the container using a volume.

For example:

```shell
# (Optional) create a `models` directory
mkdir models
cd models

# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B

# Set the models directory as the volume path
volume=$PWD

# Mount the models directory inside the container with a volume and set the model ID
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.8 --model-id /data/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
```

### Using Re-rankers models

`text-embeddings-inference` v0.4.0 added support for CamemBERT, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, and GTE Sequence Classification models.
Re-rankers models are Sequence Classification cross-encoders models with a single class that scores the similarity
between a query and a text.

See [this blogpost](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/boosting-rag-picking-the-best-embedding-reranker-models-42d079022e83) by
the LlamaIndex team to understand how you can use re-rankers models in your RAG pipeline to improve
downstream performance.

```shell
model=BAAI/bge-reranker-large
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.8 --model-id $model
```

And then you can rank the similarity between a query and a list of texts with:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/rerank \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

See the [installation documentation](docs/install).

## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,
this repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,
the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the
fellowship, this separation, the RFC process
[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,
namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history

Wry is a cross-platform WebView rendering library.

The webview requires a running event loop and a window type that implements [`HasWindowHandle`],
or a gtk container widget if you need to support X11 and Wayland.
You can use a windowing library like [`tao`] or [`winit`].

### Examples

This example leverages the [`HasWindowHandle`] and supports Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux (X11 Only).
See the following example using [`winit`]:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct App {
  window: Option&lt;Window&gt;,
  webview: Option&lt;wry::WebView&gt;,
}

impl ApplicationHandler for App {
  fn resumed(&amp;mut self, event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop) {
    let window = event_loop.create_window(Window::default_attributes()).unwrap();
    let webview = WebViewBuilder::new()
      .with_url(&quot;https://tauri.app&quot;)
      .build(&amp;window)
      .unwrap();

    self.window = Some(window);
    self.webview = Some(webview);
  }

  fn window_event(&amp;mut self, _event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop, _window_id: WindowId, event: WindowEvent) {}
}

let event_loop = EventLoop::new().unwrap();
let mut app = App::default();
event_loop.run_app(&amp;mut app).unwrap();
```

If you also want to support Wayland too, then we recommend you use [`WebViewBuilderExtUnix::new_gtk`] on Linux.
See the following example using [`tao`]:

```rust
let event_loop = EventLoop::new();
let window = WindowBuilder::new().build(&amp;event_loop).unwrap();

let builder = WebViewBuilder::new().with_url(&quot;https://tauri.app&quot;);

#[cfg(not(target_os = &quot;linux&quot;))]
let webview = builder.build(&amp;window).unwrap();
#[cfg(target_os = &quot;linux&quot;)]
let webview = builder.build_gtk(window.gtk_window()).unwrap();
```

### Child webviews

You can use [`WebView::new_as_child`] or [`WebViewBuilder::new_as_child`] to create the webview as a child inside another window. This is supported on
macOS, Windows and Linux (X11 Only).

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct App {
  window: Option&lt;Window&gt;,
  webview: Option&lt;wry::WebView&gt;,
}

impl ApplicationHandler for App {
  fn resumed(&amp;mut self, event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop) {
    let window = event_loop.create_window(Window::default_attributes()).unwrap();
    let webview = WebViewBuilder::new()
      .with_url(&quot;https://tauri.app&quot;)
      .with_bounds(Rect {
        position: LogicalPosition::new(100, 100).into(),
        size: LogicalSize::new(200, 200).into(),
      })
      .build_as_child(&amp;window)
      .unwrap();

    self.window = Some(window);
    self.webview = Some(webview);
  }

  fn window_event(&amp;mut self, _event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop, _window_id: WindowId, event: WindowEvent) {}
}

let event_loop = EventLoop::new().unwrap();
let mut app = App::default();
event_loop.run_app(&amp;mut app).unwrap();
```

If you want to support X11 and Wayland at the same time, we recommend using
[`WebViewExtUnix::new_gtk`] or [`WebViewBuilderExtUnix::new_gtk`] with [`gtk::Fixed`].

```rust
let event_loop = EventLoop::new();
let window = WindowBuilder::new().build(&amp;event_loop).unwrap();

let builder = WebViewBuilder::new()
  .with_url(&quot;https://tauri.app&quot;)
  .with_bounds(Rect {
    position: LogicalPosition::new(100, 100).into(),
    size: LogicalSize::new(200, 200).into(),
  });

#[cfg(not(target_os = &quot;linux&quot;))]
let webview = builder.build_as_child(&amp;window).unwrap();
#[cfg(target_os = &quot;linux&quot;)]
let webview = {
  # use gtk::prelude::*;
  let vbox = window.default_vbox().unwrap(); // tao adds a gtk::Box by default
  let fixed = gtk::Fixed::new();
  fixed.show_all();
  vbox.pack_start(&amp;fixed, true, true, 0);
  builder.build_gtk(&amp;fixed).unwrap()
};
```

### Platform Considerations

Here is the underlying web engine each platform uses, and some dependencies you might need to install.

#### Linux

[WebKitGTK](https://webkitgtk.org/) is used to provide webviews on Linux which requires GTK,
so if the windowing library doesn&#039;t support GTK (as in [`winit`])
you&#039;ll need to call [`gtk::init`] before creating the webview and then call [`gtk::main_iteration_do`] alongside
your windowing library event loop.

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct App {
  webview_window: Option&lt;(Window, WebView)&gt;,
}

impl ApplicationHandler for App {
  fn resumed(&amp;mut self, event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop) {
    let window = event_loop.create_window(Window::default_attributes()).unwrap();
    let webview = WebViewBuilder::new()
      .with_url(&quot;https://tauri.app&quot;)
      .build(&amp;window)
      .unwrap();

    self.webview_window = Some((window, webview));
  }

  fn window_event(&amp;mut self, _event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop, _window_id: WindowId, event: WindowEvent) {}

  // Advance GTK event loop &lt;!----- IMPORTANT
  fn about_to_wait(&amp;mut self, _event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop) {
    #[cfg(target_os = &quot;linux&quot;)]
    while gtk::events_pending() {
      gtk::main_iteration_do(false);
    }
  }
}

let event_loop = EventLoop::new().unwrap();
let mut app = App::default();
event_loop.run_app(&amp;mut app).unwrap();
```

##### Linux Dependencies

###### Arch Linux / Manjaro:

```bash
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1
```

###### Debian / Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
```

###### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install gtk3-devel webkit2gtk4.1-devel
```

###### Nix &amp; NixOS

```sh
nix-shell -p pkg-config webkitgtk_4_1
```

###### GUIX

```scheme
;; manifest.scm

(specifications-&gt;manifest
  &#039;(&quot;pkg-config&quot;                ; Helper tool used when compiling
    &quot;webkitgtk&quot;                 ; Web content engine fot GTK+
 ))
```

```bash
guix shell -m manifest.scm
```

#### macOS

WebKit is native on macOS so everything should be fine.

If you are cross-compiling for macOS using [osxcross](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross) and encounter a runtime panic like `Class with name WKWebViewConfiguration could not be found` it&#039;s possible that `WebKit.framework` has not been linked correctly, to fix this set the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-l framework=WebKit&quot; cargo build --target=x86_64-apple-darwin --release
```

#### Windows

WebView2 provided by Microsoft Edge Chromium is used. So wry supports Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11.

#### Android

In order for `wry` to be able to create webviews on Android, there are a few requirements that your application needs to uphold:

1. You need to set a few environment variables that will be used to generate the necessary kotlin
   files that you need to include in your Android application for wry to function properly.
   - `WRY_ANDROID_PACKAGE`: which is the reversed domain name of your android project and the app name in snake_case, for example, `com.wry.example.wry_app`
   - `WRY_ANDROID_LIBRARY`: for example, if your cargo project has a lib name `wry_app`, it will generate `libwry_app.so` so you set this env var to `wry_app`
   - `WRY_ANDROID_KOTLIN_FILES_OUT_DIR`: for example, `path/to/app/src/main/kotlin/com/wry/example`
2. Your main Android Activity needs to inherit `AppCompatActivity`, preferably it should use the generated `WryActivity` or inherit it.
3. Your Rust app needs to call `wry::android_setup` function to setup the necessary logic to be able to create webviews later on.
4. Your Rust app needs to call `wry::android_binding!` macro to setup the JNI functions that will be called by `WryActivity` and various other places.

It is recommended to use the [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao/latest/tao/) crate as it provides maximum compatibility with `wry`.

```rust
#[cfg(target_os = &quot;android&quot;)]
{
  tao::android_binding!(
      com_example,
      wry_app,
      WryActivity,
      wry::android_setup, // pass the wry::android_setup function to tao which will be invoked when the event loop is created
      _start_app
  );
  wry::android_binding!(com_example, ttt);
}
```

If this feels overwhelming, you can just use the preconfigured template from [`cargo-mobile2`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/cargo-mobile2).

For more information, check out [MOBILE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/blob/dev/MOBILE.md).

### Feature flags

Wry uses a set of feature flags to toggle several advanced features.

- `os-webview` (default): Enables the default WebView framework on the platform. This must be enabled
  for the crate to work. This feature was added in preparation of other ports like cef and servo.
- `protocol` (default): Enables [`WebViewBuilder::with_custom_protocol`] to define custom URL scheme for handling tasks like
  loading assets.
- `drag-drop` (default): Enables [`WebViewBuilder::with_drag_drop_handler`] to control the behavior when there are files
  interacting with the window.
- `devtools`: Enables devtools on release builds. Devtools are always enabled in debug builds.
  On **macOS**, enabling devtools, requires calling private APIs so you should not enable this flag in release
  build if your app needs to publish to App Store.
- `transparent`: Transparent background on **macOS** requires calling private functions.
  Avoid this in release build if your app needs to publish to App Store.
- `fullscreen`: Fullscreen video and other media on **macOS** requires calling private functions.
  Avoid this in release build if your app needs to publish to App Store.
- `linux-body`: Enables body support of custom protocol request on Linux. Requires
  WebKit2GTK v2.40 or above.
- `tracing`: enables [`tracing`] for `evaluate_script`, `ipc_handler`, and `custom_protocols`.

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));

## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies.
Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, …)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

#### Render-to-texture
You can also render your 3D scene to a texture and display it using [`ui.image(…)`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Ui.html#method.image). You first need to convert the native texture to an [`egui::TextureId`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/

## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
&gt; the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
&gt; We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |

**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.
Skipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.221.0a20250912` for September 12, 2025):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.221.0a20250912 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).

To programmatically fetch and list available versions:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP &#039;(?&lt;=&lt;a href=&quot;)[^&quot;]+(?=&quot;)&#039; | awk -F&#039;#&#039; &#039;{print $1}&#039; | sort
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; On Linux, confirm your glibc version with `ldd --version` and ensure it reports **2.35** or newer before installing binary wheels.

#### Branch updates

- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): Build and publish continuously with every merged commit.
- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): Build and publish daily whe

## What is it?

- Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html).
- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## Demo

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

[![demo](./docs/tapes/demo.gif)](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

See [demo transcript](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html).

## Quickstart

### Install mise

See [Getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for more options.

```sh-session
$ curl https://mise.run | sh
$ ~/.local/bin/mise --version
2025.10.19 macos-arm64 (a1b2d3e 2025-10-28)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@22 -- node -v
mise node@22.x.x ✓ installed
v22.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@22 go@1
$ node -v
v22.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

## GitHub Issues &amp; Discussions

Due to the volume of issue submissions mise received, using GitHub Issues became unsustainable for
the project. Instead, mise uses GitHub Discussions which provide a more community-centric platform
for communication and require less management on the part of the maintainers.

Please note the following discussion categories, which match how issues are often used:

- [Announcements](https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/categories/announcements)
- [Ideas](https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/categories/ideas): for feature requests, etc.
- [Troubleshooting &amp; Bug Reports](https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/categories/troubleshooting-and-bug-reports)

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## The Era of Multi-GPU, Multi-Node

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models are quickly outgrowing the memory and compute budget of any single GPU. Tensor-parallelism solves the capacity problem by spreading each layer across many GPUs—and sometimes many servers—but it creates a new one: how do you coordinate those shards, route requests, and share KV cache fast enough to feel like one accelerator? This orchestration gap is exactly what NVIDIA Dynamo is built to close.

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:

- **Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference** – Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.
- **Dynamic GPU scheduling** – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-aware request routing** – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated data transfer** – Reduces inference response time using NIXL.
- **KV cache offloading** – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput

Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.

# Installation

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/reference/support-matrix.md](docs/reference/support-matrix.md)

## 1. Initial setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install Python development headers

Backend engines require Python development headers for JIT compilation. Install them with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

### Install etcd and NATS (required)

To coordinate across a data center, Dynamo relies on etcd and NATS. To run Dynamo locally, these need to be available.

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs jetstream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup etcd &amp; NATS, you can also run:

```
# At the root of the repository:
# Edit deploy/docker-compose.yml to comment out &quot;runtime: nvidia&quot; of the dcgm-exporter service if the nvidia container runtime isn&#039;t deployed or to be used.
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 2. Select an engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, and trtllm. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Sanity check (optional)

Before trying out Dynamo, you can verify your system configuration and dependencies:

```bash
./deploy/sanity_check.py
```

This is a quick check for system resources, development tools, LLM frameworks, and Dynamo components.

### Running an LLM API server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server, a pre-processor (prompt templating and tokenization) and a router.
# Pass the TLS certificate and key paths to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
python -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 [--tls-cert-path cert.pem] [--tls-key-path key.pem]

# Start the SGLang engine, connecting to NATS and etcd to receive requests. You can run several of these,
# both for the same model and for multiple models. The frontend node will discover them.
python -m dynamo.sglang --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
```

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### Deploying Dynamo

- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](docs/kubernetes/README.md) to deploy on Kubernetes.
- Check out [Backends](components/backends) to deploy various workflow configurations (e.g. SGLang with router, vLLM with disaggregated serving, etc.)
- Run some [Examples](examples) to learn about building components in Dynamo and exploring various integrations.

### Benchmarking Dynamo

Dynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools to evaluate and optimize your deployments:

- **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** – Compare deployment topologies (aggregated vs. disaggregated vs. vanilla vLLM) using AIPerf
- **[SLA-Driven Dynamo Deployments](docs/planner/sla_planner_quickstart.md)** – Optimize your deployment to meet SLA requirements

# Engines

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic. To use any engine with Dynamo, NATS and etcd need to be installed, along with a Dynamo frontend (`python -m dynamo.frontend [--interactive]`).

## vLLM

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

vLLM attempts to allocate enough KV cache for the full context length at startup. If that does not fit in your available memory pass `--context-length &lt;value&gt;`.

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

## SGLang

```
# Install libnuma
apt install -y libnuma-dev

uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.sglang --help
```

You can pass any sglang flags directly to this worker, see https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/server_arguments.html . See there to use multiple GPUs.

## TensorRT-LLM

It is recommended to use [NGC PyTorch Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for running the TensorRT-LLM engine.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Ensure that you select a PyTorch container image version that matches the version of TensorRT-LLM you are using.
&gt; For example, if you are using `tensorrt-llm==1.1.0rc5`, use the PyTorch container image version `25.06`.
&gt; To find the correct PyTorch container version for your desired `tensorrt-llm` release, visit the [TensorRT-LLM Dockerfile.multi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.multi) on GitHub. Switch to the branch that matches your `tensorrt-llm` version, and look for the `BASE_TAG` line to identify the recommended PyTorch container tag.

&gt; [!Important]
&gt; Launch container with the following additional settings `--shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1`

### Install prerequisites

```
# Optional step: Only required for Blackwell and Grace Hopper
uv pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Required until the trtllm version is bumped to include this pinned dependency itself
uv pip install &quot;cuda-python&gt;=12,&lt;13&quot;

sudo apt-get -y install libopenmpi-dev
```

&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; You can learn more about these prequisites and known issues with TensorRT-LLM pip based installation [here](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html).

### After installing the pre-requisites above, install Dynamo

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[trtllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.trtllm --help
```

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

# Developing Locally

## 1. Install libraries

**Ubuntu:**

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
```

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```

If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.

## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python virtual env:

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don&#039;t have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install build tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install the wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e .
```

You should now be able to run `python -m dynamo.frontend`.

Remember that nats and etcd must be running (see earlier).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.

Warpgate is a smart &amp; fully transparent SSH, HTTPS, MySQL and PostgreSQL bastion host that doesn&#039;t require a client app or an SSH wrapper.

* Set it up in your DMZ, add user accounts and easily assign them to specific hosts and URLs within the network.
* Warpgate will record every session for you to view (live) and replay later through a built-in admin web UI.
* Not a jump host - forwards connection straight to the target in a way that&#039;s fully transparent to the client.
* Native 2FA and SSO support (TOTP &amp; OpenID Connect)
* Single binary with no dependencies.
* Written in 100% safe Rust.

## Getting started &amp; downloads

* See the [Getting started](https://warpgate.null.page/getting-started/) docs page (or [Getting started on Docker](https://warpgate.null.page/getting-started-on-docker/)).
* [Release / beta binaries](https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/releases)
* [Nightly builds](https://nightly.link/warp-tech/warpgate/workflows/build/main)

## Reporting security issues

Please use GitHub&#039;s [vulnerability reporting system](https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/security/policy).

## Project Status

The project is ready for production.

## How it works

Warpgate is a service that you deploy on the bastion/DMZ host, which will accept SSH, HTTPS, MySQL and PostgreSQL connections and provide an (optional) web admin UI.

Run `warpgate setup` to interactively generate a config file, including port bindings. See [Getting started](https://warpgate.null.page/getting-started/) for details.

It receives connections with specifically formatted credentials, authenticates the user locally, connects to the target itself, and then connects both parties together while (optionally) recording the session.

When connecting through HTTPS, Warpgate presents a selection of available targets, and will then proxy all traffic in a session to the selected target. You can switch between targets at any time.

You manage the target and user lists and assign them to each other through the admin UI, and the session history is stored in an SQLite database (default: in `/var/lib/warpgate`).

You can also use the admin web interface to view the live session list, review session recordings, logs and more.

## Contributing / building from source

* You&#039;ll need Rust, NodeJS and NPM
* Clone the repo
* [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) is used to run tasks - install it: `cargo install just`
* Install the admin UI deps: `just npm install`
* Build the frontend: `just npm run build`
* Build Warpgate: `cargo build` (optionally `--release`)

The binary is in `target/{debug|release}`.

### Tech stack

* Rust 🦀
  * HTTP: `poem-web`
  * Database: SQLite via `sea-orm` + `sqlx`
  * SSH: `russh`
* Typescript
  * Svelte
  * Bootstrap

### Backend API

* Warpgate admin and user facing APIs use autogenerated OpenAPI schemas and SDKs. To update the SDKs after changing the query/response structures, run `just openapi-all`.
