## About

### What is FHEVM?

**FHEVM** is the core framework of the *Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol*. It enables confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing encrypted data to be processed directly onchain.

FHEVM ensures both confidentiality and composability, with the following guarantees:
- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn&#039;t impact existing dApps.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Project structure
The directories of this repository are organized in the following way:

###### FHEVM Contracts

- **`gateway-contracts/`**: Smart contracts managing the gateway between on-chain and off-chain components.

- **`host-contracts/`**: Smart Contracts deployed on the host chain for orchestrating FHE workflows.

###### FHEVM Compute Engines

- **`coprocessor/`**: Rust-based coprocessor implementation for FHE operations.

- **`kms-connector/`**: Interface for integrating with Key Management Services (KMS) to handle encryption keys securely.

###### FHEVM Utilities
- **`charts/`**: Helm charts and deployment configurations for the stack.

- **`golden-container-images/`**: Docker golden images for Node.js and Rust environments used as base images by the stack.

- **`test-suite/`**: Integration with docker-compose and tests covering end-to-end FHEVM stack behavior.



  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
### Main features

- **Privacy by design:** Building decentralized apps with full privacy and confidentiality on Ethereum, leveraging FHE.
- **Solidity integration:** Write FHEVM contracts like any standard Solidity contract using Solidity. Compatible with existing toolchains — such as Hardhat and Foundry (*coming soon*).
- **Programmable privacy:**  Define exactly what data is encrypted and write the access control logic directly in your smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers.
- **Full range of operators:** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, ternary-if, boolean operations…. Consecutive FHE operations are not limited.
- **Security:** The underlying FHE crypto-scheme of FHEVM is quantum-resistant. Decryption is managed via a key management system (KMS) using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring security even if some parties are compromised or misbehaving.
- **Symbolic execution of FHE computations:** All FHE operations are executed symbolically on the host chain, significantly reducing execution time. The actual computations on encrypted data are offloaded asynchronously to our coprocessor, allowing for faster, efficient, and scalable processing.

_Learn more about FHEVM features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) and in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/fhevm-whitepaper.pdf)._
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Use cases

FHEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without the need to learn cryptography. Leveraging FHEVM, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFi, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Confidential transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.
- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils coreutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

Our key objectives include:
- Matching GNU&#039;s output (stdout and error code) exactly
- Better error messages
- Providing comprehensive internationalization support (UTF-8)
- Improved performances
- [Extensions](docs/src/extensions.md) when relevant (example: --progress)

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.

Use [weblate/rust-coreutils](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rust-coreutils/) to translate the Rust coreutils into your language.

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and GNU Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

🚀An efficient VPN

🚀一个简单、高效、能快速组建虚拟局域网的工具

### vnt-cli参数详解 [参数说明](https://github.com/vnt-dev/vnt/blob/main/vnt-cli/README.md)

### 快速开始：

1. 指定一个token，在多台设备上运行该程序，例如：
    ```shell
      # linux上
      root@DESKTOP-0BCHNIO:/opt# ./vnt-cli -k 123456
      # 在另一台linux上使用nohup后台运行
      root@izj6cemne76ykdzkataftfz vnt# nohup ./vnt-cli -k 123456 &amp;
      # windows上
      D:\vnt\bin_v1&gt;vnt-cli.exe -k 123456
    ```
2. 可以执行info命令查看当前设备的虚拟ip
   ```shell
    root@DESKTOP-0BCHNIO:/opt# ./vnt-cli --info
    Name: Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) [64-bit]
    Virtual ip: 10.26.0.2
    Virtual gateway: 10.26.0.1
    Virtual netmask: 255.255.255.0
    Connection status: Connected
    NAT type: Cone
    Relay server: 43.139.56.10:29871
    Public ips: 120.228.76.75
    Local ip: 172.25.165.58
    ```
3. 也可以执行list命令查看其他设备的虚拟ip
   ```shell
    root@DESKTOP-0BCHNIO:/opt# ./vnt-cli --list
    Name                                                       Virtual Ip      P2P/Relay      Rt      Status
    Windows 10.0.22621 (Windows 11 Professional) [64-bit]      10.26.0.3       p2p            2       Online
    CentOS 7.9.2009 (Core) [64-bit]                            10.26.0.4       p2p            35      Online
    ```
4. 最后可以用虚拟ip实现设备间相互访问

      &lt;img width=&quot;506&quot; alt=&quot;ssh&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vnt-dev/vnt/main/documents/img/ssh.jpg&quot;&gt;
5. 帮助，使用-h命令查看

### 使用须知

- token的作用是标识一个虚拟局域网，当使用公共服务器时，建议使用一个唯一值当token(比如uuid)，否则有可能连接到其他人创建的虚拟局域网中
- 默认使用公共服务器做注册和中继，目前的配置是2核4G 4Mbps，有需要再扩展~
- vnt-cli需要使用命令行运行
- Mac和Linux下需要加可执行权限(例如:chmod +x ./vnt-cli)
- 可以自己搭中继服务器([server](https://github.com/vnt-dev/vnts))

### 直接使用

[**下载release文件**](https://github.com/vnt-dev/vnt/releases)

[**帮助文档**](https://rustvnt.com)

### 自行编译

&lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt;点击展开&lt;/summary&gt;

前提条件:安装rust编译环境([install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/zh-CN/tools/install))

```
到项目根目录下执行 cargo build -p vnt-cli

也可按需编译，将得到更小的二进制文件，使用--no-default-features排除默认features

cargo build -p vnt-cli --no-default-features
```

### 常见问题

&lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt;展开&lt;/summary&gt;

#### 问题1: 设置网络地址失败

##### 可能原因:

vnt默认使用10.26.0.0/24网段，和本地网络适配器的ip冲突

##### 解决方法:

1. 方法一：找到冲突的IP，将其改成别的
2. 方法二：自建服务器，指定其他不会冲突的网段
3. 方法三：增加参数-d &lt;device-id&gt; ，设置不同的id会让服务端分配不同的IP，从而绕开有冲突的IP

#### 问题2: windows系统上wintun.dll加载失败

##### 可能原因：

没有下载wintun.dll 或者使用的wintun.dll有问题

##### 解决方法：

1. 下载最新版的wintun.dll [下载链接](https://www.wintun.net/builds/wintun-0.14.1.zip)
2. 解压后找到对应架构的目录,通常是amd64
3. 将对应的wintun.dll放到和vnt-cli同目录下（或者放到C盘Windows目录下）
4. 再次启动vnt-cli

#### 问题3: 丢包严重，或是不能正常组网通信

##### 可能原因：

某些宽带下(比如广电宽带)UDP丢包严重

##### 解决方法：

1. 使用TCP模式中继转发（vnt-cli增加--tcp参数）
2. 如果p2p后效果很差，可以选择禁用p2p（vnt-cli增加--use-channel relay 参数）

#### 问题4：重启后虚拟IP发生变化，或指定了IP不能启动

##### 可能原因：

设备重启后程序自动获取的id值改变，导致注册时重新分配了新的IP，或是IP冲突

##### 解决方法：

1. 命令行启动增加-d参数（使用配置文件启动则在配置文件中增加device_id参数），要保证每个设备的值都不一样，取值可以任意64位以内字符串

&lt;/details&gt;

[English] | [简体中文]


Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

([egui 的中文翻译文档 / chinese translation](https://github.com/Re-Ch-Love/egui-doc-cn/blob/main/README_zh-hans.md))


## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies:

* [`ab_glyph`](https://crates.io/crates/ab_glyph)
* [`ahash`](https://crates.io/crates/ahash)
* [`bitflags`](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags)
* [`nohash-hasher`](https://crates.io/crates/nohash-hasher)
* [`parking_lot`](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)

Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, …)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

oha is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application and show realtime tui inspired by [rakyll/hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey).

This program is written in Rust and powered by [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) and beautiful tui by [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui).

![demo](demo.gif)

# Installation

This program is built on stable Rust, with both `make` and `cmake` prerequisites to install via cargo.

    cargo install oha

You can optionally build oha against [native-tls](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls) instead of [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls).

    cargo install --no-default-features --features native-tls oha

You can enable VSOCK support by enabling `vsock` feature.

    cargo install --features vsock oha

You can enable experimental HTTP3 support by enabling the `http3` feature. This uses the [H3](https://github.com/hyperium/h3/r) library by the developers of Hyper.
It will remain experimental as long as H3 is experimental. It currently depends on using `rustls` for TLS.

## Download pre-built binary

You can download pre-built binary from [Release page](https://github.com/hatoo/oha/releases) for each version and from [Publish workflow](https://github.com/hatoo/oha/actions/workflows/release.yml) and [Publish PGO workflow](https://github.com/hatoo/oha/actions/workflows/release-pgo.yml) for each commit.

## On Arch Linux

    pacman -S oha

## On macOS (Homebrew)

    brew install oha

## On Windows (winget)

    winget install hatoo.oha

## On Debian ([Azlux&#039;s repository](http://packages.azlux.fr/))

    echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/azlux-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.azlux.fr/debian/ stable main&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azlux.list
    sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/azlux-archive-keyring.gpg https://azlux.fr/repo.gpg
    apt update
    apt install oha

## X-CMD (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL/GitBash)

You can install with [x-cmd](https://www.x-cmd.com).

```sh
x env use oha
```

## Containerized

You can also build and create a container image including oha

```sh
docker build -t hatoo/oha:latest .
```

Then you can use oha directly through the container

```sh
docker run --rm -it --network=host hatoo/oha:latest https://example.com:3000
```

## Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)

You can build `oha` with PGO by using the following commands:

```sh
bun run pgo.js
```

And the binary will be available at `target/[target-triple]/pgo/oha`.

# Platform

- Linux - Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 gnome-terminal
- Windows 10 - Tested on Windows Powershell
- MacOS - Tested on iTerm2

# Usage

`-q` option works different from [rakyll/hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey). It&#039;s set overall query per second instead of for each workers.

```sh
Ohayou(おはよう), HTTP load generator, inspired by rakyll/hey with tui animation.

Usage: oha [OPTIONS] &lt;URL&gt;

Arguments:
  &lt;URL&gt;  Target URL or file with multiple URLs.

Options:
  -n &lt;N_REQUESTS&gt;
          Number of requests to run. [default: 200]
  -c &lt;N_CONNECTIONS&gt;
          Number of connections to run concurrently. You may should increase limit to number of open files for larger `-c`. [default: 50]
  -p &lt;N_HTTP2_PARALLEL&gt;
          Number of parallel requests to send on HTTP/2. `oha` will run c * p concurrent workers in total. [default: 1]
  -z &lt;DURATION&gt;
          Duration of application to send requests. If duration is specified, n is ignored.
          On HTTP/1, When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are aborted and counted as &quot;aborted due to deadline&quot;
          You can change this behavior with `-w` option.
          Currently, on HTTP/2, When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are waited. `-w` option is ignored.
          Examples: -z 10s -z 3m.
  -w, --wait-ongoing-requests-after-deadline
          When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are waited
  -q &lt;QUERY_PER_SECOND&gt;
          Rate limit for all, in queries per second (QPS)
      --burst-delay &lt;BURST_DURATION&gt;
          Introduce delay between a predefined number of requests.
          Note: If qps is specified, burst will be ignored
      --burst-rate &lt;BURST_REQUESTS&gt;
          Rates of requests for burst. Default is 1
          Note: If qps is specified, burst will be ignored
      --rand-regex-url
          Generate URL by rand_regex crate but dot is disabled for each query e.g. http://127.0.0.1/[a-z][a-z][0-9]. Currently dynamic scheme, host and port with keep-alive do not work well. See https://docs.rs/rand_regex/latest/rand_regex/struct.Regex.html for details of syntax.

      --dump-urls &lt;DUMP_URLS&gt;
          Dump target Urls &lt;DUMP_URLS&gt; times to debug --rand-regex-url
      --latency-correction
          Correct latency to avoid coordinated omission problem. It&#039;s ignored if -q is not set.

# Performance

`oha` uses faster implementation when `--no-tui` option is set and both `-q` and `--burst-delay` are not set because it can avoid overhead to gather data realtime.

# Output

By default `oha` outputs a text summary of the results.

`oha` prints JSON summary output when `--output-format json` option is set.
The schema of JSON output is defined in [schema.json](./schema.json).

When `--output-format csv` is used result of each request is printed as a line of comma separated values.

# Tips

## Stress test in more realistic condition

`oha` uses default options inherited from [rakyll/hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) but you may need to change options to stress test in more realistic condition.

I suggest to run `oha` with following options.

```sh
oha &lt;-z or -n&gt; -c &lt;number of concurrent connections&gt; -q &lt;query per seconds&gt; --latency-correction --disable-keepalive &lt;target-address&gt;
```

- --disable-keepalive

    In real, user doesn&#039;t query same URL using [Keep-Alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive). You may want to run without `Keep-Alive`.
- --latency-correction

    You can avoid `Coordinated Omission Problem` by using `--latency-correction`.

## Burst feature

You can use `--burst-delay` along with `--burst-rate` option to introduce delay between a defined number of requests.

```sh
oha -n 10 --burst-delay 2s --burst-rate 4
```

In this particular scenario, every 2 seconds, 4 requests will be processed, and after 6s the total of 10 requests will be processed.
*NOTE: If you don&#039;t set `--burst-rate` option, the amount is default to 1*

## Dynamic url feature

You can use `--rand-regex-url` option to generate random url for each connection.

```sh
oha --rand-regex-url http://127.0.0.1/[a-z][a-z][0-9]
```

Each Urls are generated by [rand_regex](https://github.com/kennytm/rand_regex) crate but regex&#039;s dot is disabled since it&#039;s not useful for this purpose and it&#039;s very inconvenient if url&#039;s dots are interpreted as regex&#039;s dot.

Optionally you can set `--max-repeat` option to limit max repeat count for each regex. e.g http://127.0.0.1/[a-z]* with `--max-repeat 4` will generate url like http://127.0.0.1/[a-z]{0,4}

Currently dynamic scheme, host and port with keep-alive are not works well.

## URLs from file feature

You can use `--urls-from-file` to read the target URLs from a file. Each line of this file needs to contain one valid URL as in the example below.

```
http://domain.tld/foo/bar
http://domain.tld/assets/vendors-node_modules_highlight_js_lib_index_js-node_modules_tanstack_react-query_build_modern-3fdf40-591fb51c8a6e.js
http://domain.tld/images/test.png
http://domain.tld/foo/bar?q=test
http://domain.tld/foo
```

Such a file can for example be created from an access log to generate a more realistic load distribution over the different pages of a server. 

When this type of URL specification is used, every request goes to a random URL given in the file.

# What&#039;s Hurl?

Hurl is a command line tool that runs &lt;b&gt;HTTP requests&lt;/b&gt; defined in a simple &lt;b&gt;plain text format&lt;/b&gt;.

It can chain requests, capture values and evaluate queries on headers and body response. Hurl is very
versatile: it can be used for both &lt;b&gt;fetching data&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;testing HTTP&lt;/b&gt; sessions.

Hurl makes it easy to work with &lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt; content, &lt;b&gt;REST / SOAP / GraphQL&lt;/b&gt; APIs, or any other &lt;b&gt;XML / JSON&lt;/b&gt; based APIs. 

```hurl
# Go home and capture token
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Captures]
csrf_token: xpath &quot;string(//meta[@name=&#039;_csrf_token&#039;]/@content)&quot;


# Do login!
POST https://example.org/login
X-CSRF-TOKEN: {{csrf_token}}
[Form]
user: toto
password: 1234
HTTP 302
```

Chaining multiple requests is easy:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/health
GET https://example.org/api/step1
GET https://example.org/api/step2
GET https://example.org/api/step3
```

# Also an HTTP Test Tool

Hurl can run HTTP requests but can also be used to &lt;b&gt;test HTTP responses&lt;/b&gt;.
Different types of queries and predicates are supported, from [XPath] and [JSONPath] on body response,
to assert on status code and response headers.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://hurl.dev/player.html?id=starwars&amp;speed=3&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/img/poster-starwars.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Hurl Demo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


It is well adapted for &lt;b&gt;REST / JSON APIs&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;4568&quot;,
    &quot;evaluate&quot;: true
}
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
header &quot;X-Frame-Options&quot; == &quot;SAMEORIGIN&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.status&quot; == &quot;RUNNING&quot;    # Check the status code
jsonpath &quot;$.tests&quot; count == 25      # Check the number of items
jsonpath &quot;$.id&quot; matches /\d{4}/     # Check the format of the id
```

&lt;b&gt;HTML content&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
xpath &quot;normalize-space(//head/title)&quot; == &quot;Hello world!&quot;
```

&lt;b&gt;GraphQL&lt;/b&gt; 

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: &quot;1000&quot;) {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
HTTP 200
~~~

and even &lt;b&gt;SOAP APIs&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
POST https://example.org/InStock
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
SOAPAction: &quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot; xmlns:m=&quot;https://example.org&quot;&gt;
  &lt;soap:Header&gt;&lt;/soap:Header&gt;
  &lt;soap:Body&gt;
    &lt;m:GetStockPrice&gt;
      &lt;m:StockName&gt;GOOG&lt;/m:StockName&gt;
    &lt;/m:GetStockPrice&gt;
  &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
HTTP 200
```

Hurl can also be used to test the &lt;b&gt;performance&lt;/b&gt; of HTTP endpoints

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/v1/pets
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
duration &lt; 1000  # Duration in ms
```

And check response bytes

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
sha256 == hex,039058c6f2c0cb492c533b0a4d14ef77cc0f78abccced5287d84a1a2011cfb81;
```

Finally, Hurl is easy to &lt;b&gt;integrate in CI/CD&lt;/b&gt;, with text, JUnit, TAP and HTML reports

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: light)&quot; srcset=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-light.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-dark.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-light.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; alt=&quot;HTML report&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

# Why Hurl?

&lt;ul class=&quot;showcase-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Text Format:&lt;/b&gt; for both devops and developers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast CLI:&lt;/b&gt; a command line for local dev and continuous integration&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single Binary:&lt;/b&gt; easy to install, with no runtime required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

# Powered by curl

Hurl is a lightweight binary written in [Rust]. Under the hood, Hurl HTTP engine is
powered by [libcurl], one of the most powerful and reliable file transfer libraries.
With its text file format, Hurl adds syntactic sugar to run and test HTTP requests,
but it&#039;s still the [curl] that we love: __fast__, __efficient__ and __IPv6 / HTTP/3 ready__.

# Feedbacks

# Samples

To run a sample, edit a file with the sample content, and run Hurl:

```shell
$ vi sample.hurl

GET https://example.org

$ hurl sample.hurl
```

By default, Hurl behaves like [curl] and outputs the last HTTP response&#039;s [entry]. To have a test
oriented output, you can use [`--test` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --test sample.hurl
```

A particular response can be saved with [`[Options] section`](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#options):

```hurl
GET https://example.ord/cats/123
[Options]
output: cat123.txt    # use - to output to stdout
HTTP 200

GET https://example.ord/dogs/567
HTTP 200
```

Finally, Hurl can take files as input, or directories. In the latter case, Hurl will search files with `.hurl` extension recursively.

```shell
$ hurl --test integration/*.hurl
$ hurl --test .
```

You can check [Hurl tests suite] for more samples.

## Getting Data

A simple GET:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
```

Requests can be chained:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/a
GET https://example.org/b
HEAD https://example.org/c
GET https://example.org/c
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#method)

### HTTP Headers

A simple GET with headers:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#headers)

### Query Params

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news
[Query]
order: newest
search: something to search
count: 100
```

Or:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news?order=newest&amp;search=something%20to%20search&amp;count=100
```

&gt; With `[Query]` section, params don&#039;t need to be URL escaped.

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#query-parameters)

### Basic Authentication

```hurl
GET https://example.org/protected
[BasicAuth]
bob: secret
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#basic-authentication)

This is equivalent to construct the request with a [Authorization] header:

```hurl
# Authorization header value can be computed with `echo -n &#039;bob:secret&#039; | base64`
GET https://example.org/protected
Authorization: Basic Ym9iOnNlY3JldA== 
```

Basic authentication section allows per request authentication. If you want to add basic authentication to all the
requests of a Hurl file you could use [`-u/--user` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --user bob:secret login.hurl
```

[`--user`] option can also be set per request:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/login
[Options]
user: bob:secret
HTTP 200

GET https://example.org/login
[Options]
user: alice:secret
HTTP 200
```

### Passing Data between Requests 

[Captures] can be used to pass data from one request to another:

```hurl
POST https://sample.org/orders
HTTP 201
[Captures]
order_id: jsonpath &quot;$.order.id&quot;

GET https://sample.org/orders/{{order_id}}
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/capturing-response.html)

## Sending Data

### Sending HTML Form Data

```hurl
POST https://example.org/contact
[Form]
default: false
token: {{token}}
email: john.doe@rookie.org
number: 33611223344
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#form-parameters)

### Sending Multipart Form Data

```hurl
POST https://example.org/upload
[Multipart]
field1: value1
field2: file,example.txt;
# One can specify the file content type:
field3: file,example.zip; application/zip
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multipart-form-data)

Multipart forms can also be sent with a [multiline string body]:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=&quot;boundary&quot;
```
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;key1&quot;

value1
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;upload1&quot;; filename=&quot;data.txt&quot;
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello World!
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;upload2&quot;; filename=&quot;data.html&quot;
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;div&gt;Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;
--boundary--
```
~~~

In that case, files have to be inlined in the Hurl file.

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multiline-string-body)

### Posting a JSON Body

With an inline JSON:

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;456&quot;,
    &quot;evaluate&quot;: true
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#json-body)

With a local file:

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
Content-Type: application/json
file,data.json;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#file-body)

### Templating a JSON Body

```hurl
PUT https://example.org/api/hits
Content-Type: application/json
{
    &quot;key0&quot;: &quot;{{a_string}}&quot;,
    &quot;key1&quot;: {{a_bool}},
    &quot;key2&quot;: {{a_null}},
    &quot;key3&quot;: {{a_number}}
}
```

Variables can be initialized via command line:

```shell
$ hurl --variable a_string=apple \
       --variable a_bool=true \
       --variable a_null=null \
       --variable a_number=42 \
       test.hurl
```

Resulting in a PUT request with the following JSON body:

```
{
    &quot;key0&quot;: &quot;apple&quot;,
    &quot;key1&quot;: true,
    &quot;key2&quot;: null,
    &quot;key3&quot;: 42
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/templates.html)

### Templating a XML Body

Using templates with [XML body] is not currently supported in Hurl. You can use templates in
[XML multiline string body] with variables to send a variable XML body:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/echo/post/xml
```xml
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;Request&gt;
    &lt;Login&gt;{{login}}&lt;/Login&gt;
    &lt;Password&gt;{{password}}&lt;/Password&gt;
&lt;/Request&gt;
```
~~~

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multiline-string-body)

### Using GraphQL Query

A simple GraphQL query:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/starwars/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: &quot;1000&quot;) {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
~~~

A GraphQL query with variables:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/starwars/graphql
```graphql
query Hero($episode: Episode, $withFriends: Boolean!) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends @include(if: $withFriends) {
      name
    }
  }
}

variables {
  &quot;episode&quot;: &quot;JEDI&quot;,
  &quot;withFriends&quot;: false
}
```
~~~

GraphQL queries can also use [Hurl templates].

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#graphql-body)

### Using Dynamic Datas

[Functions] like `newUuid` and `newDate` can be used in templates to create dynamic datas:


A file that creates a dynamic email (i.e `0531f78f-7f87-44be-a7f2-969a1c4e6d97@test.com`):

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/foo
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;,
  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;{{newUuid}}@test.com&quot;
}
```

A file that creates a dynamic query parameter (i.e `2024-12-02T10:35:44.461731Z`):

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/foo
[Query]
date: {{newDate}}
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/templates.html#functions)

## Testing Response

Responses are optional, everything after `HTTP` is part of the response asserts.

```hurl
# A request with (almost) no check:
GET https://foo.com

# A status code check:
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200

# A test on response body
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath &quot;$.state&quot; == &quot;running&quot;
```

### Testing Status Code

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order/435
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#version-status)

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order/435
# Testing status code is in a 200-300 range
HTTP *
[Asserts]
status &gt;= 200
status &lt; 300
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#status-assert)

### Testing Response Headers

Use implicit response asserts to test header values:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#headers)


Or use explicit response asserts with [predicates]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 302
[Asserts]
header &quot;Location&quot; contains &quot;www.example.net&quot;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#header-assert)

Implicit and explicit asserts can be combined:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
[Asserts]
header &quot;Location&quot; contains &quot;www.example.net&quot;
```

### Testing REST APIs

Asserting JSON body response (node values, collection count etc...) with [JSONPath]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order
screencapability: low
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath &quot;$.validated&quot; == true
jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.firstName&quot; == &quot;Franck&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.lastName&quot; == &quot;Herbert&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.hasDevice&quot; == false
jsonpath &quot;$.links&quot; count == 12
jsonpath &quot;$.state&quot; != null
jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches &quot;^order-\\d{8}$&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches /^order-\d{8}$/  # Alternative syntax with regex literal
jsonpath &quot;$.id&quot; matches /(?i)[a-z]*/        # See syntax for flags &lt;https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#grouping-and-flags&gt;
jsonpath &quot;$.created&quot; isIsoDate
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#jsonpath-assert)

### Testing HTML Response

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
[Asserts]
xpath &quot;string(/html/head/title)&quot; contains &quot;Example&quot; # Check title
xpath &quot;count(//p)&quot; == 2  # Check the number of p
xpath &quot;//p&quot; count == 2  # Similar assert for p
xpath &quot;boolean(count(//h2))&quot; == false  # Check there is no h2  
xpath &quot;//h2&quot; not exists  # Similar assert for h2
xpath &quot;string(//div[1])&quot; matches /Hello.*/
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#xpath-assert)

### Testing Set-Cookie Attributes

```hurl
GET https://example.org/home
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID&quot; == &quot;8400BAFE2F66443613DC38AE3D9D6239&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Value]&quot; == &quot;8400BAFE2F66443613DC38AE3D9D6239&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Expires]&quot; contains &quot;Wed, 13 Jan 2021&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Secure]&quot; exists
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[HttpOnly]&quot; exists
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[SameSite]&quot; == &quot;Lax&quot;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#cookie-assert)

### Testing Bytes Content

Check the SHA-256 response body hash:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
sha256 == hex,039058c6f2c0cb492c533b0a4d14ef77cc0f78abccced5287d84a1a2011cfb81;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#sha-256-assert)

### SSL Certificate

Check the properties of a SSL certificate:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
certificate &quot;Subject&quot; == &quot;CN=example.org&quot;
certificate &quot;Issuer&quot; == &quot;C=US, O=Let&#039;s Encrypt, CN=R3&quot;
certificate &quot;Expire-Date&quot; daysAfterNow &gt; 15
certificate &quot;Serial-Number&quot; matches /[\da-f]+/
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#ssl-certificate-assert)

### Checking Full Body

Use implicit body to test an exact JSON body match:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/cats/123
HTTP 200
{
  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Purrsloud&quot;,
  &quot;species&quot; : &quot;Cat&quot;,
  &quot;favFoods&quot; : [&quot;wet food&quot;, &quot;dry food&quot;, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; food&quot;],
  &quot;birthYear&quot; : 2016,
  &quot;photo&quot; : &quot;https://learnwebcode.github.io/json-example/images/cat-2.jpg&quot;
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#json-body)

[Ratatui][Ratatui Website] (_ˌræ.təˈtu.i_) is a Rust crate for cooking up terminal user interfaces
(TUIs). It provides a simple and flexible way to create text-based user interfaces in the terminal,
which can be used for command-line applications, dashboards, and other interactive console programs.

## Quickstart

Ratatui has [templates] available to help you get started quickly. You can use the
[`cargo-generate`] command to create a new project with Ratatui:

```shell
cargo install --locked cargo-generate
cargo generate ratatui/templates
```

Selecting the Hello World template produces the following application:

```rust
use color_eyre::Result;
use crossterm::event::{self, Event};
use ratatui::{DefaultTerminal, Frame};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    color_eyre::install()?;
    let terminal = ratatui::init();
    let result = run(terminal);
    ratatui::restore();
    result
}

fn run(mut terminal: DefaultTerminal) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    loop {
        terminal.draw(render)?;
        if matches!(event::read()?, Event::Key(_)) {
            break Ok(());
        }
    }
}

fn render(frame: &amp;mut Frame) {
    frame.render_widget(&quot;hello world&quot;, frame.area());
}
```

## Acknowledgements

Ratatui was forked from the [tui-rs] crate in 2023 in order to continue its development. None of
this could be possible without [Florian Dehau] who originally created [tui-rs] which inspired many
Rust TUIs.

Special thanks to [Pavel Fomchenkov] for his work in designing an awesome logo for the Ratatui
project and organization.

  &lt;i&gt;Linting the CPython codebase from scratch.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- ⚡️ 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- 🐍 Installable via `pip`
- 🛠️ `pyproject.toml` support
- 🤝 Python 3.13 compatibility
- ⚖️ Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- 📏 Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ⌨️ First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors) for [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028), lead
developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

```

You can also install Ruff via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruff), [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ruff),
and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.12.12
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code
quality tools, including:

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

uv is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

you get involved in the project. See the
[contributing guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## FAQ

#### How do you pronounce uv?

It&#039;s pronounced as &quot;you - vee&quot; ([`/juː viː/`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key))

#### How should I stylize uv?

Just &quot;uv&quot;, please. See the [style guide](./STYLE.md#styling-uv) for details.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

# Leptos

```rust
use leptos::*;

#[component]
pub fn SimpleCounter(initial_value: i32) -&gt; impl IntoView {
    // create a reactive signal with the initial value
    let (value, set_value) = signal(initial_value);

    // create event handlers for our buttons
    // note that `value` and `set_value` are `Copy`, so it&#039;s super easy to move them into closures
    let clear = move |_| set_value(0);
    let decrement = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value -= 1);
    let increment = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value += 1);

    // create user interfaces with the declarative `view!` macro
    view! {
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;button on:click=clear&gt;Clear&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;button on:click=decrement&gt;-1&lt;/button&gt;
            // text nodes can be quoted or unquoted
            &lt;span&gt;&quot;Value: &quot; {value} &quot;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;button on:click=increment&gt;+1&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    }
}

// we also support a builder syntax rather than the JSX-like `view` macro
#[component]
pub fn SimpleCounterWithBuilder(initial_value: i32) -&gt; impl IntoView {
    use leptos::html::*;

    let (value, set_value) = signal(initial_value);
    let clear = move |_| set_value(0);
    let decrement = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value -= 1);
    let increment = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value += 1);

    // the `view` macro above expands to this builder syntax
    div().child((
        button().on(ev::click, clear).child(&quot;Clear&quot;),
        button().on(ev::click, decrement).child(&quot;-1&quot;),
        span().child((&quot;Value: &quot;, value, &quot;!&quot;)),
        button().on(ev::click, increment).child(&quot;+1&quot;)
    ))
}

// Easy to use with Trunk (trunkrs.dev) or with a simple wasm-bindgen setup
pub fn main() {
    mount_to_body(|| view! {
        &lt;SimpleCounter initial_value=3 /&gt;
    })
}
```

## About the Framework

Leptos is a full-stack, isomorphic Rust web framework leveraging fine-grained reactivity to build declarative user interfaces.

## What does that mean?

- **Full-stack**: Leptos can be used to build apps that run in the browser (client-side rendering), on the server (server-side rendering), or by rendering HTML on the server and then adding interactivity in the browser (server-side rendering with hydration). This includes support for HTTP streaming of both data ([`Resource`s](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/struct.Resource.html)) and HTML (out-of-order or in-order streaming of [`&lt;Suspense/&gt;`](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/fn.Suspense.html) components.)
- **Isomorphic**: Leptos provides primitives to write isomorphic [server functions](https://docs.rs/leptos_server/0.2.5/leptos_server/index.html), i.e., functions that can be called with the “same shape” on the client or server, but only run on the server. This means you can write your server-only logic (database requests, authentication etc.) alongside the client-side components that will consume it, and call server functions as if they were running in the browser, without needing to create and maintain a separate REST or other API.
- **Web**: Leptos is built on the Web platform and Web standards. The [router](https://docs.rs/leptos_router/latest/leptos_router/) is designed to use Web fundamentals (like links and forms) and build on top of them rather than trying to replace them.
- **Framework**: Leptos provides most of what you need to build a modern web app: a reactive system, templating library, and a router that works on both the server and client side.
- **Fine-grained reactivity**: The entire framework is built from reactive primitives. This allows for extremely performant code with minimal overhead: when a reactive signal’s value changes, it can update a single text node, toggle a single class, or remove an element from the DOM without any other code running. (So, no virtual DOM overhead!)
- **Declarative**: Tell Leptos how you want the page to look, and let the framework tell the browser how to do it.

## `cargo-leptos`

[`cargo-leptos`](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos) is a build tool that&#039;s designed to make it easy to build apps that run on both the client and the server, with seamless integration. The best way to get started with a real Leptos project right now is to use `cargo-leptos` and our starter templates for [Actix](https://github.com/leptos-rs/start) or [Axum](https://github.com/leptos-rs/start-axum).

```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos
cargo leptos new --git https://github.com/leptos-rs/start-axum
cd [your project name]
cargo leptos watch
```

## FAQs

### What’s up with the name?

_Leptos_ (λεπτός) is an ancient Greek word meaning “thin, light, refined, fine-grained.” To me, a classicist and not a dog owner, it evokes the lightweight reactive system that powers the framework. I&#039;ve since learned the same word is at the root of the medical term “leptospirosis,” a blood infection that affects humans and animals... My bad. No dogs were harmed in the creation of this framework.

### Is it production ready?

People usually mean one of three things by this question.

1. **Are the APIs stable?** i.e., will I have to rewrite my whole app from Leptos 0.1 to 0.2 to 0.3 to 0.4, or can I write it now and benefit from new features and updates as new versions come?

The APIs are basically settled. We’re adding new features, but we’re very happy with where the type system and patterns have landed. I would not expect major breaking changes to your code to adapt to future releases, in terms of architecture.

2. **Are there bugs?**

Yes, I’m sure there are. You can see from the state of our issue tracker over time that there aren’t that _many_ bugs and they’re usually resolved pretty quickly. But for sure, there may be moments where you encounter something that requires a fix at the framework level, which may not be immediately resolved.

3. **Am I a consumer or a contributor?**

This may be the big one: “production ready” implies a certain orientation to a library: that you can basically use it, without any special knowledge of its internals or ability to contribute. Everyone has this at some level in their stack: for example I (@gbj) don’t have the capacity or knowledge to contribute to something like `wasm-bindgen` at this point: I simply rely on it to work.

There are several people in the community using Leptos right now for many websites at work, who have also become significant contributors. There may be missing features that you need, and you may end up building them! But, if you&#039;re willing to contribute a few missing pieces along the way, the framework is most definitely usable for production applications, especially given the ecosystem of libraries that have sprung up around it.

### Can I use this for native GUI?

Sure! Obviously the `view` macro is for generating DOM nodes but you can use the reactive system to drive any native GUI toolkit that uses the same kind of object-oriented, event-callback-based framework as the DOM pretty easily. The principles are the same:

- Use signals, derived signals, and memos to create your reactive system
- Create GUI widgets
- Use event listeners to update signals
- Create effects to update the UI

The 0.7 update originally set out to create a &quot;generic rendering&quot; approach that would allow us to reuse most of the same view logic to do all of the above. Unfortunately, this has had to be shelved for now due to difficulties encountered by the Rust compiler when building larger-scale applications with the number of generics spread throughout the codebase that this required. It&#039;s an approach I&#039;m looking forward to exploring again in the future; feel free to reach out if you&#039;re interested in this kind of work.

### How is this different from Yew?

Yew is the most-used library for Rust web UI development, but there are several differences between Yew and Leptos, in philosophy, approach, and performance.

- **VDOM vs. fine-grained:** Yew is built on the virtual DOM (VDOM) model: state changes cause components to re-render, generating a new virtual DOM tree. Yew diffs this against the previous VDOM, and applies those patches to the actual DOM. Component functions rerun whenever state changes. Leptos takes an entirely different approach. Components run once, creating (and returning) actual DOM nodes and setting up a reactive system to update those DOM nodes.
- **Performance:** This has huge performance implications: Leptos is simply much faster at both creating and updating the UI than Yew is.
- **Server integration:** Yew was created in an era in which browser-rendered single-page apps (SPAs) were the dominant paradigm. While Leptos supports client-side rendering, it also focuses on integrating with the server side of your application via server functions and multiple modes of serving HTML, including out-of-order streaming.

### How is this different from Dioxus?

Like Leptos, Dioxus is a framework for building UIs using web technologies. However, there are significant differences in approach and features.

- **VDOM vs. fine-grained:** While Dioxus has a performant virtual DOM (VDOM), it still uses coarse-grained/component-scoped reactivity: changing a stateful value reruns the component function and diffs the old UI against the new one. Leptos components use a different mental model, creating (and returning) actual DOM nodes and setting up a reactive system to update those DOM nodes.
- **Web vs. desktop priorities:** Dioxus uses Leptos server functions in its fullstack mode, but does not have the same `&lt;Suspense&gt;`-based support for things like streaming HTML rendering, or share the same focus on holistic web performance. Leptos tends to prioritize holistic web performance (streaming HTML rendering, smaller WASM binary sizes, etc.), whereas Dioxus has an unparalleled experience when building desktop apps, because your application logic runs as a native Rust binary.

### How is this different from Sycamore?

Sycamore and Leptos are both heavily influenced by SolidJS. At this point, Leptos has a larger community and ecosystem and is more actively developed. Other differences:

- **Templating DSLs:** Sycamore uses a custom templating language for its views, while Leptos uses a JSX-like template format.
- **`&#039;static` signals:** One of Leptos’s main innovations was the creation of `Copy + &#039;static` signals, which have excellent ergonomics. Sycamore is in the process of adopting the same pattern, but this is not yet released.
- **Perseus vs. server functions:** The Perseus metaframework provides an opinionated way to build Sycamore apps that include server functionality. Leptos instead provides primitives like server functions in the core of the framework.

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in `ci/rust-version.sh` and if necessary, install that version by running:

```bash
$ rustup install VERSION
```

Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an [override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in order to use the correct version.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

On Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo test
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

- `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it&#039;s a _solution_ to
some problem. Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of _problems_ the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn&#039;t _infringe_ on anyone else&#039;s solutions. Adding a
test _protects_ your solution from future changes. Say you don&#039;t understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, &quot;what
problem is solved by this code?&quot; On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it&#039;s protecting, please
send us that patch!

    Welcome to the era of Sovereign Computing
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    StartOS is an open source Linux distribution optimized for running a personal server. It facilitates the discovery, installation, network configuration, service configuration, data backup, dependency management, and health monitoring of self-hosted software services.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;assets/StartOS.png&quot; alt=&quot;StartOS&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

## Running StartOS
&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; StartOS is in beta. It lacks features. It doesn&#039;t always work perfectly. Start9 servers are not plug and play. Using them properly requires some effort and patience. Please do not use StartOS or purchase a server if you are unable or unwilling to follow instructions and learn new concepts.

### 💰 Buy a Start9 server
This is the most convenient option. Simply [buy a server](https://store.start9.com) from Start9 and plug it in.

### 👷 Build your own server
This option is easier than you might imagine, and there are 4 reasons why you might prefer it:
1. You already have hardware
1. You want to save on shipping costs
1. You prefer not to divulge your physical address
1. You just like building things

To pursue this option, follow one of our [DIY guides](https://start9.com/latest/diy).

## ❤️ Contributing

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ˈdiːnoʊ/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

**Slint** is an open-source declarative GUI toolkit for building native user interfaces for embedded systems, desktops, and mobile platforms.

Write your UI once in `.slint`, a simple markup language. Connect it to business logic written in Rust, C++, JavaScript, or Python.

## Why Slint?

The name *Slint* is derived from our design goals:

- **Scalable**: Slint should support responsive UI design, allow cross-platform
    usage across operating systems and processor architectures and support
    multiple programming languages.
- **Lightweight**: Slint should require minimal resources, in terms of memory
    and processing power, and yet deliver a smooth, smartphone-like user
    experience on any device.
- **Intuitive**: Designers and developers should feel productive while enjoying
    the GUI design and development process. The design creation tools should be
    intuitive to use for the designers. Similarly for the developers, the APIs
    should be consistent and easy to use, no matter which programming language
    they choose.
- **Native**: GUI built with Slint should match the end users&#039; expectations of a
    native application irrespective of the platform - desktop, mobile, web or
    embedded system. The UI design should be compiled to machine code and provide
    flexibility that only a native application can offer: Access full operating
    system APIs, utilize all CPU and GPU cores, connect to any peripheral.

Beyond the design goals, here’s what makes Slint stand out:

- **Independent UI Design**: Use a declarative language similar to separate your UI from business logic. Designers can work in parallel with developers.
- **Tooling**: Iterate quickly with our Live Preview &amp; editor integrations. Integrate from Figma with the [Slint To Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1474418299182276871/figma-to-slint).
- **Stable APIs**: Slint follows a stable 1.x API. We evolve carefully without breaking your code.

## Get Started

### Hello World

The UI is defined in a Domain Specific Language that is declarative, easy to use,
intuitive, and provides a powerful way to describe graphical elements, their
placement, their hierarchy, property bindings, and the flow of data through the
different states.

Here&#039;s the obligatory &quot;Hello World&quot;:

```slint
export component HelloWorld inherits Window {
    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;

    Text {
       y: parent.width / 2;
       x: parent.x + 200px;
       text: &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
       color: blue;
    }
}
```

### Documentation

For more details, check out the [Slint Language Documentation](https://slint.dev/docs/slint).

## Architecture

An application is composed of the business logic written in Rust, C++, or
JavaScript and the `.slint` user interface design markup, which is compiled to
native code.

![Architecture Overview](https://slint.dev/resources/architecture.drawio.svg)

### Compiler

The `.slint` files are compiled ahead of time. The expressions in the `.slint`
are pure functions that the compiler can optimize. For example, the compiler
could choose to &quot;inline&quot; properties and remove those that are constant or
unchanged.

The compiler uses the typical compiler phases of lexing, parsing, optimization,
and finally code generation. It provides different back-ends for code generation
in the target language. The C++ code generator produces a C++ header file, the
Rust generator produces Rust code, and so on. An interpreter for dynamic
languages is also included.

### Runtime

The runtime library consists of an engine that supports properties declared in
the `.slint` language. Components with their elements, items, and properties are
laid out in a single memory region, to reduce memory allocations.

Rendering backends and styles are configurable at compile time:

- The `femtovg` renderer uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.
- The `skia` renderer uses [Skia](https://skia.org) for rendering.
- The `software` renderer uses the CPU with no additional dependencies.

NOTE: When Qt is installed on the system, the `qt` style becomes available,
using Qt&#039;s QStyle to achieve native looking widgets.

### Tooling

We have a few tools to help with the development of .slint files:

- A [**LSP Server**](./tools/lsp) that adds features like auto-complete and live
  preview of the .slint files to many editors.
- It is bundled in a [**Visual Studio Code Extension**](./editors/vscode)
  available from the market place.
- A [**slint-viewer**](./tools/viewer) tool which displays the .slint files. The
  `--auto-reload` argument makes it easy to preview your UI while you are
  working on it (when using the LSP preview is not possible).
- [**SlintPad**](https://slintpad.com/), an online editor to try out .slint syntax
  without installing anything ([sources](./tools/slintpad)).
- A [**Figma to Slint**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1474418299182276871/figma-to-slint) plugin.

Please check our [Editors README](./editors/README.md) for tips on how to
configure your favorite editor to work well with Slint.
