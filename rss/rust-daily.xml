### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [📖 Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

You can find additional [setup and configurations guides](https://getfoundry.sh/config/overview) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs] and in the [config crate](./crates/config/README.md):

A secure, stable and high-performance reverse proxy for NAT traversal, written in Rust

rathole, like [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) and [ngrok](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok), can help to expose the service on the device behind the NAT to the Internet, via a server with a public IP.

&lt;!-- /TOC --&gt;

## Features

- **High Performance** Much higher throughput can be achieved than frp, and more stable when handling a large volume of connections. See [Benchmark](#benchmark)
- **Low Resource Consumption** Consumes much fewer memory than similar tools. See [Benchmark](#benchmark). [The binary can be](docs/build-guide.md) **as small as ~500KiB** to fit the constraints of devices, like embedded devices as routers.
- **Security** Tokens of services are mandatory and service-wise. The server and clients are responsible for their own configs. With the optional Noise Protocol, encryption can be configured at ease. No need to create a self-signed certificate! TLS is also supported.
- **Hot Reload** Services can be added or removed dynamically by hot-reloading the configuration file. HTTP API is WIP.

## Quickstart

A full-powered `rathole` can be obtained from the [release](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/releases) page. Or [build from source](docs/build-guide.md) **for other platforms and minimizing the binary**. A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapiz1/rathole) is also available.

The usage of `rathole` is very similar to frp. If you have experience with the latter, then the configuration is very easy for you. The only difference is that configuration of a service is split into the client side and the server side, and a token is mandatory.

To use `rathole`, you need a server with a public IP, and a device behind the NAT, where some services that need to be exposed to the Internet.

Assuming you have a NAS at home behind the NAT, and want to expose its ssh service to the Internet:

1. On the server which has a public IP

Create `server.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# server.toml
[server]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:2333&quot; # `2333` specifies the port that rathole listens for clients

[server.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Token that is used to authenticate the client for the service. Change to an arbitrary value.
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:5202&quot; # `5202` specifies the port that exposes `my_nas_ssh` to the Internet
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole server.toml
```

2. On the host which is behind the NAT (your NAS)

Create `client.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# client.toml
[client]
remote_addr = &quot;myserver.com:2333&quot; # The address of the server. The port must be the same with the port in `server.bind_addr`

[client.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Must be the same with the server to pass the validation
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:22&quot; # The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole client.toml
```

3. Now the client will try to connect to the server `myserver.com` on port `2333`, and any traffic to `myserver.com:5202` will be forwarded to the client&#039;s port `22`.

So you can `ssh myserver.com:5202` to ssh to your NAS.

To run `rathole` run as a background service on Linux, checkout the [systemd examples](./examples/systemd).

## Configuration

`rathole` can automatically determine to run in the server mode or the client mode, according to the content of the configuration file, if only one of `[server]` and `[client]` block is present, like the example in [Quickstart](#quickstart).

But the `[client]` and `[server]` block can also be put in one file. Then on the server side, run `rathole --server config.toml` and on the client side, run `rathole --client config.toml` to explicitly tell `rathole` the running mode.

Before heading to the full configuration specification, it&#039;s recommend to skim [the configuration examples](./examples) to get a feeling of the configuration format.

See [Transport](./docs/transport.md) for more details about encryption and the `transport` block.

Here is the full configuration specification:

```toml
[client]
remote_addr = &quot;example.com:2333&quot; # Necessary. The address of the server
default_token = &quot;default_token_if_not_specify&quot; # Optional. The default token of services, if they don&#039;t define their own ones
heartbeat_timeout = 40 # Optional. Set to 0 to disable the application-layer heartbeat test. The value must be greater than `server.heartbeat_interval`. Default: 40 seconds
retry_interval = 1 # Optional. The interval between retry to connect to the server. Default: 1 second

[client.transport] # The whole block is optional. Specify which transport to use
type = &quot;tcp&quot; # Optional. Possible values: [&quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;tls&quot;, &quot;noise&quot;]. Default: &quot;tcp&quot;

[client.transport.tcp] # Optional. Also affects `noise` and `tls`

hostname = &quot;example.com&quot; # Optional. The hostname that the client uses to validate the certificate. If not set, fallback to `client.remote_addr`

[client.transport.noise] # Noise protocol. See `docs/transport.md` for further explanation
pattern = &quot;Noise_NK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s&quot; # Optional. Default value as shown
local_private_key = &quot;key_encoded_in_base64&quot; # Optional
remote_public_key = &quot;key_encoded_in_base64&quot; # Optional

[client.transport.websocket] # Necessary if `type` is &quot;websocket&quot;
tls = true # If `true` then it will use settings in `client.transport.tls`

[client.services.service1] # A service that needs forwarding. The name `service1` can change arbitrarily, as long as identical to the name in the server&#039;s configuration
type = &quot;tcp&quot; # Optional. The protocol that needs forwarding. Possible values: [&quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;udp&quot;]. Default: &quot;tcp&quot;
token = &quot;whatever&quot; # Necessary if `client.default_token` not set
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:1081&quot; # Necessary. The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
nodelay = true # Optional. Override the `client.transport.nodelay` per service
retry_interval = 1 # Optional. The interval between retry to connect to the server. Default: inherits the global config

[client.services.service2] # Multiple services can be defined
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:1082&quot;

[server]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:2333&quot; # Necessary. The address that the server listens for clients. Generally only the port needs to be change.
default_token = &quot;default_token_if_not_specify&quot; # Optional
heartbeat_interval = 30 # Optional. The interval between two application-layer heartbeat. Set to 0 to disable sending heartbeat. Default: 30 seconds

[server.transport] # Same as `[client.transport]`
type = &quot;tcp&quot;

[server.transport.tcp] # Same as the client
nodelay = true
keepalive_secs = 20
keepalive_interval = 8

[server.transport.tls] # Necessary if `type` is &quot;tls&quot;
pkcs12 = &quot;identify.pfx&quot; # Necessary. pkcs12 file of server&#039;s certificate and private key
pkcs12_password = &quot;password&quot; # Necessary. Password of the pkcs12 file

[server.transport.noise] # Same as `[client.transport.noise]`
pattern = &quot;Noise_NK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s&quot;
local_private_key = &quot;key_encoded_in_base64&quot;
remote_public_key = &quot;key_encoded_in_base64&quot;

[server.transport.websocket] # Necessary if `type` is &quot;websocket&quot;
tls = true # If `true` then it will use settings in `server.transport.tls`

[server.services.service1] # The service name must be identical to the client side

token = &quot;whatever&quot; # Necessary if `server.default_token` not set
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:8081&quot; # Necessary. The address of the service is exposed at. Generally only the port needs to be change.
nodelay = true # Optional. Same as the client

[server.services.service2]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.1:8082&quot;
```

### Logging

`rathole`, like many other Rust programs, use environment variables to control the logging level. `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, `trace` are available.

```shell
RUST_LOG=error ./rathole config.toml
```

will run `rathole` with only error level logging.

If `RUST_LOG` is not present, the default logging level is `info`.

### Tuning

From v0.4.7, rathole enables TCP_NODELAY by default, which should benefit the latency and interactive applications like rdp, Minecraft servers. However, it slightly decreases the bandwidth.

If the bandwidth is more important, TCP_NODELAY can be opted out with `nodelay = false`.

## Benchmark

rathole has similar latency to [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), but can handle a more connections, provide larger bandwidth, with less memory usage.

For more details, see the separate page [Benchmark](./docs/benchmark.md).

**However, don&#039;t take it from here that `rathole` can magically make your forwarded service faster several times than before.** The benchmark is done on local loopback, indicating the performance when the task is cpu-bounded. One can gain quite a improvement if the network is not the bottleneck. Unfortunately, that&#039;s not true for many users. In that case, the main benefit is lower resource consumption, while the bandwidth and the latency may not improved significantly.

# Your procedural toolbox for 2D content creation

**Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics engine, [available now](https://editor.graphite.rs) in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.**

Having begun life as a vector editor, Graphite continues evolving into a generalized, all-in-one graphics toolbox that&#039;s built more like a game engine than a conventional creative app. The editor&#039;s tools wrap its node graph core, providing user-friendly workflows for vector, raster, and beyond. Photo editing, motion graphics, digital painting, desktop publishing, and VFX compositing are additional competencies on the planned [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#roadmap) making Graphite into a highly versatile content creation tool.

## About

Turso Database is an in-process SQL database written in Rust, compatible with SQLite.

&gt; **⚠️ Warning:** This software is ALPHA, only use for development, testing, and experimentation. We are working to make it production ready, but do not use it for critical data right now.
&gt; 
## Features and Roadmap

* **SQLite compatibility** for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API [see [document](COMPAT.md) for details]
* **Change data capture (CDC)** for real-time tracking of database changes.
* **Language support** for
  * [Go](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go)
  * [JavaScript](bindings/javascript)
  * [Java](bindings/java)
  * [Python](bindings/python)
  * [Rust](bindings/rust)
  * [WebAssembly](bindings/javascript)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **Cross-platform** support for Linux, macOS, Windows and browsers (through WebAssembly)
* **Vector support** support including exact search and vector manipulation
* **Improved schema management** including extended `ALTER` support and faster schema changes.

The database has the following experimental features:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput using multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
* **Incremental computation** using DBSP for incremental view mainatenance and query subscriptions.

The following features are on our current roadmap:

* **Vector indexing** for fast approximate vector search, similar to [libSQL vector search](https://turso.tech/vector).

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the interactive shell:

```shell
$ tursodb
```

This will start the Turso interactive shell where you can execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```

If you like docker, we got you covered. Simply run this in the root folder:

```bash
make docker-cli-build &amp;&amp; \
make docker-cli-run
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/database
```

Example usage:

```js
import { connect } from &#039;@tursodatabase/database&#039;;

const db = await connect(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
uv pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦫 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go
go install github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;turso&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;☕️ Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Turso Database into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Turso Database with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🤖 MCP Server Mode&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


The Turso CLI includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your databases.

Start the MCP server with:

```shell
tursodb your_database.db --mcp
```

The MCP server provides seven tools for database interaction:

#### Available Tools

1. **`open_database`** - Open a new database
2. **`current_database`** - Describe the current database
3. **`list_tables`** - List all tables in the database
4. **`describe_table`** - Describe the structure of a specific table
5. **`execute_query`** - Execute read-only SELECT queries
6. **`insert_data`** - Insert new data into tables
7. **`update_data`** - Update existing data in tables
8. **`delete_data`** - Delete data from tables
9. **`schema_change`** - Execute schema modification statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

#### Example Usage

The MCP server runs as a single process that handles multiple JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout. Here&#039;s how to interact with it:

#### Example with In-Memory Database

```bash
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;schema_change&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 4, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;insert_data&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;Alice&#039;, &#039;alice@example.com&#039;)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;execute_query&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;}}}
EOF
```

#### Example with Existing Database

```bash
# Working with an existing database file
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb mydb.db --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
EOF
```

#### Using with Claude Code

If you&#039;re using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), you can easily connect to your Turso MCP server using the built-in MCP management commands:

##### Quick Setup

1. **Add the MCP server** to Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to activate the connection

3. **Start querying** your database through natural language!

##### Command Breakdown

```bash
claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
#              ↑            ↑       ↑                           ↑
#              |            |       |                           |
#              Name         |       Database path               MCP flag
#                          Separator
```

- **`my-database`** - Choose any name for your MCP server
- **`--`** - Required separator between Claude options and your command
- **`tursodb`** - The Turso database CLI
- **`./path/to/your/database.db`** - Path to your SQLite database file
- **`--mcp`** - Enables MCP server mode

##### Example Usage

```bash
# For a local project database
cd /your/project
claude mcp add my-project-db -- tursodb ./data/app.db --mcp

# For an absolute path
claude mcp add analytics-db -- tursodb /Users/you/databases/analytics.db --mcp

# For a specific project (local scope)
claude mcp add project-db --local -- tursodb ./database.db --mcp
```

##### Managing MCP Servers

```bash
# List all configured MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Get details about a specific server
claude mcp get my-database

# Remove an MCP server
claude mcp remove my-database
```

Once configured, you can ask Claude Code to:
- &quot;Show me all tables in the database&quot;
- &quot;What&#039;s the schema for the users table?&quot;
- &quot;Find all posts with more than 100 upvotes&quot;
- &quot;Insert a new user with name &#039;Alice&#039; and email &#039;alice@example.com&#039;&quot;
&lt;/details&gt;

## Contributing

We&#039;d love to have you contribute to Turso Database! Please check out the [contribution guide] to get started.

### Found a data corruption bug? Get up to $1,000.00

SQLite is loved because it is the most reliable database in the world. The next evolution of SQLite has
to match or surpass this level of reliability. Turso is built with [Deterministic Simulation Testing](simulator/)
from the ground up, and is also tested by [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com).

Even during Alpha, if you find a bug that leads to a data corruption and demonstrate
how our simulator failed to catch it, you can get up to $1,000.00. As the project matures we will
increase the size of the prize, and the scope of the bugs.

More details [here](https://turso.algora.io).

You can see an example of an awarded case on [#2049](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/issues/2049).

Turso core staff are not eligible.


## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevy.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevy.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

## About NEAR

NEAR&#039;s purpose is to enable community-driven innovation to benefit people around the world.

To achieve this purpose, *NEAR* provides a developer platform where developers and entrepreneurs can create apps that put users back in control of their data and assets, which is the foundation of [&quot;Open Web&quot; movement][open-web-url].

One of the components of *NEAR* is the NEAR Protocol, an infrastructure for server-less applications and smart contracts powered by a blockchain.
NEAR Protocol is built to deliver usability and scalability of modern PaaS like Firebase at fraction of the prices that blockchains like Ethereum charge.

Overall, *NEAR* provides a wide range of tools for developers to easily build applications:
 - [JS Client library][js-api] to connect to NEAR Protocol from your applications.
 - [Rust][rust-sdk] and [JavaScript/TypeScript][js-sdk] SDKs to write smart contracts and stateful server-less functions.
 - [Several essential repositories](https://github.com/near/dx) to guide you in building across Near&#039;s Open Web Platform.
 - [Numerous examples][examples-url] with links to hack on them right inside your browser.
 - [Lots of documentation][docs-url], with [Tutorials][tutorials-url] and [API docs][api-docs-url].

## Join the Network

The easiest way to join the network, is by using the `nearup` command, which you can install as follows:

```bash
pip3 install --user nearup
```

You can join all the active networks:
* mainnet: `nearup run mainnet`
* testnet: `nearup run testnet`
* betanet: `nearup run betanet`

Check the `nearup` repository for [more details](https://github.com/near/nearup) on how to run with or without docker.

To learn how to become a validator, checkout [documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/node/validator/staking-and-delegation).

## Contributing

The workflow and details of setup to contribute are described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and security policy is described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
To propose new protocol changes or standards use [Specification &amp; Standards repository](https://github.com/nearprotocol/NEPs).

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Build for web, desktop, and mobile, and more with a single codebase. Zero-config setup, integrated hot-reloading, and signals-based state management. Add backend functionality with Server Functions and bundle with our CLI.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);

    rsx! {
        h1 { &quot;High-Five counter: {count}&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, &quot;Up high!&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, &quot;Down low!&quot; }
    }
}
```

## ⭐️ Unique features:

- Cross-platform apps in three lines of code (web, desktop, mobile, server, and more)
- [Ergonomic state management](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/release-050) combines the best of React, Solid, and Svelte
- Built-in featureful, type-safe, fullstack web framework
- Integrated bundler for deploying to the web, macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Subsecond Rust hot-patching and asset hot-reloading
- And more! [Take a tour of Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/).

## Instant hot-reloading

With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup, styles, and see changes in milliseconds. Use our experimental `dx serve --hotpatch` to update Rust code in real time.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Build Beautiful Apps

Dioxus apps are styled with HTML and CSS. Use the built-in TailwindCSS support or load your favorite CSS library. Easily call into native code (objective-c, JNI, Web-Sys) for a perfect native touch.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/ebou2.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Experimental Native Renderer

Render using web-sys, webview, server-side-rendering, liveview, or even with our experimental WGPU-based renderer. Embed Dioxus in Bevy, WGPU, or even run on embedded Linux!

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioxusLabs/screenshots/refs/heads/main/blitz/native-blitz-wgpu.webp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## First-party primitive components

Get started quickly with a complete set of primitives modeled after shadcn/ui and Radix-Primitives.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/primitive-components.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## First-class Android and iOS support

Dioxus is the fastest way to build native mobile apps with Rust. Simply run `dx serve --platform android` and your app is running in an emulator or on device in seconds. Call directly into JNI and Native APIs.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/android_and_ios2.avif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Productive, typesafe, fullstack web framework

Directly call your backend from your frontend with our built-in type-safe RPC using [`server_fn`](http://crates.io/crates/server_fn). Supports streaming, suspense, bundle splitting, websockets, and more.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
  let mut fortune = use_signal(|| &quot;Fetch a fortune!&quot;);
  rsx! {
    h1 { &quot;{fortune}&quot; }
    button {
      onclick: move |_| async move {
        fortune.set(fetch_fortune().await.unwrap());
      }
    }
  }
}

#[server]
async fn fetch_fortune() -&gt; ServerFnResult&lt;String&gt; {
  &quot;Dioxus is super productive!&quot;.to_string()
}
```

## Bundle for web, desktop, and mobile

Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guides/assets), and more. Build WebApps weighing [less than 50kb](https://github.com/ealmloff/tiny-dioxus/) and desktop/mobile apps less than 5mb.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


## Fantastic documentation

We&#039;ve put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our Docs runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/) for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new Dioxus features - [check it out!](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/docs.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Modular and Customizable

Build your own renderer, or use a community renderer like [Freya](http://freyaui.dev). Use our modular components like RSX, VirtualDom, Blitz, Taffy, and Subsecond.

## Running the examples

&gt; The examples in the main branch of this repository target the git version of dioxus and the CLI. If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the [0.6 branch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples).

The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;
```

However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli to test out features like hot-reloading. To install the most recent binary CLI, you can use cargo binstall.

```sh
cargo binstall dioxus-cli@0.7.0-rc.0 --force
```

If this CLI is out-of-date, you can install it directly from git

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked
```

With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You will need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:

```sh
dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features
```

WRKFLW is a powerful command-line tool for validating and executing GitHub Actions workflows locally, without requiring a full GitHub environment. It helps developers test their workflows directly on their machines before pushing changes to GitHub.

![WRKFLW Demo](demo.gif)

## Features

- **TUI Interface**: A full-featured terminal user interface for managing and monitoring workflow executions
- **Validate Workflow Files**: Check for syntax errors and common mistakes in GitHub Actions workflow files with proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
- **Execute Workflows Locally**: Run workflows directly on your machine using Docker or Podman containers
- **Multiple Container Runtimes**: Support for Docker, Podman, and emulation mode for maximum flexibility
- **Job Dependency Resolution**: Automatically determines the correct execution order based on job dependencies
- **Container Integration**: Execute workflow steps in isolated containers with proper environment setup
- **GitHub Context**: Provides GitHub-like environment variables and workflow commands
- **Rootless Execution**: Podman support enables running containers without root privileges
- **Action Support**: Supports various GitHub Actions types:
  - Docker container actions
  - JavaScript actions
  - Composite actions
  - Local actions
- **Special Action Handling**: Native handling for commonly used actions like `actions/checkout`
- **Reusable Workflows (Caller Jobs)**: Execute jobs that call reusable workflows via `jobs.&lt;id&gt;.uses` (local path or `owner/repo/path@ref`)
- **Output Capturing**: View logs, step outputs, and execution details
- **Parallel Job Execution**: Runs independent jobs in parallel for faster workflow execution
- **Trigger Workflows Remotely**: Manually trigger workflow runs on GitHub or GitLab

## Requirements

### Container Runtime (Optional)

WRKFLW supports multiple container runtimes for isolated execution:

- **Docker**: The default container runtime. Install from [docker.com](https://docker.com)
- **Podman**: A rootless container runtime. Perfect for environments where Docker isn&#039;t available or permitted. Install from [podman.io](https://podman.io)
- **Emulation**: No container runtime required. Executes commands directly on the host system

### Podman Support

Podman is particularly useful in environments where:
- Docker installation is not permitted by your organization
- Root privileges are not available for Docker daemon
- You prefer rootless container execution
- Enhanced security through daemonless architecture is desired

To use Podman:
```bash
# Install Podman (varies by OS)
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew install podman

# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install podman

# Initialize Podman machine (macOS/Windows)
podman machine init
podman machine start

# Use with wrkflw
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

## Installation

The recommended way to install `wrkflw` is using Rust&#039;s package manager, Cargo:

### Using Cargo Install (Recommended)
```bash
cargo install wrkflw
```

### From Source

Clone the repository and build using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bahdotsh/wrkflw.git
cd wrkflw
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available at `target/release/wrkflw`.

## Usage

The simplest way to use WRKFLW is to navigate to your project&#039;s root directory and run:

```bash
wrkflw
```

This will automatically detect and load all workflows from `.github/workflows` directory into the TUI interface.

WRKFLW also provides three main command modes:

### Validating Workflow Files

```bash
# Validate all workflow files in the default location (.github/workflows)
wrkflw validate

# Validate a specific workflow file
wrkflw validate path/to/workflow.yml

# Validate workflows in a specific directory
wrkflw validate path/to/workflows

# Validate multiple files and/or directories (GitHub and GitLab are auto-detected)
wrkflw validate path/to/flow-1.yml path/to/flow-2.yml path/to/workflows

# Force GitLab parsing for all provided paths
wrkflw validate --gitlab .gitlab-ci.yml other.gitlab-ci.yml

# Validate with verbose output
wrkflw validate --verbose path/to/workflow.yml

# Validate GitLab CI pipelines
wrkflw validate .gitlab-ci.yml --gitlab

# Disable exit codes for custom error handling (default: enabled)
wrkflw validate --no-exit-code path/to/workflow.yml
```

#### Exit Codes for CI/CD Integration

By default, `wrkflw validate` sets the exit code to `1` when validation fails, making it perfect for CI/CD pipelines and scripts:

```bash
# In CI/CD scripts - validation failure will cause the script to exit
if ! wrkflw validate; then
    echo &quot;❌ Workflow validation failed!&quot;
    exit 1
fi
echo &quot;✅ All workflows are valid!&quot;

# For custom error handling, disable exit codes
wrkflw validate --no-exit-code
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo &quot;Validation completed (check output for details)&quot;
fi
```

**Exit Code Behavior:**
- `0`: All validations passed successfully
- `1`: One or more validation failures detected
- `2`: Command usage error (invalid arguments, file not found, etc.)

### Running Workflows in CLI Mode

```bash
# Run a workflow with Docker (default)
wrkflw run .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run a workflow with Podman instead of Docker
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run a workflow in emulation mode (without containers)
wrkflw run --runtime emulation .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run with verbose output
wrkflw run --verbose .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Preserve failed containers for debugging
wrkflw run --preserve-containers-on-failure .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Using the TUI Interface

```bash
# Open TUI with workflows from the default directory
wrkflw tui

# Open TUI with a specific directory of workflows
wrkflw tui path/to/workflows

# Open TUI with a specific workflow pre-selected
wrkflw tui path/to/workflow.yml

# Open TUI with Podman runtime
wrkflw tui --runtime podman

# Open TUI in emulation mode
wrkflw tui --runtime emulation
```

### Triggering Workflows Remotely

```bash
# Trigger a workflow remotely on GitHub
wrkflw trigger workflow-name --branch main --input key1=value1 --input key2=value2

# Trigger a pipeline remotely on GitLab
wrkflw trigger-gitlab --branch main --variable key1=value1 --variable key2=value2
```

## TUI Controls

The terminal user interface provides an interactive way to manage workflows:

- **Tab / 1-4**: Switch between tabs (Workflows, Execution, Logs, Help)
- **Up/Down or j/k**: Navigate lists
- **Space**: Toggle workflow selection
- **Enter**: Run selected workflow / View job details
- **r**: Run all selected workflows
- **a**: Select all workflows
- **n**: Deselect all workflows
- **e**: Cycle through runtime modes (Docker → Podman → Emulation)
- **v**: Toggle between Execution and Validation mode
- **Esc**: Back / Exit detailed view
- **q**: Quit application

## Examples

### Validating a Workflow

```bash
$ wrkflw validate .github/workflows/rust.yml
Validating GitHub workflow file: .github/workflows/rust.yml... Validating 1 workflow file(s)...
✅ Valid: .github/workflows/rust.yml

Summary: 1 valid, 0 invalid

$ echo $?
0

# Example with validation failure
$ wrkflw validate .github/workflows/invalid.yml
Validating GitHub workflow file: .github/workflows/invalid.yml... Validating 1 workflow file(s)...
❌ Invalid: .github/workflows/invalid.yml
   1. Job &#039;test&#039; is missing &#039;runs-on&#039; field
   2. Job &#039;test&#039; is missing &#039;steps&#039; section

Summary: 0 valid, 1 invalid

$ echo $?
1
```

### Running a Workflow

```bash
$ wrkflw run .github/workflows/rust.yml

Executing workflow: .github/workflows/rust.yml
============================================================
Runtime: Docker
------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Job succeeded: build

------------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ Checkout code
  ✅ Set up Rust
  ✅ Build
  ✅ Run tests

✅ Workflow completed successfully!
```

### Quick TUI Startup

```bash
# Navigate to project root and run wrkflw
$ cd my-project
$ wrkflw

# This will automatically load .github/workflows files into the TUI
```

## System Requirements

- Rust 1.67 or later
- Container Runtime (optional, for container-based execution):
  - **Docker**: Traditional container runtime
  - **Podman**: Rootless alternative to Docker  
  - **None**: Emulation mode runs workflows using local system tools

## How It Works

WRKFLW parses your GitHub Actions workflow files and executes each job and step in the correct order. For container modes (Docker/Podman), it creates containers that closely match GitHub&#039;s runner environments. The workflow execution process:

1. **Parsing**: Reads and validates the workflow YAML structure
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Creates an execution plan based on job dependencies
3. **Environment Setup**: Prepares GitHub-like environment variables and context
4. **Execution**: Runs each job and step either in containers (Docker/Podman) or through local emulation
5. **Monitoring**: Tracks progress and captures outputs in the TUI or command line

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Environment Files Support

WRKFLW supports GitHub&#039;s environment files and special commands:

- `GITHUB_OUTPUT`: For storing step outputs (`echo &quot;result=value&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT`)
- `GITHUB_ENV`: For setting environment variables (`echo &quot;VAR=value&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV`)
- `GITHUB_PATH`: For modifying the PATH (`echo &quot;/path/to/dir&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_PATH`)
- `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`: For creating step summaries (`echo &quot;# Summary&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`)

### Composite Actions

WRKFLW supports composite actions, which are actions made up of multiple steps. This includes:

- Local composite actions referenced with `./path/to/action`
- Remote composite actions from GitHub repositories
- Nested composite actions (composite actions that use other actions)

### Container Cleanup

WRKFLW automatically cleans up any containers created during workflow execution (Docker/Podman), even if the process is interrupted with Ctrl+C.

For debugging failed workflows, you can preserve containers that fail by using the `--preserve-containers-on-failure` flag:

```bash
# Preserve failed containers for debugging
wrkflw run --preserve-containers-on-failure .github/workflows/build.yml

# Also available in TUI mode
wrkflw tui --preserve-containers-on-failure
```

When a container fails with this flag enabled, WRKFLW will:
- Keep the failed container running instead of removing it
- Log the container ID and provide inspection instructions
- Show a message like: `Preserving container abc123 for debugging (exit code: 1). Use &#039;docker exec -it abc123 bash&#039; to inspect.` (Docker)
- Or: `Preserving container abc123 for debugging (exit code: 1). Use &#039;podman exec -it abc123 bash&#039; to inspect.` (Podman)

This allows you to inspect the exact state of the container when the failure occurred, examine files, check environment variables, and debug issues more effectively.

### Podman-Specific Features

When using Podman as the container runtime, you get additional benefits:

**Rootless Operation:**
```bash
# Run workflows without root privileges
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

**Enhanced Security:**
- Daemonless architecture reduces attack surface
- User namespaces provide additional isolation
- No privileged daemon required

**Container Inspection:**
```bash
# List preserved containers
podman ps -a --filter &quot;name=wrkflw-&quot;

# Inspect a preserved container&#039;s filesystem (without executing)
podman mount &lt;container-id&gt;

# Or run a new container with the same volumes
podman run --rm -it --volumes-from &lt;failed-container&gt; ubuntu:20.04 bash

# Clean up all wrkflw containers
podman ps -a --filter &quot;name=wrkflw-&quot; --format &quot;{{.Names}}&quot; | xargs podman rm -f
```

**Compatibility:**
- Drop-in replacement for Docker workflows
- Same CLI options and behavior
- Identical container execution environment

## Limitations

### Supported Features
- ✅ Basic workflow syntax and validation (all YAML syntax checks, required fields, and structure) with proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
- ✅ Job dependency resolution and parallel execution (all jobs with correct &#039;needs&#039; relationships are executed in the right order, and independent jobs run in parallel)
- ✅ Matrix builds (supported for reasonable matrix sizes; very large matrices may be slow or resource-intensive)
- ✅ Environment variables and GitHub context (all standard GitHub Actions environment variables and context objects are emulated)
- ✅ Container actions (all actions that use containers are supported in Docker and Podman modes)
- ✅ JavaScript actions (all actions that use JavaScript are supported)
- ✅ Composite actions (all composite actions, including nested and local composite actions, are supported)
- ✅ Local actions (actions referenced with local paths are supported)
- ✅ Special handling for common actions (e.g., `actions/checkout` is natively supported)
- ✅ Reusable workflows (caller): Jobs that use `jobs.&lt;id&gt;.uses` to call local or remote workflows are executed; inputs and secrets are propagated to the called workflow
- ✅ Workflow triggering via `workflow_dispatch` (manual triggering of workflows is supported)
- ✅ GitLab pipeline triggering (manual triggering of GitLab pipelines is supported)
- ✅ Environment files (`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_PATH`, `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` are fully supported)
- ✅ TUI interface for workflow management and monitoring
- ✅ CLI interface for validation, execution, and remote triggering
- ✅ Output capturing (logs, step outputs, and execution details are available in both TUI and CLI)
- ✅ Container cleanup (all containers created by wrkflw are automatically cleaned up, even on interruption)

### Limited or Unsupported Features (Explicit List)
- ❌ GitHub secrets and permissions: Only basic environment variables are supported. GitHub&#039;s encrypted secrets and fine-grained permissions are NOT available.
- ❌ GitHub Actions cache: Caching functionality (e.g., `actions/cache`) is NOT supported in emulation mode and only partially supported in Docker and Podman modes (no persistent cache between runs).
- ❌ GitHub API integrations: Only basic workflow triggering is supported. Features like workflow status reporting, artifact upload/download, and API-based job control are NOT available.
- ❌ GitHub-specific environment variables: Some advanced or dynamic environment variables (e.g., those set by GitHub runners or by the GitHub API) are emulated with static or best-effort values, but not all are fully functional.
- ❌ Large/complex matrix builds: Very large matrices (hundreds or thousands of job combinations) may not be practical due to performance and resource limits.
- ❌ Network-isolated actions: Actions that require strict network isolation or custom network configuration may not work out-of-the-box and may require manual container runtime configuration.
- ❌ Some event triggers: Only `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger) is fully supported. Other triggers (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `release`, etc.) are NOT supported.
- ❌ GitHub runner-specific features: Features that depend on the exact GitHub-hosted runner environment (e.g., pre-installed tools, runner labels, or hardware) are NOT guaranteed to match. Only a best-effort emulation is provided.
- ❌ Windows and macOS runners: Only Linux-based runners are fully supported. Windows and macOS jobs are NOT supported.
- ❌ Service containers: Service containers (e.g., databases defined in `services:`) are only supported in Docker and Podman modes. In emulation mode, they are NOT supported.
- ❌ Artifacts: Uploading and downloading artifacts between jobs/steps is NOT supported.
- ❌ Job/step timeouts: Custom timeouts for jobs and steps are NOT enforced.
- ❌ Job/step concurrency and cancellation: Features like `concurrency` and job cancellation are NOT supported.
- ❌ Expressions and advanced YAML features: Most common expressions are supported, but some advanced or edge-case expressions may not be fully implemented.
- ⚠️ Reusable workflows (limits):
  - Outputs from called workflows are not propagated back to the caller (`needs.&lt;id&gt;.outputs.*` not supported)
  - `secrets: inherit` is not special-cased; provide a mapping to pass secrets
  - Remote calls clone public repos via HTTPS; private repos require preconfigured access (not yet implemented)
  - Deeply nested reusable calls work but lack cycle detection beyond regular job dependency checks

## Reusable Workflows

WRKFLW supports executing reusable workflow caller jobs.

### Syntax

```yaml
jobs:
  call-local:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/shared.yml

  call-remote:
    uses: my-org/my-repo/.github/workflows/shared.yml@v1
    with:
      foo: bar
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
```

### Behavior
- Local references are resolved relative to the current working directory.
- Remote references are shallow-cloned at the specified `@ref` into a temporary directory.
- `with:` entries are exposed to the called workflow as environment variables `INPUT_&lt;KEY&gt;`.
- `secrets:` mapping entries are exposed as environment variables `SECRET_&lt;KEY&gt;`.
- The called workflow executes according to its own `jobs`/`needs`; a summary of its job results is reported as a single result for the caller job.

### Current limitations
- Outputs from called workflows are not surfaced back to the caller.
- `secrets: inherit` is not supported; specify an explicit mapping.
- Private repositories for remote `uses:` are not yet supported.

### Runtime Mode Differences
- **Docker Mode**: Provides the closest match to GitHub&#039;s environment, including support for Docker container actions, service containers, and Linux-based jobs. Some advanced container configurations may still require manual setup.
- **Podman Mode**: Similar to Docker mode but uses Podman for container execution. Offers rootless container support and enhanced security. Fully compatible with Docker-based workflows.
- **🔒 Secure Emulation Mode**: Runs workflows on the local system with comprehensive sandboxing for security. **Recommended for local development**:
  - Command validation and filtering (blocks dangerous commands like `rm -rf /`, `sudo`, etc.)
  - Resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time)
  - Filesystem access controls
  - Process monitoring and limits
  - Safe for running untrusted workflows locally
- **⚠️ Emulation Mode (Legacy)**: Runs workflows using local system tools without sandboxing. **Not recommended - use Secure Emulation instead**:
  - Only supports local and JavaScript actions (no Docker container actions)
  - No support for service containers
  - No caching support
  - **No security protections - can execute harmful commands**
  - Some actions may require adaptation to work locally

### Best Practices
- **Use Secure Emulation mode for local development** - provides safety without container overhead
- Test workflows in multiple runtime modes to ensure compatibility
- **Use Docker/Podman mode for production** - provides maximum isolation and reproducibility
- Keep matrix builds reasonably sized for better performance
- Use environment variables instead of GitHub secrets when possible
- Consider using local actions for complex custom functionality
- **Review security warnings** - pay attention to blocked commands in secure emulation mode
- **Start with secure mode** - only fall back to legacy emulation if necessary

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[wcc]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/
[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any

send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [colocated local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#colocated-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily restore to
an earlier repo state, simply undo your operations one-by-one or even _revert_ a
particular operation which does not have to be the most recent one.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

`just` is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.

This readme is also available as a [book](https://just.systems/man/en/). The
book reflects the latest release, whereas the
[readme on GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.md)
reflects latest master.

(中文文档在 [这里](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.中文.md),
快看过来!)

Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called `justfile` with syntax
inspired by `make`:

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casey/just/master/screenshot.png)

You can then run them with `just RECIPE`:

```console
$ just test-all
cc *.c -o main
./test --all
Yay, all your tests passed!
```

`just` has a ton of useful features, and many improvements over `make`:

- `just` is a command runner, not a build system, so it avoids much of
  [`make`&#039;s complexity and idiosyncrasies](#what-are-the-idiosyncrasies-of-make-that-just-avoids).
  No need for `.PHONY` recipes!

- Linux, MacOS, Windows, and other reasonable unices are supported with no
  additional dependencies. (Although if your system doesn&#039;t have an `sh`,
  you&#039;ll need to [choose a different shell](#shell).)

- Errors are specific and informative, and syntax errors are reported along
  with their source context.

- Recipes can accept [command line arguments](#recipe-parameters).

- Wherever possible, errors are resolved statically. Unknown recipes and
  circular dependencies are reported before anything runs.

- `just` [loads `.env` files](#dotenv-settings), making it easy to populate
  environment variables.

- Recipes can be [listed from the command line](#listing-available-recipes).

- Command line completion scripts are
  [available for most popular shells](#shell-completion-scripts).

- Recipes can be written in
  [arbitrary languages](#shebang-recipes), like Python or NodeJS.

- `just` can be invoked from any subdirectory, not just the directory that
  contains the `justfile`.

- And [much more](https://just.systems/man/en/)!

If you need help with `just` please feel free to open an issue or ping me on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/ezYScXR). Feature requests and bug reports are
always welcome!

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

`just` should run on any system with a reasonable `sh`, including Linux, MacOS,
and the BSDs.

#### Windows

On Windows, `just` works with the `sh` provided by
[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com),
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), or
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com). After installation, `sh` must be
available in the `PATH` of the shell you want to to invoke `just` from.

If you&#039;d rather not install `sh`, you can use the `shell` setting to use the
shell of your choice.

Like PowerShell:

```just
# use PowerShell instead of sh:
set shell := [&quot;powershell.exe&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;]

hello:
  Write-Host &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
```

…or `cmd.exe`:

```just
# use cmd.exe instead of sh:
set shell := [&quot;cmd.exe&quot;, &quot;/c&quot;]

list:
  dir
```

You can also set the shell using command-line arguments. For example, to use
PowerShell, launch `just` with `--shell powershell.exe --shell-arg -c`.

(PowerShell is installed by default on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2
S1 and later, and `cmd.exe` is quite fiddly, so PowerShell is recommended for
most Windows users.)

### Packages

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

### Pre-Built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows can be found on
[the releases page](https://github.com/casey/just/releases).

You can use the following command on Linux, MacOS, or Windows to download the
latest release, just replace `DEST` with the directory where you&#039;d like to put
`just`:

```console
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to DEST
```

For example, to install `just` to `~/bin`:

```console
# create ~/bin
mkdir -p ~/bin

# download and extract just to ~/bin/just
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/bin

# add `~/bin` to the paths that your shell searches for executables
# this line should be added to your shells initialization file,
# e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$HOME/bin&quot;

# just should now be executable
just --help
```

Note that `install.sh` may fail on GitHub Actions, or in other environments
where many machines share IP addresses. `install.sh` calls GitHub APIs in order
to determine the latest version of `just` to install, and those API calls are
rate-limited on a per-IP basis. To make `install.sh` more reliable in such
circumstances, pass a specific tag to install with `--tag`.

Another way to avoid rate-limiting is to pass a GitHub authentication token to
`install.sh` as an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN`, allowing it to
authenticate its requests.

[Releases](https://github.com/casey/just/releases) include a `SHA256SUM` file
which can be used to verify the integrity of pre-built binary archives.

To verify a release, download the pre-built binary archive along with the
`SHA256SUM` file and run:

```sh
shasum --algorithm 256 --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS
```

### GitHub Actions

`just` can be installed on GitHub Actions in a few ways.

Using package managers pre-installed on GitHub Actions runners on MacOS with
`brew install just`, and on Windows with `choco install just`.

With [extractions/setup-just](https://github.com/extractions/setup-just):

```yaml
- uses: extractions/setup-just@v3
  with:
    just-version: 1.5.0  # optional semver specification, otherwise latest
```

Or with [taiki-e/install-action](https://github.com/taiki-e/install-action):

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/install-action@just
```

### Release RSS Feed

An [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of `just` releases is available [here](https://github.com/casey/just/releases.atom).

### Node.js Installation

[just-install](https://npmjs.com/package/just-install) can be used to automate
installation of `just` in Node.js applications.

`just` is a great, more robust alternative to npm scripts. If you want to
include `just` in the dependencies of a Node.js application, `just-install`
will install a local, platform-specific binary as part of the `npm install`
command. This removes the need for every developer to install `just`
independently using one of the processes mentioned above. After installation,
the `just` command will work in npm scripts or with npx. It&#039;s great for teams
who want to make the set up process for their project as easy as possible.

For more information, see the
[just-install README file](https://github.com/brombal/just-install#readme).

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

With the release of version 1.0, `just` features a strong commitment to
backwards compatibility and stability.

Future releases will not introduce backwards incompatible changes that make
existing `justfile`s stop working, or break working invocations of the
command-line interface.

This does not, however, preclude fixing outright bugs, even if doing so might
break `justfiles` that rely on their behavior.

There will never be a `just` 2.0. Any desirable backwards-incompatible changes
will be opt-in on a per-`justfile` basis, so users may migrate at their
leisure.

Features that aren&#039;t yet ready for stabilization are marked as unstable and may
be changed or removed at any time. Using unstable features produces an error by
default, which can be suppressed with by passing the `--unstable` flag,
`set unstable`, or setting the environment variable `JUST_UNSTABLE`, to any
value other than `false`, `0`, or the empty string.

Editor Support
--------------

`justfile` syntax is close enough to `make` that you may want to tell your
editor to use `make` syntax highlighting for `just`.

### Vim and Neovim

Vim version 9.1.1042 or better and Neovim version 0.11 or better support
Justfile syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to
[pbnj](https://github.com/pbnj).

#### `vim-just`

The [vim-just](https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just) plugin provides syntax
highlighting for `justfile`s.

Install it with your favorite package manager, like
[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
call plug#begin()

Plug &#039;NoahTheDuke/vim-just&#039;

call plug#end()
```

Or with Vim&#039;s built-in package support:

```console
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start
git clone https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just.git
```

#### `tree-sitter-just`

[tree-sitter-just](https://github.com/IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just) is an
[Nvim Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) plugin
for Neovim.

#### Makefile Syntax Highlighting

Vim&#039;s built-in makefile syntax highlighting isn&#039;t perfect for `justfile`s, but
it&#039;s better than nothing. You can put the following in `~/.vim/filetype.vim`:

```vimscript
if exists(&quot;did_load_filetypes&quot;)
  finish
endif

augroup filetypedetect
  au BufNewFile,BufRead justfile setf make
augroup END
```

Or add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on a
per-file basis:

```text
# vim: set ft=make :
```

### Emacs

[just-mode](https://github.com/leon-barrett/just-mode.el) provides syntax
highlighting and automatic indentation of `justfile`s. It is available on
[MELPA](https://melpa.org/) as [just-mode](https://melpa.org/#/just-mode).

[justl](https://github.com/psibi/justl.el) provides commands for executing and
listing recipes.

You can add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on
a per-file basis:

```text
# Local Variables:
# mode: makefile
# End:
```

### Visual Studio Code

An extension for VS Code is [available here](https://github.com/nefrob/vscode-just).

Unmaintained VS Code extensions include
[skellock/vscode-just](https://github.com/skellock/vscode-just) and
[sclu1034/vscode-just](https://github.com/sclu1034/vscode-just).

### JetBrains IDEs

A plugin for JetBrains IDEs by [linux_china](https://github.com/linux-china) is
[available here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18658-just).

### Kakoune

Kakoune supports `justfile` syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to
TeddyDD.

### Helix

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) supports `justfile` syntax highlighting
out-of-the-box since version 23.05.

### Sublime Text

The [Just package](https://github.com/nk9/just_sublime) by
[nk9](https://github.com/nk9) with `just` syntax and some other tools is
available on [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Just).

### Micro

[Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) supports Justfile syntax highlighting
out of the box, thanks to [tomodachi94](https://github.com/tomodachi94).

### Zed

The [zed-just](https://github.com/jackTabsCode/zed-just/) extension by
[jackTabsCode](https://github.com/jackTabsCode) is avilable on the
[Zed extensions page](https://zed.dev/extensions?query=just).

### Other Editors

Feel free to send me the commands necessary to get syntax highlighting working
in your editor of choice so that I may include them here.

### Model Context Protocol

[just-mcp](http://github.com/promptexecution/just-mcp) provides a
[model context protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol)
adapter to allow LLMs to query the contents of `justfiles` and run recipes.

Quick Start
-----------

See the installation section for how to install `just` on your computer. Try
running `just --version` to make sure that it&#039;s installed correctly.

## Features

* Connecting to and serving WebSockets from command line.
* Executing external program and making it communicate to WebSocket using stdin/stdout.
* Text and binary modes, converting between lines (or null-terminated records) and messages.
* Inetd mode, UNIX sockets (including abstract namespaced on Linux).
* Integration with Nginx using TCP or UNIX sockets.
* Directly using unauthenticated SOCKS5 servers for connecting to WebSockets and listening WebSocket connection.
* Auto-reconnect and connection-reuse modes.
* Linux, Windows and Mac support, with [pre-built executables][releases].
* Low-level WebSocket clients and servers with overridable underlying transport connection, e.g. calling external program to serve as a transport for websocat (for SSL, proxying, etc.).

[releases]:https://github.com/vi/websocat/releases

# Installation

There are multiple options for installing WebSocat. From easy to hard:

## FreeBSD

`pkg install websocat`

## Debian / Ubuntu
* Download a pre-build executable from [GitHub releases][releases].
* Websocat is not yet officially packaged for Debian. Some older versions of Websocat may also have Debian package files available on Github releases.

## macOS

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh): `brew install websocat`

[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org): `sudo port install websocat`

## From source
* Install the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and do `cargo install websocat`. If something fails with a `-sys` crate, try with `--no-default-features`;
* Build Websocat from source code (see below), then move `target/release/websocat` somewhere to the PATH.

## Pre-built binaries
Pre-built binaries for Linux (usual and musl), Windows, OS X and Android are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/vi/websocat/releases).


Building from source code
---

1. Install the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/). Note that Websocat v1 (i.e. the current stable version) may fail to support too new Rust due to its old dependencies which can be broken by e.g. [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78802).
2. `cargo build --release`.
3. Find the executable somewhere under `target/`, e.g. in `target/release/websocat`.

### Rust versions


|Websocat versions|Minimal Rust version|Maximal Rust version|
|----|----|----|
| 4.0.0-alpha1 | 1.84 | ?   |
| 1.12+     | ?    | ?          |
| 1.9 - 1.11| 1.46 | maybe 1.63 |
| 1.6 - 1.8 | 1.34 | maybe 1.63  |
| 1.3 - 1.5 | 1.31 | 1.47? |
| 1.2       | 1.28 | 1.47? |
| 1.0-1.1   | 1.23 | 1.47? |
| 1.2       | ?    | ?     |

Note that building with legacy Rust version (e.g. 1.46) may require manually copying `Cargo.lock.legacy` to `Cargo.lock` prior to the building.

Early non-async versions of Websocat should be buildable by even older rustc.  

Note that old versions of Websocat may misbehave if built by Rust 1.48 or later due to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71274/.

It may be not a good idea to build v1.x line of Websocat with Rust 1.64 due to [IP address representation refactor]. It may expose previously hidden undefined behaviour in legacy dependencies. (In practice, it seems to just work though - but a lot of time passed since I checked Websocat properly and in detail).

[ipaddr]:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78802


SSL on Android
---

websocat&#039;s `wss://` may fail on Android. As a workaround, download certificate bundle, for example, from https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem and specify it explicitly:

    SSL_CERT_FILE=cacert.pem /data/local/tmp/websocat wss://echo.websocket.org

Or just use `--insecure` option.

Documentation
---

Basic usage examples are provided at the top of this README and in `--help` message. More tricks are described in [moreexamples.md](./moreexamples.md).

There is a [list of all address types and overlays](doc.md).

Why do ML/AI in Postgres?

Data for ML &amp; AI systems is inherently larger and more dynamic than the models. It&#039;s more efficient, manageable and reliable to move models to the database, rather than constantly moving data to the models.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

# Getting started

The only prerequisites for using PostgresML is a Postgres database with our open-source `pgml` extension installed.

## PostgresML Cloud

Our serverless cloud is the easiest and recommend way to get started.

[Sign up for a free PostgresML account](https://postgresml.org/signup). You&#039;ll get a free database in seconds, with access to GPUs and state of the art LLMs.

## Self-hosted

If you don&#039;t want to use our cloud you can self host it.

```
docker run \
    -it \
    -v postgresml_data:/var/lib/postgresql \
    -p 5433:5432 \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    ghcr.io/postgresml/postgresml:2.10.0 \
    sudo -u postgresml psql -d postgresml
```

For more details, take a look at our [Quick Start with Docker](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/developers/quick-start-with-docker) documentation.

## Ecosystem

We have a number of other tools and libraries that are specifically designed to work with PostgreML. Remeber PostgresML is a postgres extension running inside of Postgres so you can connect with `psql` and use any of your favorite tooling and client libraries like [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/) to connect and run queries.

&lt;b&gt;PostgresML Specific Client Libraries:&lt;/b&gt;
- [Korvus](https://github.com/postgresml/korvus) - Korvus is a Python, JavaScript, Rust and C search SDK that unifies the entire RAG pipeline in a single database query.
- [postgresml-django](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml-django) - postgresml-django is a Python module that integrates PostgresML with Django ORM.

&lt;b&gt;Recommended Postgres Poolers:&lt;/b&gt;
- [pgcat](https://github.com/postgresml/pgcat) - pgcat is a PostgreSQL pooler with sharding, load balancing and failover support.

# Large language models

PostgresML brings models directly to your data, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming data transfers. This approach significantly enhances performance, security, and scalability for AI-driven applications.

By running models within the database, PostgresML enables:

- Reduced latency and improved query performance
- Enhanced data privacy and security
- Simplified infrastructure management
- Seamless integration with existing database operations

## Hugging Face

PostgresML supports a wide range of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures available on the Hugging Face [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). This integration allows you to:

- Access thousands of pre-trained models
- Utilize cutting-edge NLP, computer vision, and other AI models
- Easily experiment with different architectures

## OpenAI and other providers

While cloud-based LLM providers offer powerful capabilities, making API calls from within the database can introduce latency, security risks, and potential compliance issues. Currently, PostgresML does not directly support integration with remote LLM providers like OpenAI.

# RAG

PostgresML transforms your PostgreSQL database into a powerful vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It leverages pgvector for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.

Our RAG implementation is built on four key SQL functions:

1. [Chunk](#chunk): Splits text into manageable segments
2. [Embed](#embed): Generates vector embeddings from text using pre-trained models
3. [Rank](#rank): Performs similarity search on embeddings
4. [Transform](#transform): Applies language models for text generation or transformation

For more information on using RAG with PostgresML see our guide on [Unified RAG](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/guides/unified-rag).

## Chunk

The `pgml.chunk` function chunks documents using the specified splitter. This is typically done before embedding.

```postgresql
pgml.chunk(
    splitter TEXT,    -- splitter name
    text TEXT,        -- text to embed
    kwargs JSON       -- optional arguments (see below)
)
```

See [pgml.chunk docs](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/api/pgml.chunk) for more information.

## Embed

The `pgml.embed` function generates embeddings from text using in-database models.

```postgresql
pgml.embed(
    transformer TEXT,
    &quot;text&quot; TEXT,
    kwargs JSONB
)
```
See [pgml.embed docs](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/api/pgml.embed) for more information.

## Rank

The `pgml.rank` function uses [Cross-Encoders](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html) to score sentence pairs.

This is typically used as a re-ranking step when performing search.

```postgresl
pgml.rank(
    transformer TEXT,
    query TEXT,
    documents TEXT[],
    kwargs JSONB
)
```

Docs coming soon.

## Transform

The `pgml.transform` function can be used to generate text.

```postgresql
SELECT pgml.transform(
    task   =&gt; TEXT OR JSONB,     -- Pipeline initializer arguments
    inputs =&gt; TEXT[] OR BYTEA[], -- inputs for inference
    args   =&gt; JSONB              -- (optional) arguments to the pipeline.
)
```

See [pgml.transform docs](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/api/pgml.transform) for more information.

See our [Text Generation guide](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/guides/llms/text-generation) for a guide on generating text.

# Machine learning

&lt;b&gt;Some highlights:&lt;/b&gt;
- [47+ classification and regression algorithms](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/api/pgml.train)
- [8 - 40X faster inference than HTTP based model serving](https://postgresml.org/blog/postgresml-is-8x-faster-than-python-http-microservices)
- [Millions of transactions per second](https://postgresml.org/blog/scaling-postgresml-to-one-million-requests-per-second)
- [Horizontal scalability](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgcat/)

**Training a classification model**

*Training*
```postgresql
SELECT * FROM pgml.train(
    &#039;Handwritten Digit Image Classifier&#039;,
    algorithm =&gt; &#039;xgboost&#039;,
    &#039;classification&#039;,
    &#039;pgml.digits&#039;,
    &#039;target&#039;
);
```

*Inference*
```postgresql
SELECT pgml.predict(
    &#039;My Classification Project&#039;,
    ARRAY[0.1, 2.0, 5.0]
) AS prediction;
```

## NLP

The `pgml.transform` function exposes a number of available NLP tasks.

Available tasks are:
- [Text Classification](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/guides/llms/text-classification)
- [Zero-Shot Classification](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/guides/llms/zero-shot-classification)

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we use Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we&#039;ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:

-   We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    -   Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    -   Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
-   We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3, 2024,the last beta release.
-   We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4, 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
-   We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28, 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
-   We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) on June 20, 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and we do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth documentation](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

-   Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
-   See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.88.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/06/26/Rust-1.88.0/).

See the docs for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [docs][book].

If the answer is not there:

-   Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or
-   Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

-   [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
-   [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
-   [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80). Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ — the state of your application
* __Messages__ — user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ — a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ — a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(&quot;A cool counter&quot;, Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

Read the [book], the [documentation], and the [examples] to learn more!

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

HelixDB was built on the thesis that current database infrastructure is built for how humans think about data, not AI. So we&#039;ve built a database that makes it easy to build all the components needed for an AI application in a single platform.

You no longer need a separate application DB, vector DB, graph DB, or application layers to manage the multiple storage locations. All you need to build any application that uses AI, agents or RAG, is a single HelixDB cluster and HelixQL; we take care of the rest.

HelixDB primarily operates with a graph + vector data model, but it can also support support KV, documents, and relational data.

## Key Features

|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Built-in MCP tools**           | Helix has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than having to generate human readable queries, letting agents actually think. |
| **Built-in Embeddings**          | Don&#039;t worry about needing to embed your data before sending it to Helix, just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text.                                                     |
| **Tooling for Knowledge Graphs** | It is super easy to ingest your unstructured data into a knowledge graph, with our integrations for Zep-AI&#039;s Graphiti, and our own implementation of OpenAI&#039;s KG tool.        |
| **Tooling for RAG**              | HelixDB has a built-in vector search, keyword search, and hybrid search that can be used to power your RAG applications.                                                      |
| **Secure by Default**            | HelixDB is private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled HelixQL queries.                                                                           |
| **Logical Isolation**            | Each Helix cluster is logically isolated in its own VPC meaning only you can ever see your data.                                                                              |
| **Ultra-Low Latency**            | Helix is built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.                                                                                |

## Getting Started

#### Helix CLI

The Helix CLI tool can be used to check, compile and deploy Helix locally.

1. Install CLI

   ```bash
   curl -sSL &quot;https://install.helix-db.com&quot; | bash
   ```

2. Install Helix

   ```bash
   helix install
   ```

3. Setup

   ```bash
   helix init --path &lt;path-to-project&gt;
   ```

4. Write queries

   Open your newly created `.hx` files and start writing your schema and queries.
   Head over to [our docs](https://docs.helix-db.com/introduction/cookbook/basic) for more information about writing queries

   ```js
   QUERY addUser(name: String, age: I64) =&gt;
      user &lt;- AddN&lt;User&gt;({name: name, age: age})
      RETURN user

   QUERY getUser(user_name: String) =&gt;
      user &lt;- N&lt;User&gt;::WHERE(_::{name}::EQ(user_name))
      RETURN user
   ```

5. Check your queries compile before building them into API endpoints (optional)

   ```bash
   # in ./&lt;path-to-project&gt;
   helix check
   ```

6. Deploy your queries

   ```bash
   # in ./&lt;path-to-project&gt;
   helix deploy
   ```

7. Start calling them using our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-ts) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py). For example:

   ```typescript
   import HelixDB from &quot;helix-ts&quot;;

   // Create a new HelixDB client
   // The default port is 6969
   const client = new HelixDB();

   // Query the database
   await client.query(&quot;addUser&quot;, {
     name: &quot;John&quot;,
     age: 20,
   });

   // Get the created user
   const user = await client.query(&quot;getUser&quot;, {
     user_name: &quot;John&quot;,
   });

   console.log(user);
   ```

Other commands:

- `helix instances` to see all your local instances.
- `helix stop &lt;instance-id&gt;` to stop your local instance with specified id.
- `helix stop --all` to stop all your local instances.
- `helix dockerdev run` to start a Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev status` to check the Docker development instance status.
- `helix dockerdev logs` to view Docker container logs.
- `helix dockerdev stop` to stop the Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev delete` to remove the Docker development instance and data.

## Roadmap

Our current focus areas include:

- Organizational auth to manage teams, and Helix clusters.
- Improvements to our server code to massively improve network IO performance and scalability.
- More 3rd party integrations to make it easier to build with Helix.
- Guides and educational content to help you get started with Helix.
- Binary quantisation for even better performance.

Long term projects:

- In-house SOTA knowledge graph ingestion tool for any data source.
- In-house graph-vector storage engine (to replace LMDB)
- In-house network protocol &amp; serdes libraries (similar to protobufs/gRPC)

## About

### What is FHEVM?

**FHEVM** is the core framework of the *Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol*. It enables confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing encrypted data to be processed directly onchain.

FHEVM ensures both confidentiality and composability, with the following guarantees:
- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn&#039;t impact existing dApps.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Project structure
The directories of this repository are organized in the following way:

###### FHEVM Contracts

- **`gateway-contracts/`**: Smart contracts managing the gateway between on-chain and off-chain components.

- **`host-contracts/`**: Smart Contracts deployed on the host chain for orchestrating FHE workflows.

###### FHEVM Compute Engines

- **`coprocessor/`**: Rust-based coprocessor implementation for FHE operations.

- **`kms-connector/`**: Interface for integrating with Key Management Services (KMS) to handle encryption keys securely.

###### FHEVM Utilities
- **`charts/`**: Helm charts and deployment configurations for the stack.

- **`golden-container-images/`**: Docker golden images for Node.js and Rust environments used as base images by the stack.

- **`test-suite/`**: Integration with docker-compose and tests covering end-to-end FHEVM stack behavior.



  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
### Main features

- **Privacy by design:** Building decentralized apps with full privacy and confidentiality on Ethereum, leveraging FHE.
- **Solidity integration:** Write FHEVM contracts like any standard Solidity contract using Solidity. Compatible with existing toolchains — such as Hardhat and Foundry (*coming soon*).
- **Programmable privacy:**  Define exactly what data is encrypted and write the access control logic directly in your smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers.
- **Full range of operators:** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, ternary-if, boolean operations…. Consecutive FHE operations are not limited.
- **Security:** The underlying FHE crypto-scheme of FHEVM is quantum-resistant. Decryption is managed via a key management system (KMS) using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring security even if some parties are compromised or misbehaving.
- **Symbolic execution of FHE computations:** All FHE operations are executed symbolically on the host chain, significantly reducing execution time. The actual computations on encrypted data are offloaded asynchronously to our coprocessor, allowing for faster, efficient, and scalable processing.

_Learn more about FHEVM features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) and in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/fhevm-whitepaper.pdf)._
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Use cases

FHEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without the need to learn cryptography. Leveraging FHEVM, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFi, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Confidential transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.
- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.

## 🧠 Why Terminator

### For Developers

- Create automations that work across any desktop app or browser
- Runs 100x faster than ChatGPT Agents, Claude, Perplexity Comet, BrowserBase, BrowserUse
- \&gt;95% success rate without costly consultant armies (UIPath, Automation Anywhere)
- MIT-licensed — fork it, ship it, no lock-in

We achieve this by pre-training workflows as deterministic code, and calling AI only when recovery is needed.

### For Teams

[Our private beta workflow builder](https://www.mediar.ai/) + managed hosting = plug-and-play automation engine for your business:

- Record &amp; map your processes in days
- Deploy AI to execute them at &gt;95% accuracy
- Kill repetitive work without legacy RPA complexity or cost

## ⚡ Quick start: MCP

Install the Terminator MCP in Claude Code with one command:

```bash
claude mcp add terminator &quot;npx -y terminator-mcp-agent&quot; -s user
```

Or install via the [MCP directory](https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator/tree/main/terminator-mcp-agent) for other clients.

## ⚡ Quick start: programmatic control

### 🐍 Python

```python
import terminator

# Control applications programmatically
desktop = terminator.Desktop()
desktop.open_application(&#039;calc&#039;)
desktop.locator(&#039;name:Seven&#039;).click()
desktop.locator(&#039;name:Plus&#039;).click()
desktop.locator(&#039;name:Three&#039;).click()
desktop.locator(&#039;name:Equals&#039;).click()
# Result: 10 appears in calculator
```

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install terminator.py
```

### 🟦 TypeScript / Node.js

```typescript
const { Desktop } = require(&quot;terminator.js&quot;);

// Async/await for modern control flow
const desktop = new Desktop();
await desktop.openApplication(&quot;notepad&quot;);
await desktop.locator(&quot;name:Edit&quot;).typeText(&quot;Hello from TypeScript!&quot;);
await desktop.pressKey(&quot;{Ctrl}s&quot;); // Save
```

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install terminator.js
# or: bun add terminator.js
```

## 🕵️ How to Inspect Accessibility Elements (like `name:Seven`)

To create reliable selectors (e.g. `name:Seven`, `role:Button`, `window:Calculator`), you need to inspect the Accessibility Tree of your OS. Here&#039;s how to explore UI elements on each platform:

### 🪟 Windows

- **Tool:** [Accessibility Insights for Windows](https://accessibilityinsights.io/downloads/)
- **Alt:** [Inspect.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/inspect-objects) (comes with Windows SDK)
- **Usage:** Open the app you want to inspect → launch Accessibility Insights → hover or use keyboard navigation to explore the UI tree (Name, Role, ControlType, AutomationId).

&gt; These tools show you the `Name`, `Role`, `ControlType`, and other metadata used in Terminator selectors.

---

### 🍎 macOS

- **Tool:** [Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/accessibility_inspector)
- **Usage:** Comes with Xcode → Open `Xcode &gt; Open Developer Tool &gt; Accessibility Inspector` → Use the target icon to explore UI elements on screen.

---

### 🐧 Linux

- **Tool:** [Accerciser](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Accerciser)
- **Install:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt install accerciser
  ```

- **Usage:** Launch Accerciser → Select the window/app → Browse the accessible widget tree.

---

### 💡 Tip

Once you identify the structure of your UI:

```python
# Sample pattern
desktop.locator(&#039;window:Calculator&#039;)
       .locator(&#039;role:Button&#039;)
       .locator(&#039;name:Seven&#039;)
```

You can build and debug selector paths incrementally using `.locator()` chaining.

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

## Contributing

Before you start working on something, it&#039;s best to check if there is an existing issue first. It&#039;s also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

Thank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!

### Documentation

Documentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation in the Rust &amp; JS source code as much as possible. Check out the hosting repository for the documentation site for further information: &lt;https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs&gt;
