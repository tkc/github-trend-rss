## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex  # Alternatively: `brew install codex`
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. You&#039;ll need a Plus, Pro, or Team ChatGPT account, and will get access to our latest models, including `gpt-5`, at no extra cost to your plan. (Enterprise is coming soon.)

&gt; Important: If you&#039;ve used the Codex CLI before, follow these steps to migrate from usage-based billing with your API key:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Update the CLI and ensure `codex --version` is `0.20.0` or later
&gt; 2. Delete `~/.codex/auth.json` (this should be `C:\Users\USERNAME\.codex\auth.json` on Windows)
&gt; 3. Run `codex login` again

If you encounter problems with the login flow, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Connecting on a &quot;Headless&quot; Machine

Today, the login process entails running a server on `localhost:1455`. If you are on a &quot;headless&quot; server, such as a Docker container or are `ssh`&#039;d into a remote machine, loading `localhost:1455` in the browser on your local machine will not automatically connect to the webserver running on the _headless_ machine, so you must use one of the following workarounds:

#### Authenticate locally and copy your credentials to the &quot;headless&quot; machine

The easiest solution is likely to run through the `codex login` process on your local machine such that `localhost:1455` _is_ accessible in your web browser. When you complete the authentication process, an `auth.json` file should be available at `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` (on Mac/Linux, `$CODEX_HOME` defaults to `~/.codex` whereas on Windows, it defaults to `%USERPROFILE%\.codex`).

Because the `auth.json` file is not tied to a specific host, once you complete the authentication flow locally, you can copy the `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` file to the headless machine and then `codex` should &quot;just work&quot; on that machine. Note to copy a file to a Docker container, you can do:

```shell
# substitute MY_CONTAINER with the name or id of your Docker container:
CONTAINER_HOME=$(docker exec MY_CONTAINER printenv HOME)
docker exec MY_CONTAINER mkdir -p &quot;$CONTAINER_HOME/.codex&quot;
docker cp auth.json MY_CONTAINER:&quot;$CONTAINER_HOME/.codex/auth.json&quot;
```

whereas if you are `ssh`&#039;d into a remote machine, you likely want to use [`scp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol):

```shell
ssh user@remote &#039;mkdir -p ~/.codex&#039;
scp ~/.codex/auth.json user@remote:~/.codex/auth.json
```

or try this one-liner:

```shell
ssh user@remote &#039;mkdir -p ~/.codex &amp;&amp; cat &gt; ~/.codex/auth.json&#039; &lt; ~/.codex/auth.json
```

#### Connecting through VPS or remote

If you run Codex on a remote machine (VPS/server) without a local browser, the login helper starts a server on `localhost:1455` on the remote host. To complete login in your local browser, forward that port to your machine before starting the login flow:

```bash
# From your local machine
ssh -L 1455:localhost:1455 &lt;user&gt;@&lt;remote-host&gt;
```

Then, in that SSH session, run `codex` and select &quot;Sign in with ChatGPT&quot;. When prompted, open the printed URL (it will be `http://localhost:1455/...`) in your local browser. The traffic will be tunneled to the remote server.

### Usage-based billing alternative: Use an OpenAI API key

If you prefer to pay-as-you-go, you can still authenticate with your OpenAI API key by setting it as an environment variable:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
```

Notes:

- This command only sets the key for your current terminal session, which we recommend. To set it for all future sessions, you can also add the `export` line to your shell&#039;s configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`).
- If you have signed in with ChatGPT, Codex will default to using your ChatGPT credits. If you wish to use your API key, use the `/logout` command to clear your ChatGPT authentication.

### Choosing Codex&#039;s level of autonomy

We always recommend running Codex in its default sandbox that gives you strong guardrails around what the agent can do. The default sandbox prevents it from editing files outside its workspace, or from accessing the network.

When you launch Codex in a new folder, it detects whether the folder is version controlled and recommends one of two levels of autonomy:

#### **1. Read/write**

- Codex can run commands and write files in the workspace without approval.
- To write files in other folders, access network, update git or perform other actions protected by the sandbox, Codex will need your permission.
- By default, the workspace includes the current directory, as well as temporary directories like `/tmp`. You can see what directories are in the workspace with the `/status` command. See the docs for how to customize this behavior.
- Advanced: You can manually specify this configuration by running `codex --sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval on-request`
- This is the recommended default for version-controlled folders.

#### **2. Read-only**

- Codex can run read-only commands without approval.
- To edit files, access network, or perform other actions protected by the sandbox, Codex will need your permission.
- Advanced: You can manually specify this configuration by running `codex --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request`
- This is the recommended default non-version-controlled folders.

#### **3. Advanced configuration**

Codex gives you fine-grained control over the sandbox with the `--sandbox` option, and over when it requests approval with the `--ask-for-approval` option. Run `codex help` for more on these options.

#### Can I run without ANY approvals?

Yes, run codex non-interactively with `--ask-for-approval never`. This option works with all `--sandbox` options, so you still have full control over Codex&#039;s level of autonomy. It will make its best attempt with whatever contrainsts you provide. For example:

- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox read-only` when you are running many agents to answer questions in parallel in the same workspace.
- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox workspace-write` when you want the agent to non-interactively take time to produce the best outcome, with strong guardrails around its behavior.
- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox danger-full-access` to dangerously give the agent full autonomy. Because this disables important safety mechanisms, we recommend against using this unless running Codex in an isolated environment.

#### Fine-tuning in `config.toml`

```toml
# approval mode
approval_policy = &quot;untrusted&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;read-only&quot;

# full-auto mode
approval_policy = &quot;on-request&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;workspace-write&quot;

# Optional: allow network in workspace-write mode
[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

You can also save presets as **profiles**:

```toml
[profiles.full_auto]
approval_policy = &quot;on-request&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;workspace-write&quot;

[profiles.readonly_quiet]
approval_policy = &quot;never&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;read-only&quot;
```

### Example prompts

Below are a few bite-size examples you can copy-paste. Replace the text in quotes with your own task. See the [prompting guide](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-cli/examples/prompting_guide.md) for more tips and usage patterns.

| ✨  | What you type                                                                   | What happens                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `codex &quot;Refactor the Dashboard component to React Hooks&quot;`                       | Codex rewrites the class component, runs `npm test`, and shows the diff.   |
| 2   | `codex &quot;Generate SQL migrations for adding a users table&quot;`                      | Infers your ORM, creates migration files, and runs them in a sandboxed DB. |
| 3   | `codex &quot;Write unit tests for utils/date.ts&quot;`                                    | Generates tests, executes them, and iterates until they pass.              |
| 4   | `codex &quot;Bulk-rename *.jpeg -&gt; *.jpg with git mv&quot;`                               | Safely renames files and updates imports/usages.                           |
| 5   | `codex &quot;Explain what this regex does: ^(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}$&quot;`                      | Outputs a step-by-step human explanation.                                  |
| 6   | `codex &quot;Carefully review this repo, and propose 3 high impact well-scoped PRs&quot;` | Suggests impactful PRs in the current codebase.                            |
| 7   | `codex &quot;Look for vulnerabilities and create a security review report&quot;`          | Finds and explains security bugs.                                          |

## Running with a prompt as input

You can also run Codex CLI with a prompt as input:

```shell
codex &quot;explain this codebase to me&quot;
```

```shell
codex --full-auto &quot;create the fanciest todo-list app&quot;
```

That&#039;s it - Codex will scaffold a file, run it inside a sandbox, install any
missing dependencies, and show you the live result. Approve the changes and
they&#039;ll be committed to your working directory.

## Using Open Source Models

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;--profile&lt;/code&gt; to use other models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Codex also allows you to use other providers that support the OpenAI Chat Completions (or Responses) API.

To do so, you must first define custom [providers](./config.md#model_providers) in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For example, the provider for a standard Ollama setup would be defined as follows:

```toml
[model_providers.ollama]
name = &quot;Ollama&quot;
base_url = &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1&quot;
```

The `base_url` will have `/chat/completions` appended to it to build the full URL for the request.

For providers that also require an `Authorization` header of the form `Bearer: SECRET`, an `env_key` can be specified, which indicates the environment variable to read to use as the value of `SECRET` when making a request:

```toml
[model_providers.openrouter]
name = &quot;OpenRouter&quot;
base_url = &quot;https://openrouter.ai/api/v1&quot;
env_key = &quot;OPENROUTER_API_KEY&quot;
```

Providers that speak the Responses API are also supported by adding `wire_api = &quot;responses&quot;` as part of the definition. Accessing OpenAI models via Azure is an example of such a provider, though it also requires specifying additional `query_params` that need to be appended to the request URL:

```toml
[model_providers.azure]
name = &quot;Azure&quot;
# Make sure you set the appropriate subdomain for this URL.
base_url = &quot;https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai&quot;
env_key = &quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;  # Or &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;, whichever you use.
# Newer versions appear to support the responses API, see https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/1321
query_params = { api-version = &quot;2025-04-01-preview&quot; }
wire_api = &quot;responses&quot;
```

Once you have defined a provider you wish to use, you can configure it as your default provider as follows:

```toml
model_provider = &quot;azure&quot;
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you find yourself experimenting with a variety of models and providers, then you likely want to invest in defining a _profile_ for each configuration like so:

```toml
[profiles.o3]
model_provider = &quot;azure&quot;
model = &quot;o3&quot;

[profiles.mistral]
model_provider = &quot;ollama&quot;
model = &quot;mistral&quot;
```

This way, you can specify one command-line argument (.e.g., `--profile o3`, `--profile mistral`) to override multiple settings together.

&lt;/details&gt;

Codex can run fully locally against an OpenAI-compatible OSS host (like Ollama) using the `--oss` flag:

- Interactive UI:
  - codex --oss
- Non-interactive (programmatic) mode:
  - echo &quot;Refactor utils&quot; | codex exec --oss

Model selection when using `--oss`:

- If you omit `-m/--model`, Codex defaults to -m gpt-oss:20b and will verify it exists locally (downloading if needed).
- To pick a different size, pass one of:
  - -m &quot;gpt-oss:20b&quot;
  - -m &quot;gpt-oss:120b&quot;

Point Codex at your own OSS host:

- By default, `--oss` talks to http://localhost:11434/v1.
- To use a different host, set one of these environment variables before running Codex:
  - CODEX_OSS_BASE_URL, for example:
    - CODEX_OSS_BASE_URL=&quot;http://my-ollama.example.com:11434/v1&quot; codex --oss -m gpt-oss:20b
  - or CODEX_OSS_PORT (when the host is localhost):
    - CODEX_OSS_PORT=11434 codex --oss

Advanced: you can persist this in your config instead of environment variables by overriding the built-in `oss` provider in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[model_providers.oss]
name = &quot;Open Source&quot;
base_url = &quot;http://my-ollama.example.com:11434/v1&quot;
```

### Platform sandboxing details

The mechanism Codex uses to implement the sandbox policy depends on your OS:

- **macOS 12+** uses **Apple Seatbelt** and runs commands using `sandbox-exec` with a profile (`-p`) that corresponds to the `--sandbox` that was specified.
- **Linux** uses a combination of Landlock/seccomp APIs to enforce the `sandbox` configuration.

Note that when running Linux in a containerized environment such as Docker, sandboxing may not work if the host/container configuration does not support the necessary Landlock/seccomp APIs. In such cases, we recommend configuring your Docker container so that it provides the sandbox guarantees you are looking for and then running `codex` with `--sandbox danger-full-access` (or, more simply, the `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` flag) within your container.

---

## Memory &amp; project docs

You can give Codex extra instructions and guidance using `AGENTS.md` files. Codex looks for `AGENTS.md` files in the following places, and merges them top-down:

1. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` - personal global guidance
2. `AGENTS.md` at repo root - shared project notes
3. `AGENTS.md` in the current working directory - sub-folder/feature specifics

---

## Non-interactive / CI mode

Run Codex head-less in pipelines. Example GitHub Action step:

```yaml
- name: Update changelog via Codex
  run: |
    npm install -g @openai/codex
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}&quot;
    codex exec --full-auto &quot;update CHANGELOG for next release&quot;
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Codex CLI can be configured to leverage MCP servers by defining an [`mcp_servers`](./codex-rs/config.md#mcp_servers) section in `~/.codex/config.toml`. It is intended to mirror how tools such as Claude and Cursor define `mcpServers` in their respective JSON config files, though the Codex format is slightly different since it uses TOML rather than JSON, e.g.:

```toml

## About

### What is FHEVM?

**FHEVM** is the core framework of the *Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol*. It enables confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing encrypted data to be processed directly onchain.

FHEVM ensures both confidentiality and composability, with the following guarantees:
- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn&#039;t impact existing dApps.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Project structure
The directories of this repository are organized in the following way:

###### FHEVM Contracts

- **`gateway-contracts/`**: Smart contracts managing the gateway between on-chain and off-chain components.

- **`host-contracts/`**: Smart Contracts deployed on the host chain for orchestrating FHE workflows.

###### FHEVM Compute Engines

- **`coprocessor/`**: Rust-based coprocessor implementation for FHE operations.

- **`kms-connector/`**: Interface for integrating with Key Management Services (KMS) to handle encryption keys securely.

###### FHEVM Utilities
- **`charts/`**: Helm charts and deployment configurations for the stack.

- **`golden-container-images/`**: Docker golden images for Node.js and Rust environments used as base images by the stack.

- **`test-suite/`**: Integration with docker-compose and tests covering end-to-end FHEVM stack behavior.



  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
### Main features

- **Privacy by design:** Building decentralized apps with full privacy and confidentiality on Ethereum, leveraging FHE.
- **Solidity integration:** Write FHEVM contracts like any standard Solidity contract using Solidity. Compatible with existing toolchains — such as Hardhat and Foundry (*coming soon*).
- **Programmable privacy:**  Define exactly what data is encrypted and write the access control logic directly in your smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers.
- **Full range of operators:** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, ternary-if, boolean operations…. Consecutive FHE operations are not limited.
- **Security:** The underlying FHE crypto-scheme of FHEVM is quantum-resistant. Decryption is managed via a key management system (KMS) using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring security even if some parties are compromised or misbehaving.
- **Symbolic execution of FHE computations:** All FHE operations are executed symbolically on the host chain, significantly reducing execution time. The actual computations on encrypted data are offloaded asynchronously to our coprocessor, allowing for faster, efficient, and scalable processing.

_Learn more about FHEVM features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) and in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/fhevm-whitepaper.pdf)._
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Use cases

FHEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without the need to learn cryptography. Leveraging FHEVM, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFi, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Confidential transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.
- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.

# librespot
*librespot* is an open source client library for Spotify. It enables applications to use Spotify&#039;s service to control and play music via various backends, and to act as a Spotify Connect receiver. It is an alternative to the official and [now deprecated](https://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/#libspotify-s-deprecation) closed-source `libspotify`. Additionally, it will provide extra features which are not available in the official library.

_Note: librespot only works with Spotify Premium. This will remain the case. We will not support any features to make librespot compatible with free accounts, such as limited skips and adverts._

## Quick start
We&#039;re available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/librespot) as the _librespot_ package. Simply run `cargo install librespot` to install librespot on your system. Check the wiki for more info and possible [usage options](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).

After installation, you can run librespot from the CLI using a command such as `librespot -n &quot;Librespot Speaker&quot; -b 160` to create a speaker called _Librespot Speaker_ serving 160 kbps audio.

## This fork
As the origin by [plietar](https://github.com/plietar/) is no longer actively maintained, this organisation and repository have been set up so that the project may be maintained and upgraded in the future.

# Documentation
Documentation is currently a work in progress, contributions are welcome!

There is some brief documentation on how the protocol works in the [docs](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/tree/master/docs) folder.

[COMPILING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/COMPILING.md) contains detailed instructions on setting up a development environment, and compiling librespot. More general usage and compilation information is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki).
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) also contains our contributing guidelines.

If you wish to learn more about how librespot works overall, the best way is to simply read the code, and ask any questions you have in our [Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/librespot-org/spotify-connect-resources).

# Issues &amp; Discussions
**We have recently started using Github discussions for general questions and feature requests, as they are a more natural medium for such cases, and allow for upvoting to prioritize feature development. Check them out [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/discussions). Bugs and issues with the underlying library should still be reported as issues.**

If you run into a bug when using librespot, please search the existing issues before opening a new one. Chances are, we&#039;ve encountered it before, and have provided a resolution. If not, please open a new one, and where possible, include the backtrace librespot generates on crashing, along with anything we can use to reproduce the issue, e.g. the Spotify URI of the song that caused the crash.

# Building
A quick walkthrough of the build process is outlined below, while a detailed compilation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/COMPILING.md).

## Additional Dependencies
We recently switched to using [Rodio](https://github.com/tomaka/rodio) for audio playback by default, hence for macOS and Windows, you should just be able to clone and build librespot (with the command below).
For Linux, you will need to run the additional commands below, depending on your distro.

On Debian/Ubuntu, the following command will install these dependencies:
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev
```

On Fedora systems, the following command will install these dependencies:
```shell
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel make gcc
```

librespot currently offers the following selection of [audio backends](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends):
```
Rodio (default)
ALSA
GStreamer
PortAudio
PulseAudio
JACK
JACK over Rodio
SDL
Pipe
Subprocess
```
Please check the corresponding [Compiling](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies) entry on the wiki for backend specific dependencies.

Once you&#039;ve installed the dependencies and cloned this repository you can build *librespot* with the default backend using Cargo.
```shell
cargo build --release
```

# Packages

librespot is also available via official package system on various operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD. [Repology](https://repology.org/project/librespot/versions) offers a good overview.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/librespot.svg)](https://repology.org/project/librespot/versions)

## Usage
A sample program implementing a headless Spotify Connect receiver is provided.
Once you&#039;ve built *librespot*, run it using :
```shell
target/release/librespot --name DEVICENAME
```

The above is a minimal example. Here is a more fully fledged one:
```shell
target/release/librespot -n &quot;Librespot&quot; -b 320 -c ./cache --enable-volume-normalisation --initial-volume 75 --device-type avr
```
The above command will create a receiver named ```Librespot```, with bitrate set to 320 kbps, initial volume at 75%, with volume normalisation enabled, and the device displayed in the app as an Audio/Video Receiver. A folder named ```cache``` will be created/used in the current directory, and be used to cache audio data and credentials.

A full list of runtime options is available [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).

_Please Note: When using the cache feature, an authentication blob is stored for your account in the cache directory. For security purposes, we recommend that you set directory permissions on the cache directory to `700`._

details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ — the state of your application
* __Messages__ — user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ — a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ — a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(&quot;A cool counter&quot;, Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

Read the [book], the [documentation], and the [examples] to learn more!

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Workspaces) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Window-Rules#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Screencasting#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Tabs)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Layout#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: no built-in support, but xwayland-satellite is [easy to set up](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-xwayland-satellite) and works very well.
    - Steam and games, including Proton: work perfectly through xwayland-satellite.
    - JetBrains IDEs, Ghidra: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Discord and other Electron apps: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Chromium and VSCode: work perfectly natively on Wayland with the right flags.
    - X11 apps that want to position windows or bars at specific screen coordinates: won&#039;t work well; you can run them in a nested compositor like [labwc](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-the-labwc-wayland-compositor) or [rootful Xwayland](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#directly-running-xwayland-in-rootful-mode).
    - Display scaling (integer or fractional) keeps X11 apps crisp, but you need the latest xwayland-satellite.
    For games, you can run them in [gamescope] at native resolution, even with display scaling.

## Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [📖 Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

You can find additional [setup and configurations guides](https://getfoundry.sh/config/overview) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs] and in the [config crate](./crates/config/README.md):

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cargo

Cargo downloads your Rust project’s dependencies and compiles your project.

**To start using Cargo**, learn more at [The Cargo Book].

**To start developing Cargo itself**, read the [Cargo Contributor Guide].

[The Cargo Book]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
[Cargo Contributor Guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo/contrib/

&gt; The Cargo binary distributed through with Rust is maintained by the Cargo
&gt; team for use by the wider ecosystem.
&gt; For all other uses of this crate (as a binary or library) this is maintained
&gt; by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo and not intended for external
&gt; use (except as a transitive dependency). This crate may make major changes to
&gt; its APIs.

## Code Status

[![CI](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=auto-cargo)](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Code documentation: &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/&gt;

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `cargo` and `rustc`
* A C compiler [for your platform](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)
* `git` (to clone this repository)

**Other requirements:**

The following are optional based on your platform and needs.

* `pkg-config` — This is used to help locate system packages, such as `libssl` headers/libraries. This may not be required in all cases, such as using vendored OpenSSL, or on Windows.
* OpenSSL — Only needed on Unix-like systems and only if the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature is not used.

  This requires the development headers, which can be obtained from the `libssl-dev` package on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` with apk or yum or the `openssl` package from Homebrew on macOS.

  If using the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature, then a static copy of OpenSSL will be built from source instead of using the system OpenSSL.
  This may require additional tools such as `perl` and `make`.

  On macOS, common installation directories from Homebrew, MacPorts, or pkgsrc will be checked. Otherwise it will fall back to `pkg-config`.

  On Windows, the system-provided Schannel will be used instead.

  LibreSSL is also supported.

**Optional system libraries:**

The build will automatically use vendored versions of the following libraries. However, if they are provided by the system and can be found with `pkg-config`, then the system libraries will be used instead:

* [`libcurl`](https://curl.se/libcurl/) — Used for network transfers.
* [`libgit2`](https://libgit2.org/) — Used for fetching git dependencies.
* [`libssh2`](https://www.libssh2.org/) — Used for SSH access to git repositories.
* [`libz`](https://zlib.net/) (AKA zlib) — Used by the above C libraries for data compression. (Rust code uses [`zlib-rs`](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/zlib-rs) instead.)

It is recommended to use the vendored versions as they are the versions that are tested to work with Cargo.

### Compiling

First, you&#039;ll want to check out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo.git
cd cargo
```

With `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.

[third-party-subcommands]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-cargo-subcommands


## Releases

Cargo releases coincide with Rust releases.
High level release notes are available as part of [Rust&#039;s release notes][rel].
Detailed release notes are available in the [changelog].

## About

**Yew** is a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded, front-end web apps with WebAssembly.

* Features a macro for declaring interactive HTML with Rust expressions. Developers who have experience using JSX in React should feel quite at home when using Yew.
* Achieves high performance by minimizing DOM API calls for each page render and by making it easy to offload processing to background web workers.
* Supports JavaScript interoperability, allowing developers to leverage NPM packages and integrate with existing JavaScript applications.

*Note: Yew is not 1.0 yet. Be prepared to do major refactoring due to breaking API changes.*

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Rust Programming Language

![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source of &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot; book.

[The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch].

[nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition

You can also read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with
the latest [stable], [beta], or [nightly] Rust releases. Be aware that issues
in those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those
releases are updated less frequently.

[stable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
[beta]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/
[nightly]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/

See the [releases] to download just the code of all the code listings that appear in the book.

[releases]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/releases

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same version that
rust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook
[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook --locked --version &lt;version_num&gt;
```

The book also uses two mdbook plugins which are part of this repository. If you
do not install them, you will see warnings when building and the output will not
look right, but you _will_ still be able to build the book. To use the plugins,
you should run:

```bash
$ cargo install --locked --path packages/mdbook-trpl --force
```

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in
your web browser.

_Firefox:_

```bash
$ firefox book/index.html                       # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Firefox&quot; book/index.html             # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;firefox.exe&quot; .\book\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start firefox.exe .\book\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
```

_Chrome:_

```bash
$ google-chrome book/index.html                 # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Google Chrome&quot; book/index.html       # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;chrome.exe&quot; .\book\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start chrome.exe .\book\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ cd packages/trpl
$ mdbook test --library-path packages/trpl/target/debug/deps
```

## Contributing

We&#039;d love your help! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] to learn about the
kinds of contributions we&#039;re looking for.

[contrib]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

Because the book is [printed][nostarch], and because we want
to keep the online version of the book close to the print version when
possible, it may take longer than you&#039;re used to for us to address your issue
or pull request.

So far, we&#039;ve been doing a larger revision to coincide with [Rust Editions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/). Between those larger
revisions, we will only be correcting errors. If your issue or pull request
isn&#039;t strictly fixing an error, it might sit until the next time that we&#039;re
working on a large revision: expect on the order of months or years. Thank you
for your patience!

### Translations

We&#039;d love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on
a new language! We&#039;re waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages
before we merge any in, but feel free to start!

[Translations]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATranslations
[mdbook support]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/5

## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
script available in the `ci` directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words,
which is provided in `ci/dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false
positive (say, you used the word `BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid),
you need to add this word to `ci/dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for
consistency).

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, Virtual Filesystem, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

&lt;/p&gt;

## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty&#039;s performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn&#039;t feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it&#039;s just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won&#039;t find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

## Project status

Ruffle supports ActionScript 1, 2 and 3 pretty well, but it&#039;s still not finished by any means. Please report any issues in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues).

## Using Ruffle

The easiest way to try out Ruffle is to visit the [web demo page](https://ruffle.rs/demo/), then click the &quot;Select File&quot; button to load a SWF file of your choice.

[Nightly builds](https://ruffle.rs/downloads#nightly-releases) of Ruffle are available for desktop and web platforms.

For more detailed instructions, see our [wiki page](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Using-Ruffle).

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

* Latest stable channel of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Java, available on your PATH as `java` (required for building the library containing the builtin Flash classes for ActionScript 3)

### Linux prerequisites

The following are typical dependencies for Linux:

* libasound2-dev
* libudev-dev
* default-jre-headless
* g++

### Desktop

#### Build

Use the following command to build and run the desktop app:

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_desktop`

To run a specific SWF file, pass the SWF path as an argument:

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_desktop -- test.swf`

To build in debug mode, simply omit `--release` from the command.

#### macOS

Ruffle desktop can be built from our [Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/homebrew-ruffle/):

`brew install --HEAD ruffle-rs/ruffle/ruffle`

_Note: because it is HEAD-only, you&#039;ll need to run `brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD ruffle` each time you want to update._

### Web or Extension

Follow [the instructions in the web directory](web/README.md#building-from-source) for building
either the web or browser extension version of Ruffle.

This project is tested with BrowserStack.

### Android

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle-android/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source) in the `ruffle-android` project for building the Android application of Ruffle.

### Scanner

If you have a collection of &quot;real world&quot; SWFs to test against, the scanner may be used to benchmark
ruffle&#039;s parsing capabilities. Provided with a folder and an output filename, it will attempt to read
all of the Flash files and report on the success of such a task.

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_scanner -- scan folder/with/swfs/ results.csv`

### Exporter

If you have a SWF file and would like to capture an image of it, you may use the exporter tool.
This currently requires hardware acceleration, but can be run headless (with no window).

- `cargo run --release --package=exporter -- path/to/file.swf`
- `cargo run --release --package=exporter -- path/to/file.swf path/to/screenshots --frames 5`

## Structure

- `core` - core emulator and common code
- `swf` - SWF and ActionScript parser
- `desktop` - desktop client (uses `wgpu-rs`)
- `web` - web client and browser extension (uses `wasm-bindgen`)
- `render` - various rendering backends for both desktop and web
- `video` - video decoding backends
- `flv` - Flash Video decoder
- `wstr` - a Flash-compatible implementation of strings
- `scanner` - a utility to bulk parse SWF files
- `exporter` - a utility to generate PNG screenshots of a SWF file

## Sponsors

You can support the development of Ruffle via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ruffle-rs). Your sponsorship will help to ensure the accessibility of Flash content for the future. Thank you!

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

## About

* **[Features](https://bevy.org):** A quick overview of Bevy&#039;s features.

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevy.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevy.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate.

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

[pace]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-7.7
[`SO_TXTIME`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-etf.8.html

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

[examples/]: quiche/examples/

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.82 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[Android NDK]: https://developer.android.com/ndk
[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
- [cloudflare/quiche-qns](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche-qns)

The `latest` tag will be updated whenever quiche master branch updates.

**cloudflare/quiche**

Provides a server and client installed in /usr/local/bin.

**cloudflare/quiche-qns**

Provides the script to test quiche within the [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).

LLRT (**L**ow **L**atency **R**un**t**ime) is a lightweight JavaScript runtime designed to address the growing demand for fast and efficient Serverless applications. LLRT offers up to over **10x** faster startup and up to **2x** overall lower cost compared to other JavaScript runtimes running on **AWS Lambda**

It&#039;s built in Rust, utilizing QuickJS as JavaScript engine, ensuring efficient memory usage and swift startup.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; LLRT is an **experimental** package. It is subject to change and intended only for evaluation purposes.

## Configure Lambda functions to use LLRT

Download the last LLRT release from &lt;https://github.com/awslabs/llrt/releases&gt;

### Option 1: Custom runtime (recommended)

Choose `Custom Runtime on Amazon Linux 2023` and package the LLRT `bootstrap` binary together with your JS code.

### Option 2: Use a layer

Choose `Custom Runtime on Amazon Linux 2023`, upload `llrt-lambda-arm64.zip` or `llrt-lambda-x64.zip` as a layer and add to your function

### Option 3: Package LLRT in a container image

See our [AWS SAM example](./example/llrt-sam-container-image) or:

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=arm64 busybox
WORKDIR /var/task/
COPY app.mjs ./
ADD https://github.com/awslabs/llrt/releases/latest/download/llrt-container-arm64 /usr/bin/llrt
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/llrt

ENV LAMBDA_HANDLER &quot;app.handler&quot;

CMD [ &quot;llrt&quot; ]
```

### Option 4: AWS SAM

The following [example project](example/llrt-sam/) sets up a lambda
instrumented with a layer containing the llrt runtime.

### Option 5: AWS CDK

You can use [`cdk-lambda-llrt` construct library](https://github.com/tmokmss/cdk-lambda-llrt) to deploy LLRT Lambda functions with AWS CDK.

```ts
import { LlrtFunction } from &quot;cdk-lambda-llrt&quot;;

const handler = new LlrtFunction(this, &quot;Handler&quot;, {
  entry: &quot;lambda/index.ts&quot;,
});
```

See [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/packages/cdk-lambda-llrt/) and [its examples](https://github.com/tmokmss/cdk-lambda-llrt/tree/main/example) for more details.

That&#039;s it 🎉

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Even though LLRT supports [ES2023](https://262.ecma-international.org/14.0/) it&#039;s **NOT** a drop in replacement for Node.js. Consult [Compatibility matrix](#compatibility-matrix) and [API](API.md) for more details.
&gt; All dependencies should be bundled for a `browser` platform and mark included `@aws-sdk` packages as external.

## Testing &amp; ensuring compatibility

The best way to ensure your code is compatible with LLRT is to write tests and execute them using the built-in test runner. The test runner currently supports Jest/Chai assertions. There are three main types of tests you can create:

Unit Tests

- Useful for validating specific modules and functions in isolation
- Allow focused testing of individual components

End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- Validate overall compatibility with AWS SDK and WinterCG compliance
- Test the integration between all components
- Confirm expected behavior from end-user perspective
- For more information about the E2E Tests and how to run them, see [here](tests/e2e/README.md).

Web Platform Tests (WPT)

- Useful for validating LLRT’s behavior against standardized browser APIs and runtime expectations
- Ensure compatibility with web standards and cross-runtime environments
- Help verify alignment with WinterCG and broader JavaScript ecosystem
- For setup instructions and how to run WPT in LLRT, see [here](tests/wpt/README.md).

### Test runner

Test runner uses a lightweight Jest-like API and supports Jest/Chai assertions. For examples on how to implement tests for LLRT see the `/tests` folder of this repository.

To run tests, execute the `llrt test` command. LLRT scans the current directory and sub-directories for files that ends with `*.test.js` or `*.test.mjs`. You can also provide a specific test directory to scan by using the `llrt test -d &lt;directory&gt;` option.

The test runner also has support for filters. Using filters is as simple as adding additional command line arguments, i.e: `llrt test crypto` will only run tests that match the filename containing `crypto`.

## Compatibility matrix

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; LLRT only support a fraction of the Node.js APIs. It is **NOT** a drop in replacement for Node.js, nor will it ever be. Below is a high level overview of partially supported APIs and modules. For more details consult the [API](API.md) documentation

## Using node_modules (dependencies) with LLRT

Since LLRT is meant for performance critical application it&#039;s not recommended to deploy `node_modules` without bundling, minification and tree-shaking.

LLRT can work with any bundler of your choice. Below are some configurations for popular bundlers:

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; LLRT implements native modules that are largely compatible with the following external packages.
&gt; By implementing the following conversions in the bundler&#039;s alias function, your application may be faster, but we recommend that you test thoroughly as they are not fully compatible.

| Node.js         | LLRT      |
| --------------- | --------- |
| fast-xml-parser | llrt:xml  |
| uuid            | llrt:uuid |

## Using AWS SDK (v3) with LLRT

LLRT includes many AWS SDK clients and utils as part of the runtime, built into the executable. These SDK Clients have been specifically fine-tuned to offer best performance while not compromising on compatibility. LLRT replaces some JavaScript dependencies used by the AWS SDK by native ones such as Hash calculations and XML parsing.
V3 SDK packages not included in the list below have to be bundled with your source code. For an example on how to use a non-included SDK, see [this example build script (buildExternalSdkFunction)](example/functions/build.mjs)

LLRT supports the following three bundles by default. Bundle types and suffixes are as follows.

| Bundle Type | Suffix      | Purpose of Use                                            |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| no-sdk      | \*-no-sdk   | Suitable for workloads that do not use `@aws-sdk`.        |
| std-sdk     | (none)      | Suitable for workloads that utilize the major `@aws-sdk`. |
| full-sdk    | \*-full-sdk | Suitable for workloads that utilize any `@aws-sdk`.       |

The relationship between the supported packages for each bundle type is as follows.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; LLRT currently does not support returning streams from SDK responses. Use `response.Body.transformToString();` or `response.Body.transformToByteArray();` as shown below.
&gt;
&gt; ```javascript
&gt; const response = await client.send(command);
&gt; // or &#039;transformToByteArray()&#039;
&gt; const str = await response.Body.transformToString();
&gt; ```

## Running TypeScript with LLRT

Same principle as dependencies applies when using TypeScript. TypeScript must be bundled and transpiled into ES2023 JavaScript.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; LLRT will not support running TypeScript without transpilation. This is by design for performance reasons. Transpiling requires CPU and memory that adds latency and cost during execution. This can be avoided if done ahead of time during deployment.

## Rationale

What justifies the introduction of another JavaScript runtime in light of existing options such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Bun](https://bun.sh) &amp; [Deno](https://deno.com/)?

Node.js, Bun, and Deno represent highly proficient JavaScript runtimes. However, they are designed with general-purpose applications in mind. These runtimes were not specifically tailored for the demands of a Serverless environment, characterized by short-lived runtime instances. They each depend on a ([Just-In-Time compiler (JIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) for dynamic code compilation and optimization during execution. While JIT compilation offers substantial long-term performance advantages, it carries a computational and memory overhead.

In contrast, LLRT distinguishes itself by not incorporating a JIT compiler, a strategic decision that yields two significant advantages:

A) JIT compilation is a notably sophisticated technological component, introducing increased system complexity and contributing substantially to the runtime&#039;s overall size.

B) Without the JIT overhead, LLRT conserves both CPU and memory resources that can be more efficiently allocated to code execution tasks, thereby reducing application startup times.

## Limitations

There are many cases where LLRT shows notable performance drawbacks compared with JIT-powered runtimes, such as large data processing, Monte Carlo simulations or performing tasks with hundreds of thousands or millions of iterations. LLRT is most effective when applied to smaller Serverless functions dedicated to tasks such as data transformation, real time processing, AWS service integrations, authorization, validation etc. It is designed to complement existing components rather than serve as a comprehensive replacement for everything. Notably, given its supported APIs are based on Node.js specification, transitioning back to alternative solutions requires minimal code adjustments.

## Building from source

1. Clone code and cd to directory

```
git clone git@github.com:awslabs/llrt.git
cd llrt
```

2. Install git submodules

```
git submodule update --init --checkout
```

3. Install rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | bash -s -- -y
source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;
```

4. Install dependencies

```
# MacOS
brew install zig make cmake zstd node corepack

# Ubuntu
sudo apt -y install make zstd
sudo snap install zig --classic --beta

# Windows WSL2 (requires systemd to be enabled*)
sudo apt -y install cmake g++ gcc make zip zstd
sudo snap install zig --classic --beta

# Windows WSL2 (If Node.js is not yet installed)
sudo
