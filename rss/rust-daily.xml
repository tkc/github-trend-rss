## Quickstart

Run Forge in interactive mode via npx

```bash
npx forgecode@latest
```

Connect through the Forge app and complete the OAuth process.
This will open your browser to app.forgecode.dev where you can sign up or sign in with Google/GitHub.

That&#039;s it! Forge is now ready to assist you with your development tasks.

## Usage Examples

Forge can be used in different ways depending on your needs. Here are some common usage patterns:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Understanding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; Can you explain how the authentication system works in this codebase?
```

Forge will analyze your project&#039;s structure, identify authentication-related files, and provide a detailed explanation of the authentication flow, including the relationships between different components.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing New Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I need to add a dark mode toggle to our React application. How should I approach this?
```

Forge will suggest the best approach based on your current codebase, explain the steps needed, and even scaffold the necessary components and styles for you.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I&#039;m getting this error: &quot;TypeError: Cannot read property &#039;map&#039; of undefined&quot;. What might be causing it?
```

Forge will analyze the error, suggest potential causes based on your code, and propose different solutions to fix the issue.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; Please review the code in src/components/UserProfile.js and suggest improvements
```

Forge will analyze the code, identify potential issues, and suggest improvements for readability, performance, security, and maintainability.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning New Technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I want to integrate GraphQL into this Express application. Can you explain how to get started?
```

Forge will provide a tailored tutorial on integrating GraphQL with Express, using your specific project structure as context.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database Schema Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I need to design a database schema for a blog with users, posts, comments, and categories
```

Forge will suggest an appropriate schema design, including tables/collections, relationships, indexes, and constraints based on your project&#039;s existing database technology.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring Legacy Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; Help me refactor this class-based component to use React Hooks
```

Forge can help modernize your codebase by walking you through refactoring steps and implementing them with your approval.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I need to merge branch &#039;feature/user-profile&#039; into main but there are conflicts
```

Forge can guide you through resolving git conflicts, explaining the differences and suggesting the best way to reconcile them.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Why Forge?

Forge is designed for developers who want to enhance their workflow with AI assistance while maintaining full control over their development environment.

- **Zero configuration** - Just add your API key and you&#039;re ready to go
- **Seamless integration** - Works right in your terminal, where you already work
- **Multi-provider support** - Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM providers
- **Secure by design** - Your code stays on your machine
- **Open-source** - Transparent, extensible, and community-driven

Forge helps you code faster, solve complex problems, and learn new technologies without leaving your terminal.

## Command-Line Options

Here&#039;s a quick reference of Forge&#039;s command-line options:

| Option                          | Description                                                |

## Advanced Configuration

### Provider Configuration

Forge supports multiple AI providers. Below are setup instructions for each supported provider:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;forgecode.dev (Recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
FORGE_KEY=ForgeKey
```

To use Forgecode&#039;s provider with Forge:

1. Visit [https://app.forgecode.dev/](https://app.forgecode.dev/)
2. Login with your existing credentials or create a new account
3. Once logged in, your account will automatically enable the Forge Provider

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenRouter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=&lt;your_openrouter_api_key&gt;
```

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requesty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
REQUESTY_API_KEY=&lt;your_requesty_api_key&gt;
```

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;x-ai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
XAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_xai_api_key&gt;
```

switch the model using `/model` command in the Forge CLI.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_openai_api_key&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: o3-mini-high
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&lt;your_anthropic_api_key&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: claude-3.7-sonnet
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Vertex AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
PROJECT_ID=&lt;your_project_id&gt;
LOCATION=&lt;your_location&gt;
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;vertex_ai_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/endpoints/openapi
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-7-sonnet
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI-Compatible Providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_provider_api_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=&lt;your_provider_url&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: &lt;provider-specific-model&gt;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groq&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_groq_api_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Bedrock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

To use Amazon Bedrock models with Forge, you&#039;ll need to first set up the [Bedrock Access Gateway](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway):

1. **Set up Bedrock Access Gateway**:

   - Follow the deployment steps in the [Bedrock Access Gateway repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway)
   - Create your own API key in Secrets Manager
   - Deploy the CloudFormation stack
   - Note your API Base URL from the CloudFormation outputs

2. **Create these files in your project directory**:

   ```bash
   # .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_bedrock_gateway_api_key&gt;
   OPENAI_URL=&lt;your_bedrock_gateway_base_url&gt;
   ```

   ```yaml
   # forge.yaml
   model: anthropic.claude-3-opus
   ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

### forge.yaml Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

Forge supports several environment variables for advanced configuration and fine-tuning. These can be set in your `.env` file or system environment.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retry Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Control how Forge handles retry logic for failed requests:

```bash
# .env
FORGE_RETRY_INITIAL_BACKOFF_MS=1000    # Initial backoff time in milliseconds (default: 1000)
FORGE_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR=2           # Multiplier for backoff time (default: 2)  
FORGE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3             # Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
FORGE_SUPPRESS_RETRY_ERRORS=false      # Suppress retry error messages (default: false)
FORGE_RETRY_STATUS_CODES=429,500,502   # HTTP status codes to retry (default: 429,500,502,503,504)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Fine-tune HTTP client behavior for API requests:

```bash
# .env
FORGE_HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30              # Connection timeout in seconds (default: 30)
FORGE_HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT=900                # Read timeout in seconds (default: 900)
FORGE_HTTP_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT=90            # Pool idle timeout in seconds (default: 90)
FORGE_HTTP_POOL_MAX_IDLE_PER_HOST=5        # Max idle connections per host (default: 5)
FORGE_HTTP_MAX_REDIRECTS=10                # Maximum redirects to follow (default: 10)
FORGE_HTTP_USE_HICKORY=false               # Use Hickory DNS resolver (default: false)
FORGE_HTTP_TLS_BACKEND=default             # TLS backend: &quot;default&quot; or &quot;rustls&quot; (default: &quot;default&quot;)
FORGE_HTTP_MIN_TLS_VERSION=1.2             # Minimum TLS version: &quot;1.0&quot;, &quot;1.1&quot;, &quot;1.2&quot;, &quot;1.3&quot;
FORGE_HTTP_MAX_TLS_VERSION=1.3             # Maximum TLS version: &quot;1.0&quot;, &quot;1.1&quot;, &quot;1.2&quot;, &quot;1.3&quot;
FORGE_HTTP_ADAPTIVE_WINDOW=true            # Enable HTTP/2 adaptive window (default: true)
FORGE_HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL=60          # Keep-alive interval in seconds (default: 60, use &quot;none&quot;/&quot;disabled&quot; to disable)
FORGE_HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT=10           # Keep-alive timeout in seconds (default: 10)
FORGE_HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE_WHILE_IDLE=true      # Keep-alive while idle (default: true)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Override default API endpoints:

```bash
# .env
FORGE_API_URL=https://api.forgecode.dev  # Custom Forge API URL (default: https://api.forgecode.dev)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

System-level environment variables (usually set automatically):

```bash
# .env
FORGE_MAX_SEARCH_RESULT_BYTES=101024   # Maximum bytes for search results (default: 101024 - 10 KB)
SHELL=/bin/zsh                         # Shell to use for command execution (Unix/Linux/macOS)
COMSPEC=cmd.exe                        # Command processor to use (Windows)
```

&lt;/details&gt;


The `forge.yaml` file supports several advanced configuration options that let you customize Forge&#039;s behavior.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Add your own guidelines that all agents should follow when generating responses.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
custom_rules: |
  1. Always add comprehensive error handling to any code you write.
  2. Include unit tests for all new functions.
  3. Follow our team&#039;s naming convention: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes.
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Define custom commands as shortcuts for repetitive prompts:

```yaml
# forge.yaml
commands:
  - name: &#039;refactor&#039;
    description: &#039;Refactor selected code&#039;
    prompt: &#039;Please refactor this code to improve readability and performance&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Specify the default AI model to use for all agents in the workflow.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: &#039;claude-3.7-sonnet&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Walker Depth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Control how deeply Forge traverses your project directory structure when gathering context.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
max_walker_depth: 3 # Limit directory traversal to 3 levels deep
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Adjust the creativity and randomness in AI responses. Lower values (0.0-0.3) produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (0.7-2.0) generate more diverse and creative results.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
temperature: 0.7 # Balanced creativity and focus
```

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool Max Failure Limit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Control how many times a tool can fail before Forge forces completion to prevent infinite retry loops. This helps avoid situations where an agent gets stuck repeatedly trying the same failing operation.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
max_tool_failure_per_turn: 3 # Allow up to 3 failures per tool before forcing completion
```

Set to a higher value if you want more retry attempts, or lower if you want faster failure detection.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Requests Per Turn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Limit the maximum number of requests an agent can make in a single conversation turn. This prevents runaway conversations and helps control API usage and costs.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
max_requests_per_turn: 50 # Allow up to 50 requests per turn
```

When this limit is reached, Forge will:
- Ask you if you wish to continue
- If you respond with &#039;Yes&#039;, it will continue the conversation
- If you respond with &#039;No&#039;, it will end the conversation

&lt;/details&gt;

---

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The MCP feature allows AI agents to communicate with external tools and services. This implementation follows Anthropic&#039;s [Model Context Protocol](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp) design.

### MCP Configuration

Configure MCP servers using the CLI:

```bash
# List all MCP servers
forge mcp list

# Add a new server
forge mcp add

# Add a server using JSON format
forge mcp add-json

# Get server details
forge mcp get

# Remove a server
forge mcp remove
```

Or manually create a `.mcp.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
	&quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
		&quot;server_name&quot;: {
			&quot;command&quot;: &quot;command_to_execute&quot;,
			&quot;args&quot;: [&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;],
			&quot;env&quot;: { &quot;ENV_VAR&quot;: &quot;value&quot; }
		},
		&quot;another_server&quot;: {
			&quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000/events&quot;
		}
	}
}
```

MCP configurations are read from two locations (in order of precedence):

1. Local configuration (project-specific)
2. User configuration (user-specific)

### Example Use Cases

MCP can be used for various integrations:

- Web browser automation
- External API interactions
- Tool integration
- Custom service connections

### Usage in Multi-Agent Workflows

MCP tools can be used as part of multi-agent workflows, allowing specialized agents to interact with external systems as part of a collaborative problem-solving approach.

&lt;/details&gt;

A secure, stable and high-performance reverse proxy for NAT traversal, written in Rust

rathole, like [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) and [ngrok](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok), can help to expose the service on the device behind the NAT to the Internet, via a server with a public IP.

## Features

- **High Performance** Much higher throughput can be achieved than frp, and more stable when handling a large volume of connections. See [Benchmark](#benchmark)
- **Low Resource Consumption** Consumes much fewer memory than similar tools. See [Benchmark](#benchmark). [The binary can be](docs/build-guide.md) **as small as ~500KiB** to fit the constraints of devices, like embedded devices as routers.
- **Security** Tokens of services are mandatory and service-wise. The server and clients are responsible for their own configs. With the optional Noise Protocol, encryption can be configured at ease. No need to create a self-signed certificate! TLS is also supported.
- **Hot Reload** Services can be added or removed dynamically by hot-reloading the configuration file. HTTP API is WIP.

## Quickstart

A full-powered `rathole` can be obtained from the [release](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/releases) page. Or [build from source](docs/build-guide.md) **for other platforms and minimizing the binary**. A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapiz1/rathole) is also available.

The usage of `rathole` is very similar to frp. If you have experience with the latter, then the configuration is very easy for you. The only difference is that configuration of a service is split into the client side and the server side, and a token is mandatory.

To use `rathole`, you need a server with a public IP, and a device behind the NAT, where some services that need to be exposed to the Internet.

Assuming you have a NAS at home behind the NAT, and want to expose its ssh service to the Internet:

1. On the server which has a public IP

Create `server.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# server.toml
[server]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:2333&quot; # `2333` specifies the port that rathole listens for clients

[server.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Token that is used to authenticate the client for the service. Change to an arbitrary value.
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:5202&quot; # `5202` specifies the port that exposes `my_nas_ssh` to the Internet
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole server.toml
```

2. On the host which is behind the NAT (your NAS)

Create `client.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# client.toml
[client]
remote_addr = &quot;myserver.com:2333&quot; # The address of the server. The port must be the same with the port in `server.bind_addr`

[client.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Must be the same with the server to pass the validation
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:22&quot; # The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole client.toml
```

3. Now the client will try to connect to the server `myserver.com` on port `2333`, and any traffic to `myserver.com:5202` will be forwarded to the client&#039;s port `22`.

So you can `ssh myserver.com:5202` to ssh to your NAS.

To run `rathole` run as a background service on Linux, checkout the [systemd examples](./examples/systemd).

## Configuration

`rathole` can automatically determine to run in the server mode or the client mode, according to the content of the configuration file, if only one of `[server]` and `[client]` block is present, like the example in [Quickstart](#quickstart).

But the `[client]` and `[server]` block can also be put in one file. Then on the server side, run `rathole --server config.toml` and on the client side, run `rathole --client config.toml` to explicitly tell `rathole` the running mode.

Before heading to the full configuration specification, it&#039;s recommend to skim [the configuration examples](./examples) to get a feeling of the configuration format.

See [Transport](./docs/transport.md) for more details about encryption and the `transport` block.

Here is the full configuration specification:

nodelay = true # Optional. Same as the client

[server.services.service2]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.1:8082&quot;
```

### Logging

`rathole`, like many other Rust programs, use environment variables to control the logging level. `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, `trace` are available.

```shell
RUST_LOG=error ./rathole config.toml
```

will run `rathole` with only error level logging.

If `RUST_LOG` is not present, the default logging level is `info`.

### Tuning

From v0.4.7, rathole enables TCP_NODELAY by default, which should benefit the latency and interactive applications like rdp, Minecraft servers. However, it slightly decreases the bandwidth.

If the bandwidth is more important, TCP_NODELAY can be opted out with `nodelay = false`.

## Benchmark

rathole has similar latency to [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), but can handle a more connections, provide larger bandwidth, with less memory usage.

For more details, see the separate page [Benchmark](./docs/benchmark.md).

**However, don&#039;t take it from here that `rathole` can magically make your forwarded service faster several times than before.** The benchmark is done on local loopback, indicating the performance when the task is cpu-bounded. One can gain quite a improvement if the network is not the bottleneck. Unfortunately, that&#039;s not true for many users. In that case, the main benefit is lower resource consumption, while the bandwidth and the latency may not improved significantly.

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ˈdiːnoʊ/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

[Ratatui][Ratatui Website] (_ˌræ.təˈtu.i_) is a Rust crate for cooking up terminal user interfaces
(TUIs). It provides a simple and flexible way to create text-based user interfaces in the terminal,
which can be used for command-line applications, dashboards, and other interactive console programs.

## Quickstart

Ratatui has [templates] available to help you get started quickly. You can use the
[`cargo-generate`] command to create a new project with Ratatui:

```shell
cargo install --locked cargo-generate
cargo generate ratatui/templates
```

Selecting the Hello World template produces the following application:

```rust
use color_eyre::Result;
use crossterm::event::{self, Event};
use ratatui::{DefaultTerminal, Frame};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    color_eyre::install()?;
    let terminal = ratatui::init();
    let result = run(terminal);
    ratatui::restore();
    result
}

fn run(mut terminal: DefaultTerminal) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    loop {
        terminal.draw(render)?;
        if matches!(event::read()?, Event::Key(_)) {
            break Ok(());
        }
    }
}

fn render(frame: &amp;mut Frame) {
    frame.render_widget(&quot;hello world&quot;, frame.area());
}
```

Ratatui was forked from the [tui-rs] crate in 2023 in order to continue its development. None of
this could be possible without [Florian Dehau] who originally created [tui-rs] which inspired many
Rust TUIs.

Special thanks to [Pavel Fomchenkov] for his work in designing an awesome logo for the Ratatui
project and organization.

## BAML: Basically a Made-up Language
&lt;h4&gt;

[Homepage](https://www.boundaryml.com/) | [Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com) | [BAML AI Chat](https://www.boundaryml.com/chat) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/BTNBeXGuaS)



&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

BAML is a simple prompting language for building reliable **AI workflows and agents**.

BAML makes prompt engineering easy by turning it into _schema engineering_ -- where you mostly focus on the models of your prompt -- to get more reliable outputs. 
You don&#039;t need to write your whole app in BAML, only the prompts! You can wire-up your LLM Functions in any language of your choice! See our quickstarts for [Python](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/python), [TypeScript](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/typescript), [Ruby](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/ruby) and [Go, and more](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/rest-api-other-languages).

BAML comes with all batteries included -- with full typesafety, streaming, retries, wide model support, even when they don&#039;t support native [tool-calling APIs](#enable-reliable-tool-calling-with-any-model-even-when-they-dont-support-it)

**Try BAML**: [Prompt Fiddle](https://www.promptfiddle.com) • [Interactive App Examples](https://baml-examples.vercel.app/)


## The core BAML principle: LLM Prompts are functions

The fundamental building block in BAML is a function. Every prompt is a function that takes in parameters and returns a type.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; string
```

Every function additionally defines which models it uses and what its prompt is.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; StopTool | ReplyTool {
    client &quot;openai/gpt-4o-mini&quot;

    prompt #&quot;
        Be a {{ tone }} bot.

        {{ ctx.output_format }}

        {% for m in message %}
        {{ _.role(m.role) }}
        {{ m.content }}
        {% endfor %}
    &quot;#
}

class Message {
    role string
    content string
}

class ReplyTool {
  response string
}

class StopTool {
  action &quot;stop&quot; @description(#&quot;
    when it might be a good time to end the conversation
  &quot;#)
}
```

## BAML Functions can be called from any language
Below we call the ChatAgent function we defined in BAML through Python. BAML&#039;s Rust compiler generates a &quot;baml_client&quot; to access and call them.

```python
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import Message, StopTool

messages = [Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=&quot;How can I help?&quot;)]

while True:
  print(messages[-1].content)
  user_reply = input()
  messages.append(Message(role=&quot;user&quot;, content=user_reply))
  tool = b.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
  if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
    print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
    break
  else:
    messages.append(Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=tool.response))
```
You can write any kind of agent or workflow using chained BAML functions. An agent is a while loop that calls a Chat BAML Function with some state.

And if you need to stream, add a couple more lines:
```python
stream = b.stream.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
# partial is a Partial type with all Optional fields
for tool in stream:
    if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
      ...
    
final = stream.get_final_response()
```
And get fully type-safe outputs for each chunk in the stream.

## Test prompts 10x faster, right in your IDE
BAML comes with native tooling for VSCode (jetbrains + neovim coming soon). 

**Visualize full prompt (including any multi-modal assets), and the API request**. BAML gives you full transparency and control of the prompt.

![raw-curl](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b34db9-80cd-45a7-a356-6b5ab4a9c5b7)

**Using AI is all about iteration speed.**

If testing your pipeline takes 2 minutes, you can only test 10 ideas in 20 minutes.

If you reduce it to 5 seconds, you can test 240 ideas in the same amount of time.
![resume-attempt2-smaller2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc6b8a6-ffed-4cfc-80b8-78bc8a3d66a6)

The playground also allows you to run tests in parallel -- for even faster iteration speeds 🚀.

No need to login to websites, and no need to manually define json schemas.

## Enable reliable tool-calling with any model
BAML works even when the models don&#039;t support native tool-calling APIs. We created the SAP (schema-aligned parsing) algorithm to support the flexible outputs LLMs can provide, like markdown within a JSON blob or chain-of-thought prior to answering. [Read more about SAP](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsing)

With BAML, your structured outputs work in Day-1 of a model release. No need to figure out whether a model supports parallel tool calls, or whether it supports recursive schemas, or `anyOf` or `oneOf` etc.

See it in action with: **[Deepseek-R1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/deepseek-r1-function-calling)** and [OpenAI O1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/openai-o1).

## Build beautiful streaming UIs
BAML generates a ton of utilities for NextJS, Python (and any language) to make streaming UIs easy.
![recipe-generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf82495b-21fc-40bf-ae98-93eef923d620)

BAML&#039;s streaming interfaces are fully type-safe. Check out the [Streaming Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/baml-basics/streaming), and our [React hooks](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/framework-integration/react-next-js/quick-start)

## Fully Open-Source, and offline
- 100% open-source (Apache 2)
- 100% private. AGI will not require an internet connection, neither will BAML
    - No network requests beyond model calls you explicitly set
    - Not stored or used for any training data
- BAML files can be saved locally on your machine and checked into Github for easy diffs.
- Built in Rust. So fast, you can&#039;t even tell it&#039;s there.

## BAML&#039;s Design Philosophy

Everything is fair game when making new syntax. If you can code it, it can be yours. This is our design philosophy to help restrict ideas:

- **1:** Avoid invention when possible
    - Yes, prompts need versioning — we have a great versioning tool: git
    - Yes, you need to save prompts — we have a great storage tool: filesystems
- **2:** Any file editor and any terminal should be enough to use it
- **3:** Be fast
- **4:** A first year university student should be able to understand it

## Why a new programming language

We used to write websites like this:

```python
def home():
    return &quot;&lt;button onclick=\&quot;() =&gt; alert(\\\&quot;hello!\\\&quot;)\&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;&quot;
```

And now we do this:

```jsx
function Home() {
  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prev =&gt; prev + 1)}&gt;
          {count} clicks!
         &lt;/button&gt;
}
```

New syntax can be incredible at expressing new ideas. Plus the idea of maintaining hundreds of f-strings for prompts kind of disgusts us 🤮. Strings are bad for maintainable codebases. We prefer structured strings.

The goal of BAML is to give you the expressiveness of English, but the structure of code.

## Conclusion

As models get better, we&#039;ll continue expecting even more out of them. But what will never change is that we&#039;ll want a way to write maintainable code that uses those models. The current way we all just assemble strings is very reminiscent of the early days PHP/HTML soup in web development. We hope some of the ideas we shared today can make a tiny dent in helping us all shape the way we all code tomorrow.

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we used Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we’ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:

-   We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    -   Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    -   Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
-   We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3rd 2024 the last beta release.
-   We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4th 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
-   We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28th 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
-   We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) in June 20th 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth documentation](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

-   Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
-   See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.88.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/06/26/Rust-1.88.0/).

See the docs for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [docs][book].

If the answer is not there:

-   Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or
-   Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or
-   Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-bug%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug.yml)

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

-   [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
-   [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
-   [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80) . Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex  # Alternatively: `brew install codex`
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. You&#039;ll need a Plus, Pro, or Team ChatGPT account, and will get access to our latest models, including `gpt-5`, at no extra cost to your plan. (Enterprise is coming soon.)

&gt; Important: If you&#039;ve used the Codex CLI before, follow these steps to migrate from usage-based billing with your API key:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Update the CLI and ensure `codex --version` is `0.20.0` or later
&gt; 2. Delete `~/.codex/auth.json` (this should be `C:\Users\USERNAME\.codex\auth.json` on Windows)
&gt; 3. Run `codex login` again

If you encounter problems with the login flow, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Connecting on a &quot;Headless&quot; Machine

Today, the login process entails running a server on `localhost:1455`. If you are on a &quot;headless&quot; server, such as a Docker container or are `ssh`&#039;d into a remote machine, loading `localhost:1455` in the browser on your local machine will not automatically connect to the webserver running on the _headless_ machine, so you must use one of the following workarounds:

#### Authenticate locally and copy your credentials to the &quot;headless&quot; machine

The easiest solution is likely to run through the `codex login` process on your local machine such that `localhost:1455` _is_ accessible in your web browser. When you complete the authentication process, an `auth.json` file should be available at `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` (on Mac/Linux, `$CODEX_HOME` defaults to `~/.codex` whereas on Windows, it defaults to `%USERPROFILE%\.codex`).

Because the `auth.json` file is not tied to a specific host, once you complete the authentication flow locally, you can copy the `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` file to the headless machine and then `codex` should &quot;just work&quot; on that machine. Note to copy a file to a Docker container, you can do:

```shell
# substitute MY_CONTAINER with the name or id of your Docker container:
CONTAINER_HOME=$(docker exec MY_CONTAINER printenv HOME)
docker exec MY_CONTAINER mkdir -p &quot;$CONTAINER_HOME/.codex&quot;
docker cp auth.json MY_CONTAINER:&quot;$CONTAINER_HOME/.codex/auth.json&quot;
```

whereas if you are `ssh`&#039;d into a remote machine, you likely want to use [`scp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol):

```shell
ssh user@remote &#039;mkdir -p ~/.codex&#039;
scp ~/.codex/auth.json user@remote:~/.codex/auth.json
```

or try this one-liner:

```shell
ssh user@remote &#039;mkdir -p ~/.codex &amp;&amp; cat &gt; ~/.codex/auth.json&#039; &lt; ~/.codex/auth.json
```

#### Connecting through VPS or remote

If you run Codex on a remote machine (VPS/server) without a local browser, the login helper starts a server on `localhost:1455` on the remote host. To complete login in your local browser, forward that port to your machine before starting the login flow:

```bash
# From your local machine
ssh -L 1455:localhost:1455 &lt;user&gt;@&lt;remote-host&gt;
```

Then, in that SSH session, run `codex` and select &quot;Sign in with ChatGPT&quot;. When prompted, open the printed URL (it will be `http://localhost:1455/...`) in your local browser. The traffic will be tunneled to the remote server.

### Usage-based billing alternative: Use an OpenAI API key

If you prefer to pay-as-you-go, you can still authenticate with your OpenAI API key by setting it as an environment variable:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
```

Notes:

- This command only sets the key for your current terminal session, which we recommend. To set it for all future sessions, you can also add the `export` line to your shell&#039;s configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`).
- If you have signed in with ChatGPT, Codex will default to using your ChatGPT credits. If you wish to use your API key, use the `/logout` command to clear your ChatGPT authentication.

### Choosing Codex&#039;s level of autonomy

We always recommend running Codex in its default sandbox that gives you strong guardrails around what the agent can do. The default sandbox prevents it from editing files outside its workspace, or from accessing the network.

When you launch Codex in a new folder, it detects whether the folder is version controlled and recommends one of two levels of autonomy:

#### **1. Read/write**

- Codex can run commands and write files in the workspace without approval.
- To write files in other folders, access network, update git or perform other actions protected by the sandbox, Codex will need your permission.
- By default, the workspace includes the current directory, as well as temporary directories like `/tmp`. You can see what directories are in the workspace with the `/status` command. See the docs for how to customize this behavior.
- Advanced: You can manually specify this configuration by running `codex --sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval on-request`
- This is the recommended default for version-controlled folders.

#### **2. Read-only**

- Codex can run read-only commands without approval.
- To edit files, access network, or perform other actions protected by the sandbox, Codex will need your permission.
- Advanced: You can manually specify this configuration by running `codex --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request`
- This is the recommended default non-version-controlled folders.

#### **3. Advanced configuration**

Codex gives you fine-grained control over the sandbox with the `--sandbox` option, and over when it requests approval with the `--ask-for-approval` option. Run `codex help` for more on these options.

#### Can I run without ANY approvals?

Yes, run codex non-interactively with `--ask-for-approval never`. This option works with all `--sandbox` options, so you still have full control over Codex&#039;s level of autonomy. It will make its best attempt with whatever contrainsts you provide. For example:

- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox read-only` when you are running many agents to answer questions in parallel in the same workspace.
- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox workspace-write` when you want the agent to non-interactively take time to produce the best outcome, with strong guardrails around its behavior.
- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox danger-full-access` to dangerously give the agent full autonomy. Because this disables important safety mechanisms, we recommend against using this unless running Codex in an isolated environment.

#### Fine-tuning in `config.toml`

```toml
# approval mode
approval_policy = &quot;untrusted&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;read-only&quot;

# full-auto mode
approval_policy = &quot;on-request&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;workspace-write&quot;

# Optional: allow network in workspace-write mode
[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

You can also save presets as **profiles**:

```toml
[profiles.full_auto]
approval_policy = &quot;on-request&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;workspace-write&quot;

[profiles.readonly_quiet]
approval_policy = &quot;never&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;read-only&quot;
```

### Example prompts

Below are a few bite-size examples you can copy-paste. Replace the text in quotes with your own task. See the [prompting guide](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-cli/examples/prompting_guide.md) for more tips and usage patterns.

| ✨  | What you type                                                                   | What happens                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `codex &quot;Refactor the Dashboard component to React Hooks&quot;`                       | Codex rewrites the class component, runs `npm test`, and shows the diff.   |
| 2   | `codex &quot;Generate SQL migrations for adding a users table&quot;`                      | Infers your ORM, creates migration files, and runs them in a sandboxed DB. |
| 3   | `codex &quot;Write unit tests for utils/date.ts&quot;`                                    | Generates tests, executes them, and iterates until they pass.              |
| 4   | `codex &quot;Bulk-rename *.jpeg -&gt; *.jpg with git mv&quot;`                               | Safely renames files and updates imports/usages.                           |
| 5   | `codex &quot;Explain what this regex does: ^(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}$&quot;`                      | Outputs a step-by-step human explanation.                                  |
| 6   | `codex &quot;Carefully review this repo, and propose 3 high impact well-scoped PRs&quot;` | Suggests impactful PRs in the current codebase.                            |
| 7   | `codex &quot;Look for vulnerabilities and create a security review report&quot;`          | Finds and explains security bugs.                                          |

## Running with a prompt as input

You can also run Codex CLI with a prompt as input:

```shell
codex &quot;explain this codebase to me&quot;
```

```shell
codex --full-auto &quot;create the fanciest todo-list app&quot;
```

That&#039;s it - Codex will scaffold a file, run it inside a sandbox, install any
missing dependencies, and show you the live result. Approve the changes and
they&#039;ll be committed to your working directory.

## Using Open Source Models

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;--profile&lt;/code&gt; to use other models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Codex also allows you to use other providers that support the OpenAI Chat Completions (or Responses) API.

To do so, you must first define custom [providers](./config.md#model_providers) in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For example, the provider for a standard Ollama setup would be defined as follows:

```toml
[model_providers.ollama]
name = &quot;Ollama&quot;
base_url = &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1&quot;
```

The `base_url` will have `/chat/completions` appended to it to build the full URL for the request.

For providers that also require an `Authorization` header of the form `Bearer: SECRET`, an `env_key` can be specified, which indicates the environment variable to read to use as the value of `SECRET` when making a request:

```toml
[model_providers.openrouter]
name = &quot;OpenRouter&quot;
base_url = &quot;https://openrouter.ai/api/v1&quot;
env_key = &quot;OPENROUTER_API_KEY&quot;
```

Providers that speak the Responses API are also supported by adding `wire_api = &quot;responses&quot;` as part of the definition. Accessing OpenAI models via Azure is an example of such a provider, though it also requires specifying additional `query_params` that need to be appended to the request URL:

```toml
[model_providers.azure]
name = &quot;Azure&quot;
# Make sure you set the appropriate subdomain for this URL.
base_url = &quot;https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai&quot;
env_key = &quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;  # Or &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;, whichever you use.
# Newer versions appear to support the responses API, see https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/1321
query_params = { api-version = &quot;2025-04-01-preview&quot; }
wire_api = &quot;responses&quot;
```

Once you have defined a provider you wish to use, you can configure it as your default provider as follows:

```toml
model_provider = &quot;azure&quot;
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you find yourself experimenting with a variety of models and providers, then you likely want to invest in defining a _profile_ for each configuration like so:

```toml
[profiles.o3]
model_provider = &quot;azure&quot;
model = &quot;o3&quot;

[profiles.mistral]
model_provider = &quot;ollama&quot;
model = &quot;mistral&quot;
```

This way, you can specify one command-line argument (.e.g., `--profile o3`, `--profile mistral`) to override multiple settings together.

&lt;/details&gt;

Codex can run fully locally against an OpenAI-compatible OSS host (like Ollama) using the `--oss` flag:

- Interactive UI:
  - codex --oss
- Non-interactive (programmatic) mode:
  - echo &quot;Refactor utils&quot; | codex exec --oss

Model selection when using `--oss`:

- If you omit `-m/--model`, Codex defaults to -m gpt-oss:20b and will verify it exists locally (downloading if needed).
- To pick a different size, pass one of:
  - -m &quot;gpt-oss:20b&quot;
  - -m &quot;gpt-oss:120b&quot;

Point Codex at your own OSS host:

- By default, `--oss` talks to http://localhost:11434/v1.
- To use a different host, set one of these environment variables before running Codex:
  - CODEX_OSS_BASE_URL, for example:
    - CODEX_OSS_BASE_URL=&quot;http://my-ollama.example.com:11434/v1&quot; codex --oss -m gpt-oss:20b
  - or CODEX_OSS_PORT (when the host is localhost):
    - CODEX_OSS_PORT=11434 codex --oss

Advanced: you can persist this in your config instead of environment variables by overriding the built-in `oss` provider in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[model_providers.oss]
name = &quot;Open Source&quot;
base_url = &quot;http://my-ollama.example.com:11434/v1&quot;
```

### Platform sandboxing details

The mechanism Codex uses to implement the sandbox policy depends on your OS:

- **macOS 12+** uses **Apple Seatbelt** and runs commands using `sandbox-exec` with a profile (`-p`) that corresponds to the `--sandbox` that was specified.
- **Linux** uses a combination of Landlock/seccomp APIs to enforce the `sandbox` configuration.

Note that when running Linux in a containerized environment such as Docker, sandboxing may not work if the host/container configuration does not support the necessary Landlock/seccomp APIs. In such cases, we recommend configuring your Docker container so that it provides the sandbox guarantees you are looking for and then running `codex` with `--sandbox danger-full-access` (or, more simply, the `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` flag) within your container.

---

## Memory &amp; project docs

You can give Codex extra instructions and guidance using `AGENTS.md` files. Codex looks for `AGENTS.md` files in the following places, and merges them top-down:

1. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` - personal global guidance
2. `AGENTS.md` at repo root - shared project notes
3. `AGENTS.md` in the current working directory - sub-folder/feature specifics

---

## Non-interactive / CI mode

Run Codex head-less in pipelines. Example GitHub Action step:

```yaml
- name: Update changelog via Codex
  run: |
    npm install -g @openai/codex
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}&quot;
    codex exec --full-auto &quot;update CHANGELOG for next release&quot;
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Codex CLI can be configured to leverage MCP servers by defining an [`mcp_servers`](./codex-rs/config.md#mcp_servers) section in `~/.codex/config.toml`. It is intended to mirror how tools such as Claude and Cursor define `mcpServers` in their respective JSON config files, though the Codex format is slightly different since it uses TOML rather than JSON, e.g.:

```toml

&lt;/div&gt;

## Installation

The Wasmtime CLI can be installed on Linux and macOS (locally) with a small install
script:

```console
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```
This script installs into `$WASMTIME_HOME` (defaults to `$HOME/.wasmtime`), and executable is placed in `$WASMTIME_HOME/bin`.

After running the install script above, follow the on-screen instructions.

Windows or otherwise interested users can download installers and
binaries directly from the [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) page.

For additional installation options, refer to the [online book CLI installation page](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/cli-install.html).

Documentation on Wasmtime&#039;s currently supported versions can be found [in the
online book
documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html#current-versions).

## Example

If you&#039;ve got the [Rust compiler
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then you can take some Rust
source code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
```

and compile it into a WebAssembly component with:

```console
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
rustc hello.rs --target wasm32-wasip2
```

Once compiled, you can run your component:

```console
wasmtime hello.wasm
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Hello, world!
```

(Note: make sure you installed Rust using the [`rustup`][rustup] method in the official
instructions above, and do not have a copy of the Rust toolchain installed on
your system in some other way as well (e.g. the system package manager). Otherwise, the `rustup target add...`
command may not install the target for the correct copy of Rust.)

## Features

* **Fast**. Wasmtime is built on the optimizing [Cranelift] code generator to
  quickly generate high-quality machine code either at runtime or
  ahead-of-time. Wasmtime is optimized for efficient instantiation, low-overhead
  calls between the embedder and wasm, and scalability of concurrent instances.

* **[Secure]**. Wasmtime&#039;s development is strongly focused on correctness and
  security. Building on top of Rust&#039;s runtime safety guarantees, each Wasmtime
  feature goes through careful review and consideration via an [RFC
  process]. Once features are designed and implemented, they undergo 24/7
  fuzzing donated by [Google&#039;s OSS Fuzz]. As features stabilize they become part
  of a [release][release policy], and when things go wrong we have a
  well-defined [security policy] in place to quickly mitigate and patch any
  issues. We follow best practices for defense-in-depth and integrate
  protections and mitigations for issues like Spectre. Finally, we&#039;re working to
  push the state-of-the-art by collaborating with academic researchers to
  formally verify critical parts of Wasmtime and Cranelift.

* **[Configurable]**. Wasmtime uses sensible defaults, but can also be
  configured to provide more fine-grained control over things like CPU and
  memory consumption. Whether you want to run Wasmtime in a tiny environment or
  on massive servers with many concurrent instances, we&#039;ve got you covered.

* **[WASI]**. Wasmtime supports a rich set of APIs for interacting with the host
  environment through the [WASI standard](https://wasi.dev).

* **[Standards Compliant]**. Wasmtime passes the [official WebAssembly test
  suite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite), implements the [official C
  API of wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), and implements
  [future proposals to WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) as
  well. Wasmtime developers are intimately engaged with the WebAssembly
  standards process all along the way too.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cargo

Cargo downloads your Rust project’s dependencies and compiles your project.

**To start using Cargo**, learn more at [The Cargo Book].

**To start developing Cargo itself**, read the [Cargo Contributor Guide].

[The Cargo Book]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
[Cargo Contributor Guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo/contrib/

&gt; The Cargo binary distributed through with Rust is maintained by the Cargo
&gt; team for use by the wider ecosystem.
&gt; For all other uses of this crate (as a binary or library) this is maintained
&gt; by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo and not intended for external
&gt; use (except as a transitive dependency). This crate may make major changes to
&gt; its APIs.

## Code Status

[![CI](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=auto-cargo)](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Code documentation: &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/&gt;

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `cargo` and `rustc`
* A C compiler [for your platform](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)
* `git` (to clone this repository)

**Other requirements:**

The following are optional based on your platform and needs.

* `pkg-config` — This is used to help locate system packages, such as `libssl` headers/libraries. This may not be required in all cases, such as using vendored OpenSSL, or on Windows.
* OpenSSL — Only needed on Unix-like systems and only if the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature is not used.

  This requires the development headers, which can be obtained from the `libssl-dev` package on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` with apk or yum or the `openssl` package from Homebrew on macOS.

  If using the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature, then a static copy of OpenSSL will be built from source instead of using the system OpenSSL.
  This may require additional tools such as `perl` and `make`.

  On macOS, common installation directories from Homebrew, MacPorts, or pkgsrc will be checked. Otherwise it will fall back to `pkg-config`.

  On Windows, the system-provided Schannel will be used instead.

  LibreSSL is also supported.

**Optional system libraries:**

The build will automatically use vendored versions of the following libraries. However, if they are provided by the system and can be found with `pkg-config`, then the system libraries will be used instead:

* [`libcurl`](https://curl.se/libcurl/) — Used for network transfers.
* [`libgit2`](https://libgit2.org/) — Used for fetching git dependencies.
* [`libssh2`](https://www.libssh2.org/) — Used for SSH access to git repositories.
* [`libz`](https://zlib.net/) (AKA zlib) — Used by the above C libraries for data compression. (Rust code uses [`zlib-rs`](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/zlib-rs) instead.)

It is recommended to use the vendored versions as they are the versions that are tested to work with Cargo.

### Compiling

First, you&#039;ll want to check out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo.git
cd cargo
```

With `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.

[third-party-subcommands]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-cargo-subcommands


## Releases

Cargo releases coincide with Rust releases.
High level release notes are available as part of [Rust&#039;s release notes][rel].
Detailed release notes are available in the [changelog].

让小爱音箱「听见你的声音」，解锁无限可能。

![](./docs/images/cover.jpg)

## 简介

2017 年，当全球首款千万级销量的智能音箱诞生时，我们以为触摸到了未来。但很快发现，这些设备被困在「指令-响应」的牢笼里：

- 它听得见分贝，却听不懂情感
- 它能执行命令，却不会主动思考
- 它有千万用户，却只有一套思维

我们曾幻想中的&quot;贾维斯&quot;级人工智能，在现实场景中沦为&quot;天气预报+音乐播放器&quot;。

**真正的智能不应被预设的代码逻辑所束缚，而应像生命体般在交互中进化。**

在上一个 [MiGPT](https://github.com/idootop/mi-gpt) 项目中，我们已经实现将 ChatGPT 接入到小爱音箱。

这一次 [Open-XiaoAI](https://github.com/idootop/open-xiaoai) 再次进化，直接接管小爱音箱的“耳朵”和“嘴巴”，

通过多模态大模型和 AI Agent，将小爱音箱的潜力完全释放，解锁无限可能。

**未来由你定义!**

## 你的声音 + 小爱音箱 = 无限可能

## About

Cairo is the first Turing-complete language for creating provable programs for general computation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Setup Rust:
```bash
rustup override set stable &amp;&amp; rustup update
```

Ensure Rust was installed correctly by running the following from the root project directory:
```bash
cargo test
```

### Compiling and running Cairo files

Compile Cairo to Sierra:
```bash
cargo run --bin cairo-compile -- --single-file /path/to/input.cairo /path/to/output.sierra --replace-ids
```

Compile Sierra to casm (Cairo assembly):
```bash
cargo run --bin sierra-compile -- /path/to/input.sierra /path/to/output.casm
```

Run Cairo code directly:
```bash
cargo run --bin cairo-run -- --single-file /path/to/file.cairo
```

See more information [here](./crates/cairo-lang-runner/README.md). You can also find Cairo examples in the [examples](./examples) directory.

For running tests specifically, see here: [cairo-test](./crates/cairo-lang-test-runner/README.md)

### Compiling Starknet Contracts

Compile a Starknet Contract to a Sierra ContractClass:
```bash
cargo run --bin starknet-compile -- --single-file /path/to/input.cairo /path/to/output.json
```

Or specify the contract path if multiple contracts are defined in the same project:
```bash
cargo run --bin starknet-compile -- /path/to/input/crate /path/to/output.json --contract-path path::to::contract
```

Compile the ContractClass of a CompiledClass:
```bash
cargo run --bin starknet-sierra-compile -- /path/to/input.json /path/to/output.casm
```

## Roadmap

The next milestone is to reach feature parity with the old Cairo version.
You can track the exact progress [here](./docs/FEATURE_PARITY.md).

## Support

- We encourage developers to ask and answer questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cairo-lang).
- Contact options listed on [this GitHub profile](https://github.com/starkware-libs)

## Project assistance

If you want to say **thank you** or/and support active development of Cairo:

- Add a [GitHub Star](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) to the project.
- Tweet about your Cairo work.
- Write interesting articles about the project on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Medium](https://medium.com/) or your personal blog.

Together, we can make Cairo **better**!

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

[Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) is a framework providing several convenient developer tools for writing Solana programs (sometimes called &#039;smart contracts&#039;).

- Rust eDSL for writing Solana programs
- [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) specification
- TypeScript package for generating clients from IDL
- CLI and workspace management for developing complete applications

Anchor is the most popular framework for Solana programs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re familiar with developing in Ethereum&#039;s [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), then using Anchor will be familiar. Although the DSL syntax and semantics are targeted at Solana, the high level flow of writing RPC request handlers, emitting an IDL, and generating clients from IDL is the same.

## Getting Started

For a quickstart guide and in depth tutorials, see the [Anchor book](https://book.anchor-lang.com) and the [Anchor documentation](https://anchor-lang.com).

To jump straight to examples, go [here](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/tree/master/examples). For the latest Rust and TypeScript API documentation, see [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang) and the [typedoc](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/clients/typescript).

## Examples

Here&#039;s a counter program, where only the designated `authority`
can increment the count.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!(&quot;Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS&quot;);

#[program]
mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context&lt;Initialize&gt;, start: u64) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.authority = *ctx.accounts.authority.key;
        counter.count = start;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context&lt;Increment&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count += 1;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(init, payer = authority, space = 48)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
    pub system_program: Program&lt;&#039;info, System&gt;,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(mut, has_one = authority)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
}

#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub count: u64,
}
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre>ripgrep (rg)
------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

If you&#039;re a **Rust programmer**, ripgrep can be installed with `cargo`.

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.88.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.88.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your friendly neighborhood package manager).
Then you just need to add MUSL support to your Rust toolchain and rebuild
ripgrep, which yields a fully static executable:

```
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Applying the `--features` flag from above works as expected. If you want to
build a static executable with MUSL and with PCRE2, then you will need to have
`musl-gcc` installed, which might be in a separate package from the actual
MUSL library, depending on your Linux distribution.

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ — the state of your application
* __Messages__ — user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ — a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ — a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(&quot;A cool counter&quot;, Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.
