Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. Its based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Rust Programming Language

![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source of &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot; book.

[The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch].

[nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition

You can also read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with
the latest [stable], [beta], or [nightly] Rust releases. Be aware that issues
in those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those
releases are updated less frequently.

[stable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
[beta]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/
[nightly]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/

See the [releases] to download just the code of all the code listings that appear in the book.

[releases]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/releases

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same version that
rust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook
[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook --locked --version &lt;version_num&gt;
```

The book also uses two mdbook plugins which are part of this repository. If you
do not install them, you will see warnings when building and the output will not
look right, but you _will_ still be able to build the book. To use the plugins,
you should run:

```bash
$ cargo install --locked --path packages/mdbook-trpl --force
```

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in
your web browser.

_Firefox:_

```bash
$ firefox book/index.html                       # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Firefox&quot; book/index.html             # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;firefox.exe&quot; .\book\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start firefox.exe .\book\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
```

_Chrome:_

```bash
$ google-chrome book/index.html                 # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Google Chrome&quot; book/index.html       # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;chrome.exe&quot; .\book\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start chrome.exe .\book\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ cd packages/trpl
$ mdbook test --library-path packages/trpl/target/debug/deps
```

## Contributing

We&#039;d love your help! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] to learn about the
kinds of contributions we&#039;re looking for.

[contrib]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

Because the book is [printed][nostarch], and because we want
to keep the online version of the book close to the print version when
possible, it may take longer than you&#039;re used to for us to address your issue
or pull request.

So far, we&#039;ve been doing a larger revision to coincide with [Rust Editions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/). Between those larger
revisions, we will only be correcting errors. If your issue or pull request
isn&#039;t strictly fixing an error, it might sit until the next time that we&#039;re
working on a large revision: expect on the order of months or years. Thank you
for your patience!

### Translations

We&#039;d love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on
a new language! We&#039;re waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages
before we merge any in, but feel free to start!

[Translations]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATranslations
[mdbook support]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/5

## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
script available in the `ci` directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words,
which is provided in `ci/dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false
positive (say, you used the word `BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid),
you need to add this word to `ci/dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for
consistency).

## Core primitives

The basic primitives Restate offers to simplify application development are the following:

* **Reliable Execution**: Restate guarantees code runs to completion. Failures result in retries that use the [Durable Execution mechanism](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/durable_execution) to recover partial progress and prevent re-executing completed steps.
* **Reliable Communication**: Services communicate with exactly-once semantics: whether it&#039;s [request-response, one-way messages, or scheduled tasks](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/invocations). Restate reliably delivers messages and uses Durable Execution to ensure no losses or duplicates can happen.
* **Durable Promises and Timers**: Register Promises/Futures and timers in Restate to make them resilient to failures (e.g. sleep, webhooks, timers). Restate can recover them across failures, processes, and time.
* **Consistent State**: Implement [stateful entities](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/services) with isolated K/V state per entity. Restate persists the K/V state updates together with the execution progress to ensure consistent state. Restate attaches the K/V state to the request on invocation, and writes it back upon completion. This is particularly efficient for FaaS deployments (stateful serverless, yay!).
* **Suspending User Code**: long-running code suspends when awaiting on a Promise/Future and resumes when that promise is resolved. This is particularly useful in combination with serverless deployments.
* **Observability &amp; Introspection**: Restate includes a UI and CLI to inspect the [state of your application](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/introspection) across services and invocations. Restate automatically generates Open Telemetry traces for the interactions between handlers.

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/harper.js)

Harper is an English grammar checker designed to be _just right._
I created it after years of dealing with the shortcomings of the competition.

Grammarly was too expensive and too overbearing.
Its suggestions lacked context, and were often just plain _wrong_.
Not to mention: it&#039;s a privacy nightmare.
Everything you write with Grammarly is sent to their servers.
Their privacy policy claims they don&#039;t sell the data, but that doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t use it to train large language models and god knows what else.
Not only that, but the round-trip-time of the network request makes revising your work all the more tedious.

LanguageTool is great, if you have gigabytes of RAM to spare and are willing to download the ~16GB n-gram dataset.
Besides the memory requirements, I found LanguageTool too slow: it would take several seconds to lint even a moderate-size document.

That&#039;s why I created Harper: it is the grammar checker that fits my needs.
Not only does it take milliseconds to lint a document, take less than 1/50th of LanguageTool&#039;s memory footprint,
but it is also completely private.

Harper is even small enough to load via [WebAssembly.](https://writewithharper.com)

## Language Support

Harper currently only supports English, but the core is extensible to support other languages, so we welcome contributions that allow for other language support.

## Performance Issues

We consider long lint times bugs.
If you encounter any significant performance issues, please create an issue on the topic.

If you find a fix to any performance issue, we would appreciate the contribution.
Just please make sure to read [our contribution guidelines first.](https://github.com/automattic/harper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Candle is a minimalist ML framework for Rust with a focus on performance (including GPU support) 
and ease of use. Try our online demos: 
[whisper](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-whisper),
[LLaMA2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2),
[T5](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/Candle-T5-Generation-Wasm),
[yolo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-yolo),
[Segment
Anything](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/candle-segment-anything-wasm).

## Get started

Make sure that you have [`candle-core`](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/tree/main/candle-core) correctly installed as described in [**Installation**](https://huggingface.github.io/candle/guide/installation.html).

Let&#039;s see how to run a simple matrix multiplication.
Write the following to your `myapp/src/main.rs` file:
```rust
use candle_core::{Device, Tensor};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let device = Device::Cpu;

    let a = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (2, 3), &amp;device)?;
    let b = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (3, 4), &amp;device)?;

    let c = a.matmul(&amp;b)?;
    println!(&quot;{c}&quot;);
    Ok(())
}
```

`cargo run` should display a tensor of shape `Tensor[[2, 4], f32]`.


Having installed `candle` with Cuda support, simply define the `device` to be on GPU:

```diff
- let device = Device::Cpu;
+ let device = Device::new_cuda(0)?;
```

For more advanced examples, please have a look at the following section.

you have cuDNN installed, use `--features cudnn` for even more speedups.

There are also some wasm examples for whisper and
[llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c). You can either build them with
`trunk` or try them online:
[whisper](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-whisper),
[llama2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2),
[T5](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/Candle-T5-Generation-Wasm),

## FAQ

### Why should I use Candle?

&lt;!--- ANCHOR: goals ---&gt;

Candle&#039;s core goal is to *make serverless inference possible*. Full machine learning frameworks like PyTorch
are very large, which makes creating instances on a cluster slow. Candle allows deployment of lightweight
binaries.

Secondly, Candle lets you *remove Python* from production workloads. Python overhead can seriously hurt performance,
and the [GIL](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-python-gil-past-present-and-future/) is a notorious source of headaches.

Finally, Rust is cool! A lot of the HF ecosystem already has Rust crates, like [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) and [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).

&lt;!--- ANCHOR_END: goals ---&gt;

### Other ML frameworks

- [dfdx](https://github.com/coreylowman/dfdx) is a formidable crate, with shapes being included
  in types. This prevents a lot of headaches by getting the compiler to complain about shape mismatches right off the bat.
  However, we found that some features still require nightly, and writing code can be a bit daunting for non rust experts.

  We&#039;re leveraging and contributing to other core crates for the runtime so hopefully both crates can benefit from each
  other.

- [burn](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn) is a general crate that can leverage multiple backends so you can choose the best
  engine for your workload.

- [tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs.git) Bindings to the torch library in Rust. Extremely versatile, but they 
  bring in the entire torch library into the runtime. The main contributor of `tch-rs` is also involved in the development
  of `candle`.

### Common Errors

#### Missing symbols when compiling with the mkl feature.

If you get some missing symbols when compiling binaries/tests using the mkl
or accelerate features, e.g. for mkl you get:
```
  = note: /usr/bin/ld: (....o): in function `blas::sgemm&#039;:
          .../blas-0.22.0/src/lib.rs:1944: undefined reference to `sgemm_&#039; collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  = note: some `extern` functions couldn&#039;t be found; some native libraries may need to be installed or have their path specified
  = note: use the `-l` flag to specify native libraries to link
  = note: use the `cargo:rustc-link-lib` directive to specify the native libraries to link with Cargo
```
or for accelerate:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
            &quot;_dgemm_&quot;, referenced from:
                candle_core::accelerate::dgemm::h1b71a038552bcabe in libcandle_core...
            &quot;_sgemm_&quot;, referenced from:
                candle_core::accelerate::sgemm::h2cf21c592cba3c47 in libcandle_core...
          ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
```

This is likely due to a missing linker flag that was needed to enable the mkl library. You
can try adding the following for mkl at the top of your binary:
```rust
extern crate intel_mkl_src;
```
or for accelerate:
```rust
extern crate accelerate_src;
```

#### Cannot run the LLaMA examples: access to source requires login credentials

```
Error: request error: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf/resolve/main/tokenizer.json: status code 401
```

This is likely because you&#039;re not permissioned for the LLaMA-v2 model. To fix
this, you have to register on the huggingface-hub, accept the [LLaMA-v2 model
conditions](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf), and set up your
authentication token. See issue
[#350](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/350) for more details.

#### Missing cute/cutlass headers when compiling flash-attn

```
  In file included from kernels/flash_fwd_launch_template.h:11:0,
                   from kernels/flash_fwd_hdim224_fp16_sm80.cu:5:

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Workspaces) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Window-Rules#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Screencasting#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Tabs)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Layout#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: no built-in support, but xwayland-satellite is [easy to set up](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-xwayland-satellite) and works very well.
    - Steam and games, including Proton: work perfectly through xwayland-satellite.
    - JetBrains IDEs, Ghidra: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Discord and other Electron apps: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Chromium and VSCode: work perfectly natively on Wayland with the right flags.
    - X11 apps that want to position windows or bars at specific screen coordinates: won&#039;t work well; you can run them in a nested compositor like [labwc](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-the-labwc-wayland-compositor) or [rootful Xwayland](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#directly-running-xwayland-in-rootful-mode).
    - Display scaling (integer or fractional) keeps X11 apps crisp, but you need the latest xwayland-satellite.
    For games, you can run them in [gamescope] at native resolution, even with display scaling.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

**Deep learning at the speed of light.**

Luminal is a deep learning library that **generates optimized code** to achieve high performance.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]  
&gt; Recently significant work is happening to focus much more on a search-first compiler with the goal of discovering advanced kernels like FlashAttention automatically. See progress on the `next` branch.

```rust
use luminal::prelude::*;

// Setup graph and tensors
let mut cx = Graph::new();
let a = cx.tensor((3, 1)).set([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]);
let b = cx.tensor((1, 4)).set([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]]);

// Do math...
let mut c = a.matmul(b).retrieve();

// Compile and run graph
cx.compile(&lt;(GenericCompiler, CPUCompiler)&gt;::default(), &amp;mut c);
cx.execute();

// Get result
println!(&quot;Result: {:?}&quot;, c);
```

## Getting Started
**Llama 3 8B**
- the below is a quick example of how you can run Llama 3 8B locally using Luminal
    - to go indepth on this example check out [the documentation here](https://github.com/jafioti/luminal/tree/main/examples/llama/README.md)
```bash
cd ./examples/llama
# Download the model
bash ./setup/setup.sh
# Run the model
cargo run --release --features metal    # MacOS (Recommended)
cargo run --release --features cuda     # Nvidia
cargo run --release                     # CPU
```

## Features
### Speed
Luminal can run Q8 Llama 3 8B on M-series Macbooks at 15-25 tokens per second. The goal is to become the fastest ML framework for any model on any device.

### Simplicity
The core of luminal is and always will be minimal. It should be possible to understand the entire core library in an afternoon.

### RISC-style architecture
Everything in luminal boils down to 12 primitive ops:
- Unary - `Log2, Exp2, Sin, Sqrt, Recip`
- Binary - `Add, Mul, Mod, LessThan`
- Other - `SumReduce, MaxReduce, Contiguous`

These ops are enough to support transformers, convnets, etc.

### Speed
We compile these ops into complex GPU kernels, so even though our ops are simple, we get high performance through the power of compilers! This is how we overcome the typical RISC disadvantages, btw. 

### Native
The current ML ecosystem is too fragmented, and the solution isn&#039;t another layer of abstraction. Luminal is written in rust, and interacts directly with the CUDA / Metal APIs. No indirections or abstractions, docker containers, or virtual environments. Just a statically-linked rust crate.

### Validated against Pytorch
Correctness matters. So we write as much tests as possible to cover all ops and verify they work the same as an equivalent Pytorch implementation. ([Improvements needed!](https://github.com/jafioti/luminal/issues/20))

## Ideology
### Why does this look so different from other DL libraries?
Most deep learning libraries are eager-first, meaning each op call directly operates on the data. In PyTorch, when you see `x + y`, the addition actually happens right there. This is great for debugging because it works exactly as most developers expect.

However, this isn&#039;t great for performance. What makes sense for a developer doesn&#039;t work well for the machine, in the same way that no one writes assembly by hand. Most libraries try to fix this problem by tacking on operator fusion or JIT compilation to try to change the compilation flow to something better for the machine. Turns out this is [super](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/dynamo/index.html) [difficult](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html) [even](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) [for](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fx.html#torch.fx.symbolic_trace) Pytorch!

### Compile everything
A core tenet of Luminal is ahead-of-time compilation. Whenever possible, push everything to compile time and leave nothing to run time. Luminal takes an approach more similar to [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), and [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad). Everything&#039;s static here. When you write out an expression like `x + y`, no actual computation happens. The operation is recorded to a directed acyclic computation graph for execution later. Only once `graph.execute()` is ran does the computation happen. *But isn&#039;t that just lazy execution?* Yes it is! But in luminal **everything is done this way**. All neural networks are built up as one or a few static computation graphs, compiled, and executed later.

**But why?**

A consequence of this is that the actual computation that gets ran can be radically different than the code that was written. Since we have an entire neural network fully represented in a compute graph, our compilers have global knowledge. This means we can push most ML complexity to the compilers. For instance, devices, datatypes, and execution schedules are all handled by compliers. Even autograd is handled by a compiler!

Now we can do:
- Aggressive kernel fusion
- Shape-specific kernels compiled at runtime
- Devices and Dtypes are handled through compilers (just run the CUDA compiler to convert the graph to use CUDA kernels, then the fp16 compiler to convert to half-precision kernels)
- Networks can be written in generic code, but compiled and ran fast on hyper-specific architectures (try writing a PyTorch network that works with both TF32 dtypes and TPUs; get ready for if statement hell...)

### View the Graph
Once you&#039;ve written all your computation code, run `cx.display()` to see the entire computation graph in all it&#039;s glory. Pretty messy looking! Now run `cx.compile(GenericCompiler::default())` and display the graph again. Much better.

## Where are we?
- Metal and Cuda are supported for running models on Macs and Nvidia GPUs respectively, in both full and half precision.
- Performance on M-series macs with LLMs is within 20% of llama.cpp (a *heavily* optimized library)
- Full training support with graph-based autograd.
- Llama 3, Phi 3, Whisper and Yolo v8 are implemented in `examples/`. See instructions above for running.
- We have a small library of NN modules in `luminal_nn`, including transformers.
- A significant amount of high-level ops are implemented in `hl_ops`. We are aiming to match the most used ~80% of the pytorch api.
- The aim for 0.3 is to achieve SOTA performance on an M1 pro (50 tok/s), and near SOTA on single nvidia gpus (&gt;100 tok/s), as well as support many mainstream models (Whisper, Stable Diffusion, Yolo v9, etc.) See the tracking issue [here](https://github.com/jafioti/luminal/issues/29)

Some things on the roadmap:
- Optimize cuda and metal matmul kernels
- Fine-grained metal and cuda IR
- Build benchmarking suite to test against other libs
- Distributed data, pipeline and tensor parallel.
- Beat PT 2.0 perf on LLM training
- Write compiler for quantum photonic retro encabulator
- Build dyson swarm

## Advanced Configuration

### Provider Configuration

Forge supports multiple AI providers. Below are setup instructions for each supported provider:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;forgecode.dev (Recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
FORGE_KEY=ForgeKey
```

To use Forgecode&#039;s provider with Forge:

1. Visit [https://app.forgecode.dev/](https://app.forgecode.dev/)
2. Login with your existing credentials or create a new account
3. Once logged in, your account will automatically enable the Forge Provider

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenRouter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=&lt;your_openrouter_api_key&gt;
```

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requesty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
REQUESTY_API_KEY=&lt;your_requesty_api_key&gt;
```

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;x-ai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
XAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_xai_api_key&gt;
```

switch the model using `/model` command in the Forge CLI.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_openai_api_key&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: o3-mini-high
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&lt;your_anthropic_api_key&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: claude-3.7-sonnet
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Vertex AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
PROJECT_ID=&lt;your_project_id&gt;
LOCATION=&lt;your_location&gt;
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;vertex_ai_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/endpoints/openapi
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-7-sonnet
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI-Compatible Providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_provider_api_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=&lt;your_provider_url&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: &lt;provider-specific-model&gt;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groq&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_groq_api_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Bedrock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

To use Amazon Bedrock models with Forge, you&#039;ll need to first set up the [Bedrock Access Gateway](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway):

1. **Set up Bedrock Access Gateway**:

   - Follow the deployment steps in the [Bedrock Access Gateway repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway)
   - Create your own API key in Secrets Manager
   - Deploy the CloudFormation stack
   - Note your API Base URL from the CloudFormation outputs

2. **Create these files in your project directory**:

   ```bash
   # .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_bedrock_gateway_api_key&gt;
   OPENAI_URL=&lt;your_bedrock_gateway_base_url&gt;
   ```

   ```yaml
   # forge.yaml
   model: anthropic.claude-3-opus
   ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

### forge.yaml Configuration Options

The `forge.yaml` file supports several advanced configuration options that let you customize Forge&#039;s behavior.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Add your own guidelines that all agents should follow when generating responses.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
custom_rules: |
  1. Always add comprehensive error handling to any code you write.
  2. Include unit tests for all new functions.
  3. Follow our team&#039;s naming convention: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes.
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Define custom commands as shortcuts for repetitive prompts:

```yaml
# forge.yaml
commands:
  - name: &#039;refactor&#039;
    description: &#039;Refactor selected code&#039;
    prompt: &#039;Please refactor this code to improve readability and performance&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Specify the default AI model to use for all agents in the workflow.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: &#039;claude-3.7-sonnet&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Walker Depth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Control how deeply Forge traverses your project directory structure when gathering context.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
max_walker_depth: 3 # Limit directory traversal to 3 levels deep
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Adjust the creativity and randomness in AI responses. Lower values (0.0-0.3) produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (0.7-2.0) generate more diverse and creative results.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
temperature: 0.7 # Balanced creativity and focus
```

&lt;/details&gt;

---

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The MCP feature allows AI agents to communicate with external tools and services. This implementation follows Anthropic&#039;s [Model Context Protocol](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp) design.

### MCP Configuration

Configure MCP servers using the CLI:

```bash
# List all MCP servers
forge mcp list

# Add a new server
forge mcp add

# Add a server using JSON format
forge mcp add-json

# Get server details
forge mcp get

# Remove a server
forge mcp remove
```

Or manually create a `.mcp.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
	&quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
		&quot;server_name&quot;: {
			&quot;command&quot;: &quot;command_to_execute&quot;,
			&quot;args&quot;: [&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;],
			&quot;env&quot;: { &quot;ENV_VAR&quot;: &quot;value&quot; }
		},
		&quot;another_server&quot;: {
			&quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000/events&quot;
		}
	}
}
```

MCP configurations are read from two locations (in order of precedence):

1. Local configuration (project-specific)
2. User configuration (user-specific)

### Example Use Cases

MCP can be used for various integrations:

- Web browser automation
- External API interactions
- Tool integration
- Custom service connections

### Usage in Multi-Agent Workflows

MCP tools can be used as part of multi-agent workflows, allowing specialized agents to interact with external systems as part of a collaborative problem-solving approach.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Docker

```shell
model=Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

And then you can make requests like

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/embed \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{&quot;inputs&quot;:&quot;What is Deep Learning?&quot;}&#039; \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039;
```

**Note:** To use GPUs, you need to install
the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).
NVIDIA drivers on your machine need to be compatible with CUDA version 12.2 or higher.

To see all options to serve your models:

```console
$ text-embeddings-router --help
Text Embedding Webserver

Usage: text-embeddings-router [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --model-id &lt;MODEL_ID&gt;
          The name of the model to load. Can be a MODEL_ID as listed on &lt;https://hf.co/models&gt; like `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`. Or it can be a local directory containing the necessary files as saved by `save_pretrained(...)` methods of transformers

          [env: MODEL_ID=]
          [default: BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5]

      --revision &lt;REVISION&gt;
          The actual revision of the model if you&#039;re referring to a model on the hub. You can use a specific commit id or a branch like `refs/pr/2`

          [env: REVISION=]

      --tokenization-workers &lt;TOKENIZATION_WORKERS&gt;
          Optionally control the number of tokenizer workers used for payload tokenization, validation and truncation. Default to the number of CPU cores on the machine

          [env: TOKENIZATION_WORKERS=]

      --dtype &lt;DTYPE&gt;
          The dtype to be forced upon the model

          [env: DTYPE=]
          [possible values: float16, float32]

      --pooling &lt;POOLING&gt;
          Optionally control the pooling method for embedding models.

          If `pooling` is not set, the pooling configuration will be parsed from the model `1_Pooling/config.json` configuration.

          If `pooling` is set, it will override the model pooling configuration

          [env: POOLING=]

          Possible values:
          - cls:        Select the CLS token as embedding
          - mean:       Apply Mean pooling to the model embeddings
          - splade:     Apply SPLADE (Sparse Lexical and Expansion) to the model embeddings. This option is only available if the loaded model is a `ForMaskedLM` Transformer model
          - last-token: Select the last token as embedding

      --max-concurrent-requests &lt;MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS&gt;
          The maximum amount of concurrent requests for this particular deployment. Having a low limit will refuse clients requests instead of having them wait for too long and is usually good to handle backpressure correctly

          [env: MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=]
          [default: 512]

      --max-batch-tokens &lt;MAX_BATCH_TOKENS&gt;
          **IMPORTANT** This is one critical control to allow maximum usage of the available hardware.

          This represents the total amount of potential tokens within a batch.

          For `max_batch_tokens=1000`, you could fit `10` queries of `total_tokens=100` or a single query of `1000` tokens.

          Overall this number should be the largest possible until the model is compute bound. Since the actual memory overhead depends on the model implementation, text-embeddings-inference cannot infer this number automatically.

          [env: MAX_BATCH_TOKENS=]
          [default: 16384]

      --max-batch-requests &lt;MAX_BATCH_REQUESTS&gt;
          Optionally control the maximum number of individual requests in a batch

          [env: MAX_BATCH_REQUESTS=]

      --max-client-batch-size &lt;MAX_CLIENT_BATCH_SIZE&gt;
          Control the maximum number of inputs that a client can send in a single request

          [env: MAX_CLIENT_BATCH_SIZE=]
          [default: 32]

      --auto-truncate
          Automatically truncate inputs that are longer than the maximum supported size

          Unused for gRPC servers

          [env: AUTO_TRUNCATE=]

      --default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;
          The name of the prompt that should be used by default for encoding. If not set, no prompt will be applied.

          Must be a key in the `sentence-transformers` configuration `prompts` dictionary.

          For example if ``default_prompt_name`` is &quot;query&quot; and the ``prompts`` is {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;query: &quot;, ...}, then the sentence &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot; will be encoded as &quot;query: What is the capital of France?&quot; because the prompt text will be prepended before any text to encode.

          The argument &#039;--default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;&#039; cannot be used with &#039;--default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;`

          [env: DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME=]

      --default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;
          The prompt that should be used by default for encoding. If not set, no prompt will be applied.

          For example if ``default_prompt`` is &quot;query: &quot; then the sentence &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot; will be encoded as &quot;query: What is the capital of France?&quot; because the prompt text will be prepended before any text to encode.

          The argument &#039;--default-prompt &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT&gt;&#039; cannot be used with &#039;--default-prompt-name &lt;DEFAULT_PROMPT_NAME&gt;`

          [env: DEFAULT_PROMPT=]

      --hf-token &lt;HF_TOKEN&gt;
          Your Hugging Face Hub token

          [env: HF_TOKEN=]

      --hostname &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;
          The IP address to listen on

          [env: HOSTNAME=]
          [default: 0.0.0.0]

      -p, --port &lt;PORT&gt;
          The port to listen on

          [env: PORT=]
          [default: 3000]

      --uds-path &lt;UDS_PATH&gt;
          The name of the unix socket some text-embeddings-inference backends will use as they communicate internally with gRPC

          [env: UDS_PATH=]
          [default: /tmp/text-embeddings-inference-server]

      --huggingface-hub-cache &lt;HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE&gt;
          The location of the huggingface hub cache. Used to override the location if you want to provide a mounted disk for instance

          [env: HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=]

      --payload-limit &lt;PAYLOAD_LIMIT&gt;
          Payload size limit in bytes

          Default is 2MB

          [env: PAYLOAD_LIMIT=]
          [default: 2000000]

      --api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;
          Set an api key for request authorization.

          By default the server responds to every request. With an api key set, the requests must have the Authorization header set with the api key as Bearer token.

          [env: API_KEY=]

      --json-output
          Outputs the logs in JSON format (useful for telemetry)

          [env: JSON_OUTPUT=]

      --disable-spans
          [env: DISABLE_SPANS=]

      --otlp-endpoint &lt;OTLP_ENDPOINT&gt;
          The grpc endpoint for opentelemetry. Telemetry is sent to this endpoint as OTLP over gRPC. e.g. `http://localhost:4317`

          [env: OTLP_ENDPOINT=]

      --otlp-service-name &lt;OTLP_SERVICE_NAME&gt;
          The service name for opentelemetry. e.g. `text-embeddings-inference.server`

          [env: OTLP_SERVICE_NAME=]
          [default: text-embeddings-inference.server]

      --prometheus-port &lt;PROMETHEUS_PORT&gt;
          The Prometheus port to listen on

          [env: PROMETHEUS_PORT=]
          [default: 9000]

      --cors-allow-origin &lt;CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN&gt;
          Unused for gRPC servers

          [env: CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=]

      -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with &#039;-h&#039;)

      -V, --version
          Print version
```

### Docker Images

Text Embeddings Inference ships with multiple Docker images that you can use to target a specific backend:

| Architecture                        | Image                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU                                 | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:cpu-1.7                   |
| Volta                               | NOT SUPPORTED                                                           |
| Turing (T4, RTX 2000 series, ...)   | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:turing-1.7 (experimental) |
| Ampere 80 (A100, A30)               | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7                       |
| Ampere 86 (A10, A40, ...)           | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:86-1.7                    |
| Ada Lovelace (RTX 4000 series, ...) | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:89-1.7                    |
| Hopper (H100)                       | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:hopper-1.7 (experimental) |

**Warning**: Flash Attention is turned off by default for the Turing image as it suffers from precision issues.
You can turn Flash Attention v1 ON by using the `USE_FLASH_ATTENTION=True` environment variable.

### API documentation

You can consult the OpenAPI documentation of the `text-embeddings-inference` REST API using the `/docs` route.
The Swagger UI is also available
at: [https://huggingface.github.io/text-embeddings-inference](https://huggingface.github.io/text-embeddings-inference).

### Using a private or gated model

You have the option to utilize the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable for configuring the token employed by
`text-embeddings-inference`. This allows you to gain access to protected resources.

For example:

1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Copy your cli READ token
3. Export `HF_TOKEN=&lt;your cli READ token&gt;`

or with Docker:

```shell
model=&lt;your private model&gt;
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run
token=&lt;your cli READ token&gt;

docker run --gpus all -e HF_TOKEN=$token -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

### Air gapped deployment

To deploy Text Embeddings Inference in an air-gapped environment, first download the weights and then mount them inside
the container using a volume.

For example:

```shell
# (Optional) create a `models` directory
mkdir models
cd models

# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B

# Set the models directory as the volume path
volume=$PWD

# Mount the models directory inside the container with a volume and set the model ID
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id /data/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
```

### Using Re-rankers models

`text-embeddings-inference` v0.4.0 added support for CamemBERT, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, and GTE Sequence Classification models.
Re-rankers models are Sequence Classification cross-encoders models with a single class that scores the similarity
between a query and a text.

See [this blogpost](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/boosting-rag-picking-the-best-embedding-reranker-models-42d079022e83) by
the LlamaIndex team to understand how you can use re-rankers models in your RAG pipeline to improve
downstream performance.

```shell
model=BAAI/bge-reranker-large
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

And then you can rank the similarity between a query and a list of texts with:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/rerank \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;What is Deep Learning?&quot;, &quot;texts&quot;: [&quot;Deep Learning is not...&quot;, &quot;Deep learning is...&quot;]}&#039; \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039;
```

### Using Sequence Classification models

You can also use classic Sequence Classification models like `SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions`:

```shell
model=SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $model
```

Once you have deployed the model you can use the `predict` endpoint to get the emotions most associated with an input:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/predict \
    -X POST \
    -d &#039;{&quot;inputs&quot;:&quot;I like you.&quot;}&#039; \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039;
```

### Using SPLADE pooling

You can choose to activate SPLADE pooling for Bert and Distilbert MaskedLM architectures:

```shell
model=naver/efficient-splade-VI-BT-large-query
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7 --model-id $mod

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ˈdiːnoʊ/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell

```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

&lt;/p&gt;

Provides an implementation of today&#039;s most used tokenizers, with a focus on performance and
versatility.

## Main features:

 - Train new vocabularies and tokenize, using today&#039;s most used tokenizers.
 - Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation. Takes
   less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server&#039;s CPU.
 - Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.
 - Designed for research and production.
 - Normalization comes with alignments tracking. It&#039;s always possible to get the part of the
   original sentence that corresponds to a given token.
 - Does all the pre-processing: Truncate, Pad, add the special tokens your model needs.

## Performances
Performances can vary depending on hardware, but running the [~/bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py](bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py) should give the following on a g6 aws instance:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b913d4b-e488-4cbc-b542-f90a6c40643d)


## Bindings

We provide bindings to the following languages (more to come!):
  - [Rust](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/tokenizers) (Original implementation)
  - [Python](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/python)
  - [Node.js](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/node)
  - [Ruby](https://github.com/ankane/tokenizers-ruby) (Contributed by @ankane, external repo)

## Installation

You can install from source using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers.git#subdirectory=bindings/python
```

our install the released versions with

```bash
pip install tokenizers
```
 
## Quick example using Python:

Choose your model between Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece or Unigram and instantiate a tokenizer:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE

tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())
```

You can customize how pre-tokenization (e.g., splitting into words) is done:

```python
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()
```

Then training your tokenizer on a set of files just takes two lines of codes:

```python
from tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer

trainer = BpeTrainer(special_tokens=[&quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;[CLS]&quot;, &quot;[SEP]&quot;, &quot;[PAD]&quot;, &quot;[MASK]&quot;])
tokenizer.train(files=[&quot;wiki.train.raw&quot;, &quot;wiki.valid.raw&quot;, &quot;wiki.test.raw&quot;], trainer=trainer)
```

Once your tokenizer is trained, encode any text with just one line:
```python
output = tokenizer.encode(&quot;Hello, y&#039;all! How are you 😁 ?&quot;)
print(output.tokens)
# [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;&#039;&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;How&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;?&quot;]
```

[Ratatui][Ratatui Website] (_ˌræ.təˈtu.i_) is a Rust crate for cooking up terminal user interfaces
(TUIs). It provides a simple and flexible way to create text-based user interfaces in the terminal,
which can be used for command-line applications, dashboards, and other interactive console programs.

## Quickstart

Ratatui has [templates] available to help you get started quickly. You can use the
[`cargo-generate`] command to create a new project with Ratatui:

```shell
cargo install --locked cargo-generate
cargo generate ratatui/templates
```

Selecting the Hello World template produces the following application:

```rust
use color_eyre::Result;
use crossterm::event::{self, Event};
use ratatui::{DefaultTerminal, Frame};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    color_eyre::install()?;
    let terminal = ratatui::init();
    let result = run(terminal);
    ratatui::restore();
    result
}

fn run(mut terminal: DefaultTerminal) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    loop {
        terminal.draw(render)?;
        if matches!(event::read()?, Event::Key(_)) {
            break Ok(());
        }
    }
}

fn render(frame: &amp;mut Frame) {
    frame.render_widget(&quot;hello world&quot;, frame.area());
}
```

## Acknowledgements

Ratatui was forked from the [tui-rs] crate in 2023 in order to continue its development. None of
this could be possible without [Florian Dehau] who originally created [tui-rs] which inspired many
Rust TUIs.

Special thanks to [Pavel Fomchenkov] for his work in designing an awesome logo for the Ratatui
project and organization.

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

([egui 的中文翻译文档 / chinese translation](https://github.com/Re-Ch-Love/egui-doc-cn/blob/main/README_zh-hans.md))


## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies:

* [`ab_glyph`](https://crates.io/crates/ab_glyph)
* [`ahash`](https://crates.io/crates/ahash)
* [`bitflags`](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags)
* [`nohash-hasher`](https://crates.io/crates/nohash-hasher)
* [`parking_lot`](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)

Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, …)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

&lt;!-- ![Release status](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg) --&gt;
&lt;!-- [![docs.rs](todo)](todo) --&gt;
![Coverage](docs/coverage.svg)

An official Rust Model Context Protocol SDK implementation with tokio async runtime.

This repository contains the following crates:

- [rmcp](crates/rmcp): The core crate providing the RMCP protocol implementation( If you want to get more information, please visit [rmcp](crates/rmcp/README.md))
- [rmcp-macros](crates/rmcp-macros): A procedural macro crate for generating RMCP tool implementations(If you want to get more information, please visit [rmcp-macros](crates/rmcp-macros/README.md))

## Usage

### Import the crate

```toml
rmcp = { version = &quot;0.2.0&quot;, features = [&quot;server&quot;] }
## or dev channel
rmcp = { git = &quot;https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk&quot;, branch = &quot;main&quot; }
```
### Third Dependencies
Basic dependencies:
- [tokio required](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
- [serde required](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)



### Build a Client
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Start a client&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
use rmcp::{ServiceExt, transport::{TokioChildProcess, ConfigureCommandExt}};
use tokio::process::Command;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = ().serve(TokioChildProcess::new(Command::new(&quot;npx&quot;).configure(|cmd| {
        cmd.arg(&quot;-y&quot;).arg(&quot;@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything&quot;);
    }))?).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

### Build a Server

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Build a transport&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
use tokio::io::{stdin, stdout};
let transport = (stdin(), stdout());
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Build a service&lt;/summary&gt;

You can easily build a service by using [`ServerHandler`](crates/rmcp/src/handler/server.rs) or [`ClientHandler`](crates/rmcp/src/handler/client.rs).

```rust, ignore
let service = common::counter::Counter::new();
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Start the server&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
// this call will finish the initialization process
let server = service.serve(transport).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Interact with the server&lt;/summary&gt;

Once the server is initialized, you can send requests or notifications:

```rust, ignore
// request
let roots = server.list_roots().await?;

// or send notification
server.notify_cancelled(...).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Waiting for service shutdown&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
let quit_reason = server.waiting().await?;
// or cancel it
let quit_reason = server.cancel().await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running a local development environment

Neon can be run on a workstation for small experiments and to test code changes, by
following these instructions.

#### Installing dependencies on Linux
1. Install build dependencies and other applicable packages

* On Ubuntu or Debian, this set of packages should be sufficient to build the code:
```bash
apt install build-essential libtool libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libseccomp-dev \
libssl-dev clang pkg-config libpq-dev cmake postgresql-client protobuf-compiler \
libprotobuf-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl python3-poetry lsof libicu-dev
```
* On Fedora, these packages are needed:
```bash
dnf install flex bison readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel \
  libseccomp-devel perl clang cmake postgresql postgresql-contrib protobuf-compiler \
  protobuf-devel libcurl-devel openssl poetry lsof libicu-devel libpq-devel python3-devel \
  libffi-devel
```
* On Arch based systems, these packages are needed:
```bash
pacman -S base-devel readline zlib libseccomp openssl clang \
postgresql-libs cmake postgresql protobuf curl lsof
```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo &#039;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it&#039;s built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project&#039;s directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry&gt;=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data
# Later that would be responsibility of a package install script
&gt; cargo neon init
Initializing pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;

# start pageserver, safekeeper, and broker for their intercommunication
&gt; cargo neon start
Starting neon broker at 127.0.0.1:50051.
storage_broker started, pid: 2918372
Starting pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;.
pageserver started, pid: 2918386
Starting safekeeper at &#039;127.0.0.1:5454&#039; in &#039;.neon/safekeepers/sk1&#039;.
safekeeper 1 started, pid: 2918437

# create initial tenant and use it as a default for every future neon_local invocation
&gt; cargo neon tenant create --set-default
tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c successfully created on the pageserver
Created an initial timeline &#039;de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9&#039; at Lsn 0/16B5A50 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c
Setting tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c as a default one

# create postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create main

# start postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start main
Starting new endpoint main (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres&#039;

# check list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT  ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME  LSN        STATUS
 main      127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main         0/16B5BA8  running
```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
&gt; cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline &#039;b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601&#039; at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: &#039;main&#039;

# check branches tree
&gt; cargo neon timeline list
(L) main [de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9]
(L) ┗━ @0/16F9A00: migration_check [b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601]

# create postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create migration_check --branch-name migration_check

# start postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start migration_check
Starting new endpoint migration_check (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55434/postgres&#039;

# check the new list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT         ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME      LSN        STATUS
 main             127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main             0/16F9A38  running
 migration_check  127.0.0.1:55434  b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601  migration_check  0/16F9A70  running

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from &#039;main&#039; postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
&gt; psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn&#039;t affect the &#039;main&#039; postgres
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
&gt; cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Local Development Control Plane (`neon_local`))](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it&#039;s best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--features=testing&quot; make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=17 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

&gt;[!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
&gt; It&#039;s a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
&gt; See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

- [sourcetree.md](/docs/sourcetree.md) contains overview of source tree layout.

To view your `rustdoc` documentation in a browser, try running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

See also README files in some source directories, and `rustdoc` style documentation comments.

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon&#039;s very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it&#039;s inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))
