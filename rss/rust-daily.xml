## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we use Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we&#039;ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:

-   We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    -   Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    -   Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
-   We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3, 2024,the last beta release.
-   We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4, 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
-   We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28, 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
-   We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) on June 20, 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and we do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth documentation](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

-   Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
-   See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.88.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/06/26/Rust-1.88.0/).

See the docs for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [docs][book].

If the answer is not there:

-   Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or
-   Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or
-   Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-bug%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug.yml)

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

-   [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
-   [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
-   [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80). Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

A secure, stable and high-performance reverse proxy for NAT traversal, written in Rust

rathole, like [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) and [ngrok](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok), can help to expose the service on the device behind the NAT to the Internet, via a server with a public IP.

## Features

- **High Performance** Much higher throughput can be achieved than frp, and more stable when handling a large volume of connections. See [Benchmark](#benchmark)
- **Low Resource Consumption** Consumes much fewer memory than similar tools. See [Benchmark](#benchmark). [The binary can be](docs/build-guide.md) **as small as ~500KiB** to fit the constraints of devices, like embedded devices as routers.
- **Security** Tokens of services are mandatory and service-wise. The server and clients are responsible for their own configs. With the optional Noise Protocol, encryption can be configured at ease. No need to create a self-signed certificate! TLS is also supported.
- **Hot Reload** Services can be added or removed dynamically by hot-reloading the configuration file. HTTP API is WIP.

## Quickstart

A full-powered `rathole` can be obtained from the [release](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/releases) page. Or [build from source](docs/build-guide.md) **for other platforms and minimizing the binary**. A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapiz1/rathole) is also available.

The usage of `rathole` is very similar to frp. If you have experience with the latter, then the configuration is very easy for you. The only difference is that configuration of a service is split into the client side and the server side, and a token is mandatory.

To use `rathole`, you need a server with a public IP, and a device behind the NAT, where some services that need to be exposed to the Internet.

Assuming you have a NAS at home behind the NAT, and want to expose its ssh service to the Internet:

1. On the server which has a public IP

Create `server.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# server.toml
[server]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:2333&quot; # `2333` specifies the port that rathole listens for clients

[server.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Token that is used to authenticate the client for the service. Change to an arbitrary value.
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:5202&quot; # `5202` specifies the port that exposes `my_nas_ssh` to the Internet
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole server.toml
```

2. On the host which is behind the NAT (your NAS)

Create `client.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# client.toml
[client]
remote_addr = &quot;myserver.com:2333&quot; # The address of the server. The port must be the same with the port in `server.bind_addr`

[client.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Must be the same with the server to pass the validation
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:22&quot; # The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole client.toml
```

3. Now the client will try to connect to the server `myserver.com` on port `2333`, and any traffic to `myserver.com:5202` will be forwarded to the client&#039;s port `22`.

So you can `ssh myserver.com:5202` to ssh to your NAS.

To run `rathole` run as a background service on Linux, checkout the [systemd examples](./examples/systemd).

## Configuration

`rathole` can automatically determine to run in the server mode or the client mode, according to the content of the configuration file, if only one of `[server]` and `[client]` block is present, like the example in [Quickstart](#quickstart).

But the `[client]` and `[server]` block can also be put in one file. Then on the server side, run `rathole --server config.toml` and on the client side, run `rathole --client config.toml` to explicitly tell `rathole` the running mode.

Before heading to the full configuration specification, it&#039;s recommend to skim [the configuration examples](./examples) to get a feeling of the configuration format.

See [Transport](./docs/transport.md) for more details about encryption and the `transport` block.

Here is the full configuration specification:

```toml

nodelay = true # Optional. Same as the client

[server.services.service2]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.1:8082&quot;
```

### Logging

`rathole`, like many other Rust programs, use environment variables to control the logging level. `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, `trace` are available.

```shell
RUST_LOG=error ./rathole config.toml
```

will run `rathole` with only error level logging.

If `RUST_LOG` is not present, the default logging level is `info`.

### Tuning

From v0.4.7, rathole enables TCP_NODELAY by default, which should benefit the latency and interactive applications like rdp, Minecraft servers. However, it slightly decreases the bandwidth.

If the bandwidth is more important, TCP_NODELAY can be opted out with `nodelay = false`.

## Benchmark

rathole has similar latency to [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), but can handle a more connections, provide larger bandwidth, with less memory usage.

For more details, see the separate page [Benchmark](./docs/benchmark.md).

**However, don&#039;t take it from here that `rathole` can magically make your forwarded service faster several times than before.** The benchmark is done on local loopback, indicating the performance when the task is cpu-bounded. One can gain quite a improvement if the network is not the bottleneck. Unfortunately, that&#039;s not true for many users. In that case, the main benefit is lower resource consumption, while the bandwidth and the latency may not improved significantly.

## Introduction

visioncortex VTracer is an open source software to convert raster images (like jpg &amp; png) into vector graphics (svg). It can vectorize graphics and photographs and trace the curves to output compact vector files.

Comparing to [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/) which only accept binarized inputs (Black &amp; White pixmap), VTracer has an image processing pipeline which can handle colored high resolution scans. tl;dr: Potrace uses a `O(n^2)` fitting algorithm, whereas `vtracer` is entirely `O(n)`.

Comparing to Adobe Illustrator&#039;s [Image Trace](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/image-trace.html), VTracer&#039;s output is much more compact (less shapes) as we adopt a stacking strategy and avoid producing shapes with holes.

VTracer is originally designed for processing high resolution scans of historic blueprints up to gigapixels. At the same time, VTracer can also handle low resolution pixel art, simulating `image-rendering: pixelated` for retro game artworks.

Technical descriptions of the [tracing algorithm](https://www.visioncortex.org/vtracer-docs) and [clustering algorithm](https://www.visioncortex.org/impression-docs).

## Web App

VTracer and its [core library](//github.com/visioncortex/visioncortex) is implemented in [Rust](//www.rust-lang.org/). It provides us a solid foundation to develop robust and efficient algorithms and easily bring it to interactive applications. The webapp is a perfect showcase of the capability of the Rust + wasm platform.

## How did VTracer come about?

&gt; The following content is an excerpt from my [unpublished memoir](https://github.com/visioncortex/memoir).

At my teenage, two open source projects in the vector graphics space inspired me the most: Potrace and Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG).

Many years later, in 2020, I was developing a video processing engine. And it became evident that it requires way more investment to be commercially viable. So before abandoning the project, I wanted to publish *something* as open-source for posterity. At that time, I already developed a prototype vector graphics tracer. It can convert high-resolution scans of hand-drawn blueprints into vectors. But it can only process black and white images, and can only output polygons, not splines.

The plan was to fully develop the vectorizer: to handle color images and output splines. I recruited a very talented intern, [@shpun817](https://github.com/shpun817), to work on VTracer. I grafted the frontend of the video processing engine - the [&quot;The Clustering Algorithm&quot;](https://www.visioncortex.org/impression-docs#the-clustering-algorithm) as the pre-processor.

Three months later, we published the first version on Reddit. Out of my surprise, the response of such an underwhelming project was overwhelming.

## What&#039;s next?

There are several things in my mind:

1. Path simplification. Implement a post-process filter to the output paths to further reduce the number of splines.

2. Perfect cut-out mode. Right now in cut-out mode, the shapes do not share boundaries perfectly, but have seams.

3. Pencil tracing. Instead of tracing shapes as closed paths, may be we can attempt to skeletonize the shapes as open paths. The output would be clean, fixed width strokes.

4. Image cleaning. Right now the tracer works best on losslessly compressed pngs. If an image suffered from jpeg noises, it could impact the tracing quality. We might be able to develop a pre-filtering pass that denoises the input.

If you are interested in working on them or willing to sponsor its development, feel free to get in touch.

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

## BAML: Basically a Made-up Language
&lt;h4&gt;

[Homepage](https://www.boundaryml.com/) | [Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com) | [BAML AI Chat](https://www.boundaryml.com/chat) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/BTNBeXGuaS)



&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

BAML is a simple prompting language for building reliable **AI workflows and agents**.

BAML makes prompt engineering easy by turning it into _schema engineering_ -- where you mostly focus on the models of your prompt -- to get more reliable outputs. 
You don&#039;t need to write your whole app in BAML, only the prompts! You can wire-up your LLM Functions in any language of your choice! See our quickstarts for [Python](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/python), [TypeScript](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/typescript), [Ruby](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/ruby) and [Go, and more](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/rest-api-other-languages).

BAML comes with all batteries included -- with full typesafety, streaming, retries, wide model support, even when they don&#039;t support native [tool-calling APIs](#enable-reliable-tool-calling-with-any-model-even-when-they-dont-support-it)

**Try BAML**: [Prompt Fiddle](https://www.promptfiddle.com) • [Interactive App Examples](https://baml-examples.vercel.app/)


## The core BAML principle: LLM Prompts are functions

The fundamental building block in BAML is a function. Every prompt is a function that takes in parameters and returns a type.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; string
```

Every function additionally defines which models it uses and what its prompt is.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; StopTool | ReplyTool {
    client &quot;openai/gpt-4o-mini&quot;

    prompt #&quot;
        Be a {{ tone }} bot.

        {{ ctx.output_format }}

        {% for m in message %}
        {{ _.role(m.role) }}
        {{ m.content }}
        {% endfor %}
    &quot;#
}

class Message {
    role string
    content string
}

class ReplyTool {
  response string
}

class StopTool {
  action &quot;stop&quot; @description(#&quot;
    when it might be a good time to end the conversation
  &quot;#)
}
```

## BAML Functions can be called from any language
Below we call the ChatAgent function we defined in BAML through Python. BAML&#039;s Rust compiler generates a &quot;baml_client&quot; to access and call them.

```python
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import Message, StopTool

messages = [Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=&quot;How can I help?&quot;)]

while True:
  print(messages[-1].content)
  user_reply = input()
  messages.append(Message(role=&quot;user&quot;, content=user_reply))
  tool = b.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
  if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
    print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
    break
  else:
    messages.append(Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=tool.response))
```
You can write any kind of agent or workflow using chained BAML functions. An agent is a while loop that calls a Chat BAML Function with some state.

And if you need to stream, add a couple more lines:
```python
stream = b.stream.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
# partial is a Partial type with all Optional fields
for tool in stream:
    if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
      ...
    
final = stream.get_final_response()
```
And get fully type-safe outputs for each chunk in the stream.

## Test prompts 10x faster, right in your IDE
BAML comes with native tooling for VSCode (jetbrains + neovim coming soon). 

**Visualize full prompt (including any multi-modal assets), and the API request**. BAML gives you full transparency and control of the prompt.

![raw-curl](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b34db9-80cd-45a7-a356-6b5ab4a9c5b7)

**Using AI is all about iteration speed.**

If testing your pipeline takes 2 minutes, you can only test 10 ideas in 20 minutes.

If you reduce it to 5 seconds, you can test 240 ideas in the same amount of time.
![resume-attempt2-smaller2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc6b8a6-ffed-4cfc-80b8-78bc8a3d66a6)

The playground also allows you to run tests in parallel -- for even faster iteration speeds 🚀.

No need to login to websites, and no need to manually define json schemas.

## Enable reliable tool-calling with any model
BAML works even when the models don&#039;t support native tool-calling APIs. We created the SAP (schema-aligned parsing) algorithm to support the flexible outputs LLMs can provide, like markdown within a JSON blob or chain-of-thought prior to answering. [Read more about SAP](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsing)

With BAML, your structured outputs work in Day-1 of a model release. No need to figure out whether a model supports parallel tool calls, or whether it supports recursive schemas, or `anyOf` or `oneOf` etc.

See it in action with: **[Deepseek-R1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/deepseek-r1-function-calling)** and [OpenAI O1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/openai-o1).

## Build beautiful streaming UIs
BAML generates a ton of utilities for NextJS, Python (and any language) to make streaming UIs easy.
![recipe-generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf82495b-21fc-40bf-ae98-93eef923d620)

BAML&#039;s streaming interfaces are fully type-safe. Check out the [Streaming Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/baml-basics/streaming), and our [React hooks](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/framework-integration/react-next-js/quick-start)

## Fully Open-Source, and offline
- 100% open-source (Apache 2)
- 100% private. AGI will not require an internet connection, neither will BAML
    - No network requests beyond model calls you explicitly set
    - Not stored or used for any training data
- BAML files can be saved locally on your machine and checked into Github for easy diffs.
- Built in Rust. So fast, you can&#039;t even tell it&#039;s there.

## BAML&#039;s Design Philosophy

Everything is fair game when making new syntax. If you can code it, it can be yours. This is our design philosophy to help restrict ideas:

- **1:** Avoid invention when possible
    - Yes, prompts need versioning — we have a great versioning tool: git
    - Yes, you need to save prompts — we have a great storage tool: filesystems
- **2:** Any file editor and any terminal should be enough to use it
- **3:** Be fast
- **4:** A first year university student should be able to understand it

## Why a new programming language

We used to write websites like this:

```python
def home():
    return &quot;&lt;button onclick=\&quot;() =&gt; alert(\\\&quot;hello!\\\&quot;)\&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;&quot;
```

And now we do this:

```jsx
function Home() {
  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prev =&gt; prev + 1)}&gt;
          {count} clicks!
         &lt;/button&gt;
}
```

New syntax can be incredible at expressing new ideas. Plus the idea of maintaining hundreds of f-strings for prompts kind of disgusts us 🤮. Strings are bad for maintainable codebases. We prefer structured strings.

The goal of BAML is to give you the expressiveness of English, but the structure of code.

Full [blog post](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/ai-agents-need-new-syntax) by us.


## Conclusion

As models get better, we&#039;ll continue expecting even more out of them. But what will never change is that we&#039;ll want a way to write maintainable code that uses those models. The current way we all just assemble strings is very reminiscent of the early days PHP/HTML soup in web development. We hope some of the ideas we shared today can make a tiny dent in helping us all shape the way we all code tomorrow.

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## Latest News

* [08/05] Deploy `openai/gpt-oss-120b` with disaggregated serving on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs using Dynamo [➡️ link](./components/backends/trtllm/gpt-oss.md)

## The Era of Multi-GPU, Multi-Node

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models are quickly outgrowing the memory and compute budget of any single GPU. Tensor-parallelism solves the capacity problem by spreading each layer across many GPUs—and sometimes many servers—but it creates a new one: how do you coordinate those shards, route requests, and share KV cache fast enough to feel like one accelerator? This orchestration gap is exactly what NVIDIA Dynamo is built to close.

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:

- **Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference** – Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.
- **Dynamic GPU scheduling** – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-aware request routing** – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated data transfer** – Reduces inference response time using NIXL.
- **KV cache offloading** – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

- **[TensorRT-LLM](components/backends/trtllm/README.md)**

Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.

# Installation

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/support_matrix.md](docs/support_matrix.md)

## 1. Initial setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install etcd and NATS (required)

To coordinate across a data center, Dynamo relies on etcd and NATS. To run Dynamo locally, these need to be available.

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs jetstream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup etcd &amp; NATS, you can also run:
```
# At the root of the repository:
# Edit deploy/docker-compose.yml to comment out &quot;runtime: nvidia&quot; of the dcgm-exporter service if the nvidia container runtime isn&#039;t deployed or to be used.
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 2. Select an engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, trtllm, and llama.cpp. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Running an LLM API server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server, a pre-processor (prompt templating and tokenization) and a router.
# Pass the TLS certificate and key paths to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
python -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 [--tls-cert-path cert.pem] [--tls-key-path key.pem]

# Start the SGLang engine, connecting to NATS and etcd to receive requests. You can run several of these,
# both for the same model and for multiple models. The frontend node will discover them.
python -m dynamo.sglang.worker --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B --skip-tokenizer-init
```

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### Deploying Dynamo

- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](docs/kubernetes/README.md) to deploy on Kubernetes.
- Check out [Backends](components/backends) to deploy various workflow configurations (e.g. SGLang with router, vLLM with disaggregated serving, etc.)
- Run some [Examples](examples) to learn about building components in Dynamo and exploring various integrations.

### Benchmarking Dynamo

Dynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools to evaluate and optimize your deployments:

* **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** – Compare deployment topologies (aggregated vs. disaggregated vs. vanilla vLLM) using GenAI-Perf
* **[Pre-Deployment Profiling](docs/benchmarks/pre_deployment_profiling.md)** – Optimize configurations before deployment to meet SLA requirements

# Engines

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic. To use any engine with Dynamo, NATS and etcd need to be installed, along with a Dynamo frontend (`python -m dynamo.frontend [--interactive]`).

## vLLM

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

vLLM attempts to allocate enough KV cache for the full context length at startup. If that does not fit in your available memory pass `--context-length &lt;value&gt;`.

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

## SGLang

```
# Install libnuma
apt install -y libnuma-dev

uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.sglang.worker --help
```

You can pass any sglang flags directly to this worker, see https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/server_arguments.html . See there to use multiple GPUs.

## TensorRT-LLM

It is recommended to use [NGC PyTorch Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for running the TensorRT-LLM engine.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Ensure that you select a PyTorch container image version that matches the version of TensorRT-LLM you are using.
&gt; For example, if you are using `tensorrt-llm==1.1.0rc5`, use the PyTorch container image version `25.06`.
&gt; To find the correct PyTorch container version for your desired `tensorrt-llm` release, visit the [TensorRT-LLM Dockerfile.multi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.multi) on GitHub. Switch to the branch that matches your `tensorrt-llm` version, and look for the `BASE_TAG` line to identify the recommended PyTorch container tag.

&gt; [!Important]
&gt; Launch container with the following additional settings `--shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1`

### Install prerequisites
```
# Optional step: Only required for Blackwell and Grace Hopper
uv pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Required until the trtllm version is bumped to include this pinned dependency itself
uv pip install &quot;cuda-python&gt;=12,&lt;13&quot;

sudo apt-get -y install libopenmpi-dev
```

&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; You can learn more about these prequisites and known issues with TensorRT-LLM pip based installation [here](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html).

### After installing the pre-requisites above, install Dynamo
```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[trtllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.trtllm --help
```

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

# Developing Locally

## 1. Install libraries

**Ubuntu:**
```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
```
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```
If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.


## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python virtual env:

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don&#039;t have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment
```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install build tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install the wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install .
# For development, use
export PYTHONPATH=&quot;${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/components/frontend/src:$(pwd)/components/planner/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/vllm/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/sglang/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/trtllm/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/llama_cpp/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/mocker/src&quot;
```

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Editable (`-e`) does not work because the `dynamo` package is split over multiple directories, one per backend.

You should now be able to run `python -m dynamo.frontend`.

Remember that nats and etcd must be running (see earlier).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ˈdiːnoʊ/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Wild linker

Wild is a linker with the goal of being very fast for iterative development.

The plan is to eventually make it incremental, however that isn&#039;t yet implemented. It is however
already pretty fast even without incremental linking.

## Installation

### From GitHub releases

Download a tarball from the [releases page](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild/releases). Unpack
it and copy the `wild` binary somewhere on your path.

### Cargo binstall

If you have [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall), you can install wild as
follows:

```sh
cargo binstall wild-linker
```

### Build latest release from crates.io

```sh
cargo install --locked wild-linker
```

### Build from git head

To build and install the latest, unreleased code:

```sh
cargo install --locked --bin wild --git https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild.git wild-linker
```

### Nix

Wild include a flake, a derivation for building Wild, and a stdenv adapter
in-tree. If the overlay is applied these are provided for you. Just add it to
your flake inputs. A devShell example is also shown with the flake.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:NixOS/nix/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    wild = {
      url = &quot;github:davidlattimore/wild&quot;;
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = &quot;nixpkgs&quot;;
    };
  };

  outputs =
    {
      self,
      nixpkgs,
      wild,
    }:
    let
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
        overlays = [
          (import wild)
        ];
      };

      wildStdenv = pkgs.useWildLinker pkgs.stdenv;
    in
    {
      packages.x86_64-linux.default = pkgs.callPackage ./package.nix { stdenv = wildStdenv; };

      devShell.x86_64-linux.default = pkgs.mkShell.override { stdenv = wildStdenv; } {
        inputsFrom = [ self.packages.x86_64-linux.default ];
        packages = [
          pkgs.rust-analyzer
        ];
      };
    };
}
```
Without flakes (npins shown):

1. `$ npins add github davidlattimore wild -b main`

```nix
let
  sources = import ./npins;
  pkgs = import sources.nixpkgs {
    overlays = [
      (import sources.wild)
    ];
  };
  wildStdenv = pkgs.useWildLinker pkgs.stdenv;
in
{
  package = pkgs.callPackage ./package.nix { stdenv = wildStdenv; };
}
```

## Using as your default linker

If you&#039;d like to use Wild as your default linker for building Rust code, you can put the following
in `~/.cargo/config.toml`.

```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = &quot;clang&quot;
rustflags = [&quot;-C&quot;, &quot;link-arg=--ld-path=wild&quot;]
```

## Q&amp;A

### Why another linker?

Mold is already very fast, however it doesn&#039;t do incremental linking and the author has stated that
they don&#039;t intend to. Wild doesn&#039;t do incremental linking yet, but that is the end-goal. By writing
Wild in Rust, it&#039;s hoped that the complexity of incremental linking will be achievable.

### What&#039;s working?

The following platforms / architectures are currently supported:

* x86-64 on Linux
* ARM64 on Linux
* RISC-V (riscv64gc) on Linux (initial support: [#678](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild/issues/678))

The following is working with the caveat that there may be bugs:

* Output to statically linked, non-relocatable binaries
* Output to statically linked, position-independent binaries (static-PIE)
* Output to dynamically linked binaries
* Output to shared objects (.so files)
* Rust proc-macros, when linked with Wild work
* Most of the top downloaded crates on crates.io have been tested with Wild and pass their tests
* Debug info

### What isn&#039;t yet supported?

Lots of stuff. Here are some of the larger things that aren&#039;t yet done, roughly sorted by current
priority:

* Incremental linking
* Support for more architectures
* Support for a wider range of linker flags
* Linker scripts
* Mac support
* Windows support
* LTO

### How can I verify that Wild was used to link a binary?

Install `readelf`, then run:

```sh
readelf  -p .comment my-executable
```

Look for a line like:

```
Linker: Wild version 0.1.0
```

Or if you don&#039;t want to install readelf, you can probably get away with:

```sh
strings my-executable | grep &#039;Linker:&#039;
```

### Where did the name come from?

It&#039;s somewhat of a tradition for linkers to end with the letters &quot;ld&quot;. e.g. &quot;GNU ld, &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;lld&quot;,
&quot;mold&quot;. Since the end-goal is for the linker to be incremental, an &quot;I&quot; is added. Let&#039;s say the &quot;W&quot;
stands for &quot;Wild&quot;, since recursive acronyms are popular in open-source projects.

## Benchmarks

The goal of Wild is to eventually be very fast via incremental linking. However, we also want to be
as fast as we can be for non-incremental linking and for the initial link when incremental linking
is enabled.

See [BENCHMARKING.md](BENCHMARKING.md) for more details on running benchmarks.

All benchmarks are run with output to a tmpfs.

### Linking clang on x86-64

This benchmark was run on David Lattimore&#039;s laptop (2020 model System76 Lemur pro), which has 4
cores (8 threads) and 42 GB of RAM.

Wild currently doesn&#039;t perform great beyond 8 threads. This is something we&#039;ve been investigating
and hope to improve soon.

Summary
  &#039;wild-0.4.0&#039; ran
    1.11 ± 0.02 times faster than &#039;wild-0.4.0-no-fork&#039;
    1.66 ± 0.05 times faster than &#039;mold-2.36&#039;
    1.76 ± 0.04 times faster than &#039;mold-2.36-no-fork&#039;
    2.33 ± 0.04 times faster than &#039;lld-18&#039;
Throttle pkg: 0 core: 0 ms: 0 temp: +59.0°C
```

Note, the user and system CPU times for mold and wild when run with default flags are meaningless,
since these linkers fork by default and hyperfine doesn&#039;t see the CPU usage of the forked
subprocess. For accurate CPU usage, see the no-fork variants. For later benchmarks, we always
include `--no-fork` for these linkers. This makes each of these linkers slower by about 10%.

GNU ld is excluded from the benchmarks because its speed is so totally different to the other
linkers that it makes it hard to compare. But for reference, here is the time for GNU ld for this
benchmark:

```
Benchmark 1: GNU-ld-2.38

Throttle pkg: 18454 core: 5916 ms: 328 temp: +77.0°C
```

Note, despite setting my fans to maximum before the start of the benchmark, I did get some thermal
throttling in this run. However, the standard deviations look pretty tight, so I don&#039;t think it
really invalidated the results.

The big takeaway from this benchmark is that debug info can make your link times really slow, so if
you don&#039;t need it, turn it off. If you do need it, try to use split debug info or unpacked debug
info. The situation with debug info is especially bad for C++ codebases like clang, probably due to
header files causing lots of the same information to be repeated.

## Linking Rust code

The following is a `cargo test` command-line that can be used to build and test a crate using Wild.
This has been run successfully on a few popular crates (e.g. ripgrep, serde, tokio, rand, bitflags).
It assumes that the &quot;wild&quot; binary is on your path. It also depends on the Clang compiler being
installed, since GCC doesn&#039;t allow using an arbitrary linker.

```sh
RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-Clinker=clang -Clink-args=--ld-path=wild&quot; cargo test
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Embassy

Embassy is the next-generation framework for embedded applications. Write safe, correct, and energy-efficient embedded code faster, using the Rust programming language, its async facilities, and the Embassy libraries.

## [Documentation](https://embassy.dev/book/index.html) - [API reference](https://docs.embassy.dev/) - [Website](https://embassy.dev/) - [Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#embassy-rs:matrix.org)

## Rust + async ❤️ embedded

The Rust programming language is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime, garbage collector, or OS. It catches a wide variety of bugs at compile time, thanks to its full memory- and thread-safety, and expressive type system.

Rust&#039;s [async/await](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/) allows for unprecedentedly easy and efficient multitasking in embedded systems. Tasks get transformed at compile time into state machines that get run cooperatively. It requires no dynamic memory allocation and runs on a single stack, so no per-task stack size tuning is required. It obsoletes the need for a traditional RTOS with kernel context switching, and is [faster and smaller than one!](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown)

## Batteries included

- **Hardware Abstraction Layers**
    - HALs implement safe, idiomatic Rust APIs to use the hardware capabilities, so raw register manipulation is not needed. The Embassy project maintains HALs for select hardware, but you can still use HALs from other projects with Embassy.
    - [embassy-stm32](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/), for all STM32 microcontroller families.
    - [embassy-nrf](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-nrf/), for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF54 and nRF91 series.
    - [embassy-rp](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/), for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP23xx microcontrollers.
    - [embassy-mspm0](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-mspm0/), for the Texas Instruments MSPM0 microcontrollers.
    - [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs), for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of chips.
        - Embassy HAL support for Espressif chips, as well as Async Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ESP-NOW, is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repository.
    - [ch32-hal](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal), for the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series of chips.
    - [mpfs-hal](https://github.com/AlexCharlton/mpfs-hal), for the Microchip PolarFire SoC.
    - [py32-hal](https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-hal), for the Puya Semiconductor PY32 series of microcontrollers.

- **Time that Just Works** -
  No more messing with hardware timers. [embassy_time](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time) provides Instant, Duration, and Timer types that are globally available and never overflow.

- **Real-time ready** -
  Tasks on the same async executor run cooperatively, but you can create multiple executors with different priorities so that higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones. See the [example](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/master/examples/nrf52840/src/bin/multiprio.rs).

- **Low-power ready** -
  Easily build devices with years of battery life. The async executor automatically puts the core to sleep when there&#039;s no work to do. Tasks are woken by interrupts, there is no busy-loop polling while waiting.

- **Networking** -
  The [embassy-net](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/) network stack implements extensive networking functionality, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and DHCP. Async drastically simplifies managing timeouts and serving multiple connections concurrently.

- **Bluetooth**
    - The [trouble](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble) crate provides a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x Host that runs on any microcontroller implementing the [bt-hci](https://github.com/embassy-rs/bt-hci) traits (currently
      `nRF52`, `rp2040`, `rp23xx` and `esp32` and `serial` controllers are supported).
    - The [nrf-softdevice](https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice) crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x support for nRF52 microcontrollers.
    - The [embassy-stm32-wpan](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-stm32-wpan) crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 5.x support for stm32wb microcontrollers.

- **LoRa** -
  The [lora-rs](https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs) project provides an async LoRa and LoRaWAN stack that works well on Embassy.

- **USB** -
  [embassy-usb](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-usb/) implements a device-side USB stack. Implementations for common classes such as USB serial (CDC ACM) and USB HID are available, and a rich builder API allows building your own.

- **Bootloader and DFU** -
  [embassy-boot](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/master/embassy-boot) is a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks.

## Examples

Examples are found in the
`examples/` folder separated by the chip manufacturer they are designed to run on. For example:

* `examples/nrf52840` run on the
  `nrf52840-dk` board (PCA10056) but should be easily adaptable to other nRF52 chips and boards.
* `examples/nrf5340` run on the `nrf5340-dk` board (PCA10095).
* `examples/stm32xx` for the various STM32 families.
* `examples/rp` are for the RP2040 chip.
* `examples/std` are designed to run locally on your PC.

### Running examples

- Install `probe-rs` following the instructions at &lt;https://probe.rs&gt;.
- Change directory to the sample&#039;s base directory. For example:

```bash
cd examples/nrf52840
```

- Ensure `Cargo.toml` sets the right feature for the name of the chip you are programming.
  If this name is incorrect, the example may fail to run or immediately crash
  after being programmed.

- Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` contains the name of the chip you are programming.

- Run the example

For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin blinky
```

## Developing Embassy with Rust Analyzer-based editors

The [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is used by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and others. Given the multiple targets that Embassy serves, there is no Cargo workspace file. Instead, the Rust Analyzer
must be told of the target project to work with. In the case of Visual Studio Code,
please refer to the `.vscode/settings.json` file&#039;s `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects`setting.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

Embassy is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.75 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions, but that may change in any new patch release.

## Why the name?

EMBedded ASYnc! :)

## License

Embassy is licensed under either of

- Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or
  &lt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&gt;)
- MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;)

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

## React Template（⚡️）

⚡️ A minimal React Vite starter template.

### Feature

- ⚡️ Fast - Build tools based on vite.
- 👻 Small - Based on the smallest runnable build.

## Installation

The Wasmtime CLI can be installed on Linux and macOS (locally) with a small install
script:

```console
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```
This script installs into `$WASMTIME_HOME` (defaults to `$HOME/.wasmtime`), and executable is placed in `$WASMTIME_HOME/bin`.

After running the install script above, follow the on-screen instructions.

Windows or otherwise interested users can download installers and
binaries directly from the [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) page.

For additional installation options, refer to the [online book CLI installation page](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/cli-install.html).

Documentation on Wasmtime&#039;s currently supported versions can be found [in the
online book
documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html#current-versions).

## Example

If you&#039;ve got the [Rust compiler
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then you can take some Rust
source code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
```

and compile it into a WebAssembly component with:

```console
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
rustc hello.rs --target wasm32-wasip2
```

Once compiled, you can run your component:

```console
wasmtime hello.wasm
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Hello, world!
```

(Note: make sure you installed Rust using the [`rustup`][rustup] method in the official
instructions above, and do not have a copy of the Rust toolchain installed on
your system in some other way as well (e.g. the system package manager). Otherwise, the `rustup target add...`
command may not install the target for the correct copy of Rust.)

## Features

* **Fast**. Wasmtime is built on the optimizing [Cranelift] code generator to
  quickly generate high-quality machine code either at runtime or
  ahead-of-time. Wasmtime is optimized for efficient instantiation, low-overhead
  calls between the embedder and wasm, and scalability of concurrent instances.

* **[Secure]**. Wasmtime&#039;s development is strongly focused on correctness and
  security. Building on top of Rust&#039;s runtime safety guarantees, each Wasmtime
  feature goes through careful review and consideration via an [RFC
  process]. Once features are designed and implemented, they undergo 24/7
  fuzzing donated by [Google&#039;s OSS Fuzz]. As features stabilize they become part
  of a [release][release policy], and when things go wrong we have a
  well-defined [security policy] in place to quickly mitigate and patch any
  issues. We follow best practices for defense-in-depth and integrate
  protections and mitigations for issues like Spectre. Finally, we&#039;re working to
  push the state-of-the-art by collaborating with academic researchers to
  formally verify critical parts of Wasmtime and Cranelift.

* **[Configurable]**. Wasmtime uses sensible defaults, but can also be
  configured to provide more fine-grained control over things like CPU and
  memory consumption. Whether you want to run Wasmtime in a tiny environment or
  on massive servers with many concurrent instances, we&#039;ve got you covered.

* **[WASI]**. Wasmtime supports a rich set of APIs for interacting with the host
  environment through the [WASI standard](https://wasi.dev).

* **[Standards Compliant]**. Wasmtime passes the [official WebAssembly test
  suite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite), implements the [official C
  API of wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), and implements
  [future proposals to WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) as
  well. Wasmtime developers are intimately engaged with the WebAssembly
  standards process all along the way too.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the above snippet into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

Difftastic is a structural diff tool that compares files based on
their syntax.

**For installation instructions, see
[Installation](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/installation.html) in
[the manual](http://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/).**

## Basic Example

![Screenshot of difftastic and JS](img/js.png)

In this JavaScript example, we can see:

(1) Difftastic understands nesting. It highlights the matching `{` and
`}`, but understands that `foo()` hasn&#039;t changed despite the leading
whitespace.

(2) Difftastic understands which lines should be aligned. It&#039;s aligned
`bar(1)` on the left with `bar(2)` on the right, even though the
textual content isn&#039;t identical.

(3) Difftastic understands that line-wrapping isn&#039;t
meaningful. `&quot;eric&quot;` is now on a new line, but it hasn&#039;t changed.

## One Minute Demo

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/480875.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/480875)

This one minute screencast demonstrates difftastic usage with both
standalone files and git.

## Languages

Difftastic supports over 30 programming languages, see [the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/languages_supported.html) for the full list.

If a file has an unrecognised extension, difftastic uses a
textual diff with word highlighting.

## Known Issues

Performance. Difftastic scales relatively poorly on files with a large
number of changes, and can use a lot of memory.

Display. Difftastic has a side-by-side display which usually works well, but can
be confusing.

Robustness. Difftastic regularly has releases that fix crashes.

## Non-goals

Patching. Difftastic output is intended for human consumption, and it
does not generate patches that you can apply later. Use `diff` if you
need a patch.

(Patch files are also line-oriented, which is too limited for
difftastic. Difftastic might find additions and removals on the same
line, and it tracks the relationship between line numbers in the old
and new file.)

Merging. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not
address. You might be interested in the [mergiraf
tool](https://mergiraf.org/) (&quot;merge giraffe&quot;), which does do AST
merging.

## FAQ

### Isn&#039;t this basically `--word-diff --ignore-all-space`?

Word diffing [can&#039;t do
this](https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/1510139929971421191/photo/1).

Difftastic parses your code. It understands when whitespace matters,
such as inside string literals or languages like Python. It understands
that `x-1` is three tokens in JS but one token in Lisp.

### Can I use difftastic with git?

You can! The difftastic manual [includes instructions for git
usage](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html). You can also use it
[with mercurial](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/mercurial.html).

If you&#039;re an Emacs user, check out [this blog
post](https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html)
showing one way to use difftastic with magit, as well as
[difftastic.el](https://github.com/pkryger/difftastic.el).

### Does difftastic integrate with my favourite tool?

Probably not. Difftastic is young. Consider writing a plugin for your
favourite tool, and I will link it in the README!

### What about parse errors?

By default, difftastic falls back to a line-oriented diff whenever
parse errors are encountered.

This is a conservative choice to ensure that difftastic never claims
two syntactically different files are the same.

Parse errors can occur if the file uses language features that the
parser does not understand, if the language relies on a preprocessor
before parsing (e.g. C++), or if the file has genuine syntactic
mistakes.

In practice, difftastic virtually always produces a good result when
there are a few minor parse errors. Consider allowing a small number
of parse errors when using difftastic.

```
$ export DFT_PARSE_ERROR_LIMIT=20
$ difft foo1.c foo2.c
```

### Can difftastic help me with merge conflicts?

Yes! As of version 0.50, difftastic understands merge conflict markers
(i.e. `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;`, `=======` and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`).

Pass your file with conflicts as a single argument to
difftastic. Difftastic will construct the two conflicting files and
diff those.

```
$ difft file_with_conflicts.js
```

### Can difftastic do merges?

No. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not address.

AST diffing is a lossy process from the perspective of a text
diff. Difftastic will ignore whitespace that isn&#039;t syntactically
significant, but merging requires tracking whitespace.

The [mergiraf](https://mergiraf.org/) tool does offer merges based on
a tree-sitter AST however.

### Can difftastic ignore reordering?

No. Difftastic always considers order to be important, so diffing
e.g. `set(1, 2)` and `set(2, 1)` will show changes.

If you&#039;re diffing JSON, consider sorting the keys before passing them
to difftastic.

```
$ difft &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_1.json) &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_2.json)
```

See also [Tricky Cases: Unordered Data
Types](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/tricky_cases.html#unordered-data-types)
in the manual.

### Can I use difftastic to check for syntactic changes without diffing?

Yes. Difftastic can check if the two files have the same AST, without
calculating a diff. This is much faster than normal diffing, and
useful for building tools that check for changes.

For example:

```
$ difft --check-only --exit-code before.js after.js
```

This will set the exit code to 0 if there are no syntactic changes, or
1 if there are changes found.

### Why aren&#039;t colours appearing in my terminal?

Difftastic uses ANSI bright colours by default, but some terminal
themes show bright colours as grey. Solarized is a popular theme that
does this.

If you&#039;re a Solarized user, use `export DFT_BACKGROUND=light` to
disable bright colours, or try a different terminal colour scheme.

### How does it work?

Difftastic treats structural diffing as a graph problem, and uses
Dijkstra&#039;s algorithm.

My [blog
post](https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/)
describes the design, and there is also an [internals section in the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/diffing.html).

## Overview

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument,
generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for
analysis in order to understand your software&#039;s performance and behavior. You
can export and analyze them using [Prometheus], [Jaeger], and other
observability tools.

*[Supported Rust Versions](#supported-rust-versions)*

[Prometheus]: https://prometheus.io
[Jaeger]: https://www.jaegertracing.io

## Project Status

The table below summarizes the overall status of each component. Some components
include unstable features, which are documented in their respective crate
documentation.

| Signal/Component      | Overall Status     |
| --------------------  | ------------------ |
| Context               | Beta               |
| Baggage               | RC                 |
| Propagators           | Beta               |

*OpenTelemetry Rust is not introducing a new end user callable Logging API.
Instead, it provides [Logs Bridge
API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/api.md),
that allows one to write log appenders that can bridge existing logging
libraries to the OpenTelemetry log data model. The following log appenders are
available:

* [opentelemetry-appender-log](opentelemetry-appender-log/README.md)
* [opentelemetry-appender-tracing](opentelemetry-appender-tracing/README.md)

If you already use the logging APIs from above, continue to use them, and use
the appenders above to bridge the logs to OpenTelemetry. If you are using a
library not listed here, feel free to contribute a new appender for the same.

If you are starting fresh, we recommend using
[tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) as your logging API. It supports
structured logging and is actively maintained. `OpenTelemetry` itself uses
`tracing` for its internal logging.

Project versioning information and stability guarantees can be found
[here](VERSIONING.md).

## Getting Started

If you are new to OpenTelemetry, start with the [Stdout
Example](./opentelemetry-stdout/examples/basic.rs). This example demonstrates
how to use OpenTelemetry for logs, metrics, and traces, and display
telemetry data on your console.

For those using OTLP, the recommended OpenTelemetry Exporter for production
scenarios, refer to the [OTLP Example -
HTTP](./opentelemetry-otlp/examples/basic-otlp-http/README.md) and the [OTLP
Example - gRPC](./opentelemetry-otlp/examples/basic-otlp/README.md).

Additional examples for various integration patterns can be found in the
[examples](./examples) directory.

## Overview of crates

The following crates are maintained in this repo:

* [`opentelemetry`] This is the OpenTelemetry API crate, and is the crate
  required to instrument libraries and applications. It contains Context API,
  Baggage API, Propagators API, Logging Bridge API, Metrics API, and Tracing
  API.
* [`opentelemetry-sdk`] This is the OpenTelemetry SDK crate, and contains the
  official OpenTelemetry SDK implementation. It contains Logging SDK, Metrics
  SDK, and Tracing SDK. It also contains propagator implementations.
* [`opentelemetry-otlp`] - exporter to send telemetry (logs, metrics and traces)
  in the [OTLP
  format](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/protocol)
  to an endpoint accepting OTLP. This could be the [OTel
  Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector),
  telemetry backends like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/),
  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#otlp-receiver)
  or [vendor specific endpoints](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/).
* [`opentelemetry-stdout`] exporter for sending logs, metrics and traces to
  stdout, for learning/debugging purposes.  
* [`opentelemetry-http`] This crate contains utility functions to help with
  exporting telemetry, propagation, over [`http`].
* [`opentelemetry-appender-log`] This crate provides logging appender to route
  logs emitted using the [log](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/) crate to
  opentelemetry.
* [`opentelemetry-appender-tracing`] This crate provides logging appender to
  route logs emitted using the [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) crate
  to opentelemetry.  
* [`opentelemetry-jaeger-propagator`] provides context propagation using [jaeger
  propagation
  format](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.18/client-libraries/#propagation-format).
* [`opentelemetry-prometheus`] provides a pipeline and exporter for sending
  metrics to [`Prometheus`].
* [`opentelemetry-semantic-conventions`] provides standard names and semantic
  otel conventions.
* [`opentelemetry-zipkin`] provides a pipeline and exporter for sending traces
  to [`Zipkin`].

In addition, there are several other useful crates in the [OTel Rust Contrib
repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust-contrib). A lot of
crates maintained outside OpenTelemetry owned repos can be found in the
[OpenTelemetry
Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?language=rust).

## Supported Rust Versions

OpenTelemetry is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
version is 1.75. The current OpenTelemetry version is not guaranteed to build
on Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions
before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler
version is 1.49, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.46,
three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version
is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies with
this policy.

&lt;/div&gt;

[Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) is a framework providing several convenient developer tools for writing Solana programs (sometimes called &#039;smart contracts&#039;).

- Rust eDSL for writing Solana programs
- [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) specification
- TypeScript package for generating clients from IDL
- CLI and workspace management for developing complete applications

Anchor is the most popular framework for Solana programs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re familiar with developing in Ethereum&#039;s [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), then using Anchor will be familiar. Although the DSL syntax and semantics are targeted at Solana, the high level flow of writing RPC request handlers, emitting an IDL, and generating clients from IDL is the same.

## Getting Started

For a quickstart guide and in depth tutorials, see the [Anchor book](https://book.anchor-lang.com) and the [Anchor documentation](https://anchor-lang.com).

To jump straight to examples, go [here](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/tree/master/examples). For the latest Rust and TypeScript API documentation, see [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang) and the [typedoc](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/clients/typescript).

## Examples

Here&#039;s a counter program, where only the designated `authority`
can increment the count.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!(&quot;Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS&quot;);

#[program]
mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context&lt;Initialize&gt;, start: u64) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.authority = *ctx.accounts.authority.key;
        counter.count = start;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context&lt;Increment&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count += 1;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(init, payer = authority, space = 48)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
    pub system_program: Program&lt;&#039;info, System&gt;,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(mut, has_one = authority)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
}

#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub count: u64,
}
```

Lapce (IPA: /læps/) is written in pure Rust, with a UI in [Floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor), enabling lightning-fast computation, and leverages [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering. More information about the features of Lapce can be found on the [main website](https://lapce.dev) and user documentation can be found on [GitBook](https://docs.lapce.dev/).

![](https://github.com/lapce/lapce/blob/master/extra/images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Features

* Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
* Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Enjoy the benefits of a &quot;local&quot; experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system. We also have [Lapdev](https://lap.dev/) which can help manage your remote dev environments. 
* Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.

&lt;/h3&gt;

## Welcome

xet-core enables huggingface_hub to utilize xet storage for uploading and downloading to HF Hub. Xet storage provides chunk-based deduplication, efficient storage/retrieval with local disk caching, and backwards compatibility with Git LFS. This library is not meant to be used directly, and is instead intended to be used from [huggingface_hub](https://pypi.org/project/huggingface-hub).

## Key features

♻ **chunk-based deduplication implementation**: avoid transferring and storing chunks that are shared across binary files (models, datasets, etc).

🤗 **Python bindings**: bindings for [huggingface_hub](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/) package.

↔ **network communications**: concurrent communication to HF Hub Xet backend services (CAS).

🔖 **local disk caching**: chunk-based cache that sits alongside the existing [huggingface_hub disk cache](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/manage-cache).

## Contributions (feature requests, bugs, etc.) are encouraged &amp; appreciated 💙💚💛💜🧡❤️

Please join us in making xet-core better. We value everyone&#039;s contributions. Code is not the only way to help. Answering questions, helping each other, improving documentation, filing issues all help immensely. If you are interested in contributing (please do!), check out the [contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this repository.

## Issues, Diagnostics &amp; Debugging

If you encounter an issue when using `hf-xet` please help us fix the issue by collecting diagnostic information and attaching that when creating a [new Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core/issues/new/choose). Download the [hf-xet-diag-linux.sh](hf-xet-diag-linux.sh) or [hf-xet-diag-windows.sh](hf-xet-diag-windows.sh) script based on your operating system and then re-run the python command that resulted in the issue. The diagnostic scripts will download and install debug symbols, setup up logging, and take periodic stack traces throughout process execution in a diagnostics directory that is easy to analyze, package, and upload.

### Diagnostics - Linux (`hf-xet-diag-linux.sh`)

* Uses `gdb` + `gcore` to periodically snapshot stacks and produce core dumps.
* Supports optional ptrace preload helper for debugging.
* Downloads and installs the appropriate `hf_xet-*.dbg` symbol file automatically.

**Requirements:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install gdb build-essential
```

**Example usage:**

```bash
./hf-xet-diag-linux.sh -- python hf-download.py &quot;Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct&quot;
```

### Windows (Git-Bash) (`hf-xet-diag-windows.sh`)

* Runs in **Git-Bash**, keeping usage consistent with Linux.
* Uses **Sysinternals ProcDump** for periodic mini dumps (`-mp`).
* Auto-downloads `procdump.exe` if not found.
* Downloads and installs the matching `hf_xet.pdb` debug symbol into the package directory.

**Requirements:**

* Git-Bash (from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/))
* Python installed
* Internet access (first run downloads ProcDump and debug symbols)

**Example usage:**

```bash
./hf-xet-diag-windows.sh -- python hf-download.py &quot;Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct&quot;
```

### Diagnostics - MacOS (`hf-xet-diag-macos.sh`)

* Uses `sample` + `lldb` to periodically snapshot stacks and produce core dumps.
* Downloads and installs the appropriate `hf_xet-*.dbg` symbol file automatically.

**Requirements:**

```bash
sudo xcode-select --install
```

**Example usage:**

```bash
./hf-xet-diag-macos.sh -- python hf-download.py &quot;Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct&quot;
```

---

### Output Layout

Both scripts produce a diagnostics directory named:

```
diag_&lt;command&gt;_&lt;timestamp&gt;/
  ├── console.log   # Combined stdout/stderr of the process
  ├── env.log       # System/environment info
  ├── pid           # Child PID file
  ├── stacks/       # Periodic stack traces / dumps
  └── dumps/        # (Linux only) full gcore dumps
```

This unified layout makes it easier to compare diagnostics across platforms.

---

### Analyzing Dumps

### Usage

From your repo root:

```bash
./analyze-latest.sh
```

* Finds the most recent `diag_*` directory.
* Opens the latest dump inside:

  * **Linux:** opens `dumps/core_*` in `gdb`.
  * **Windows (Git-Bash):** opens `stacks/*.dmp` in **WinDbg** (`windbg` must be on PATH).
* You can also pass a base directory if your diagnostics are stored elsewhere:

  ```bash
  ./analyze-latest.sh /path/to/diagnostics
  ```

**Linux**

* Stack traces are saved under `stacks/` as plain text.
* Core dumps (`dumps/core_*`) can be analyzed with gdb:

  ```bash
  gdb python dumps/core_&lt;pid&gt;
  (gdb) bt        # backtrace
  (gdb) thread apply all bt
  ```
* Ensure the matching debug symbols (`hf_xet-*.dbg`) are in the `hf_xet` package directory.

**Windows**

* Dumps are saved under `stacks/` as `.dmp` files.
* Open `.dmp` files in **WinDbg** (install via [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)):

  ```cmd
  windbg -z dump_20250101_120000.dmp
  ```
* Common WinDbg commands:

  ```
  !analyze -v         # Automatic analysis
  ~* kb               # Show stack traces for all threads
  lm                  # List loaded modules (verify hf_xet.pdb loaded)
  ```
* Ensure `hf_xet.pdb` is installed in the `hf_xet` package directory so symbols load correctly.

---

⚠️ **Tip:** Share the full `diag_&lt;command&gt;_&lt;timestamp&gt;/` directory when reporting issues — it contains logs, environment info, and dumps needed to reproduce and diagnose problems.


### Debugging

To limit the size our our built binaries, we are releasing python wheels with binaries that are stripped of debugging symbols. If you encounter a panic while running hf-xet, you can use the debug symbols to help identify the part of the library that failed. 

Here are the recommended steps:

1. Download and unzip our [debug symbols package](https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core/releases/download/latest/dbg-symbols.zip).
2. Determine the location of the hf-xet package using `pip show hf-xet`. The `Location` field will show the location of all the site packages. The `hf_xet` package will be within that directory.
3. Determine the symbols to copy based on the system you are running:
   * Windows: use `hf_xet.pdb`
   * Mac: use `libhf_xet-macosx-x86_64.dylib.dSYM` for Intel based Macs and `libhf_xet-macosx-aarch64.dylib.dSYM` for Apple Silicon.
   * Linux: the choice will depend on the architecture and wheel distribution used. To get this information, `cat` the `WHEEL` file name within the `hf_xet.dist-info` directory in your site packages. The wheel file will have the linux build and architecture in the file name. Eg: `cat /home/ubuntu/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/hf_xet-*.dist-info/WHEEL`. You will use the file named `hf_xet-&lt;manylinux | musllinux&gt;-&lt;x86_64 | arm64&gt;.abi3.so.dbg` choosing the distribution and platform that matches your wheel. Eg: `hf_xet-manylinux-x86_64.abi3.so.dbg`.
4. Copy the symbols to the site package path from step 2 above + `hf_xet`. Eg: `cp -r hf_xet-1.1.2-manylinux-x86_64.abi3.so.dbg /home/ubuntu/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/hf_xet`
5. Run your python binary with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` and recreate your failure.

#### Debugging Environment Variables

To enable logging and see more debugging / diagnostics information, set the following:

```
RUST_BACKTRACE=full
RUST_LOG=info
HF_XET_LOG_FILE=/tmp/xet.log
```

Note: HF_XET_LOG_FILE expects a full writable path. If one isn&#039;t found it will use stdout console for logging.

## Local Development

### Repo Organization - Rust Crates

* [cas_client](./cas_client): communication with CAS backend services, which include APIs for Xorbs and Shards.
* [cas_object](./cas_object): CAS object (Xorb) format and associated APIs, including chunks (ranges within Xorbs).
* [cas_types](./cas_types): common types shared across crates in xet-core and xetcas.
* [chunk_cache](./chunk_cache): local disk cache of Xorb chunks.
* [chunk_cache_bench](./chunk_cache_bench): benchmarking crate for chunk_cache.
* [data](./data): main driver for client operations - FilePointerTranslator drives hydrating or shrinking files, chunking + deduplication here.
* [error_printer](./error_printer): utility for printing errors conveniently.
* [file_utils](./file_utils): SafeFileCreator utility, used by chunk_cache.
* [hf_xet](./hf_xet): Python integration with Rust code, uses maturin to build `hf-xet` Python package. Main integration with HF Hub Python package.
* [mdb_shard](./mdb_shard): Shard operations, including Shard format, dedupe probing, benchmarks, and utilities.
* [merklehash](./merklehash): MerkleHash type, 256-bit hash, widely used across many crates.
* [progress_reporting](./progress_reporting): offers ReportedWriter so progress for Writer operations can be displayed.
* [utils](./utils): general utilities, including singleflight, progress, serialization_utils and threadpool.

### Build, Test &amp; Benchmark

To build xet-core, look at requirements in [GitHub Actions CI Workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for the Rust toolchain to install. Follow Rust documentation for installing rustup and that version of the toolchain. Use the following steps for building, testing, benchmarking.

Many of us on the team use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), so we have checked in some settings in the .vscode directory. Install the rust-analyzer extension.

Build:

```
cargo build
```

Test:

```
cargo test
```

Benchmark:
```
cargo bench
```

Linting:
```
cargo clippy -r --verbose -- -D warnings
```

Formatting (requires nightly toolchain):
```
cargo +nightly fmt --manifest-path ./Cargo.toml --all
```

### Building Python package and running locally (on *nix systems):

1. Create Python3 virtualenv: `python3 -mvenv ~/venv`
2. Activate virtualenv: `source ~/venv/bin/activate`
3. Install maturin: `pip3 install maturin ipython`
4. Go to hf_xet crate: `cd hf_xet`
5. Build: `maturin develop`
6. Test: 
```
ipython
import hf_xet as hfxet
hfxet.upload_files()
hfxet.download_files()
```

#### Developing with tokio console

&gt; Prerequisite is installing tokio-console (`cargo install tokio-console`). See [https://github.com/tokio-rs/console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console)

To use tokio-console with hf-xet there are compile hf_xet with the following command:
```sh
RUSTFLAGS=&quot;--cfg tokio_unstable&quot; maturin develop -r --features tokio-console
```

Then while hf_xet is running (via a `hf` cli command or `huggingface_hub` python code), `tokio-console` will be able to connect.

### Ex.

```bash
# In one terminal:
pip install huggingface_hub
RUSTFLAGS=&quot;--cfg tokio_unstable&quot; maturin develop -r --features tokio-console
hf download openai/gpt-oss-20b

# In another terminal
cargo install tokio-console
tokio-console
```

#### Building universal whl for MacOS:

From hf_xet directory:
```
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 maturin build --release --target universal2-apple-darwin --features openssl_vendored
```

Note: You may need to install x86_64: `rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin`

### Testing

Unit-tests are run with `cargo test`, benchmarks are run with `cargo bench`. Some crates have a main.rs that can be run for manual testing.
