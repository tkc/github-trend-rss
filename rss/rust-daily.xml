# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running a local development environment

Neon can be run on a workstation for small experiments and to test code changes, by
following these instructions.

#### Installing dependencies on Linux
1. Install build dependencies and other applicable packages

* On Ubuntu or Debian, this set of packages should be sufficient to build the code:
```bash
apt install build-essential libtool libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libseccomp-dev \
libssl-dev clang pkg-config libpq-dev cmake postgresql-client protobuf-compiler \
libprotobuf-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl python3-poetry lsof libicu-dev
```
* On Fedora, these packages are needed:
```bash
dnf install flex bison readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel \
  libseccomp-devel perl clang cmake postgresql postgresql-contrib protobuf-compiler \
  protobuf-devel libcurl-devel openssl poetry lsof libicu-devel libpq-devel python3-devel \
  libffi-devel
```
* On Arch based systems, these packages are needed:
```bash
pacman -S base-devel readline zlib libseccomp openssl clang \
postgresql-libs cmake postgresql protobuf curl lsof
```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo &#039;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it&#039;s built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project&#039;s directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry&gt;=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data
# Later that would be responsibility of a package install script
&gt; cargo neon init
Initializing pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;

# start pageserver, safekeeper, and broker for their intercommunication
&gt; cargo neon start
Starting neon broker at 127.0.0.1:50051.
storage_broker started, pid: 2918372
Starting pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;.
pageserver started, pid: 2918386
Starting safekeeper at &#039;127.0.0.1:5454&#039; in &#039;.neon/safekeepers/sk1&#039;.
safekeeper 1 started, pid: 2918437

# create initial tenant and use it as a default for every future neon_local invocation
&gt; cargo neon tenant create --set-default
tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c successfully created on the pageserver
Created an initial timeline &#039;de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9&#039; at Lsn 0/16B5A50 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c
Setting tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c as a default one

# create postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create main

# start postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start main
Starting new endpoint main (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres&#039;

# check list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT  ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME  LSN        STATUS
 main      127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main         0/16B5BA8  running
```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
&gt; cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline &#039;b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601&#039; at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: &#039;main&#039;

# check branches tree
&gt; cargo neon timeline list
(L) main [de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9]
(L) ┗━ @0/16F9A00: migration_check [b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601]

# create postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create migration_check --branch-name migration_check

# start postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start migration_check
Starting new endpoint migration_check (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55434/postgres&#039;

# check the new list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT         ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME      LSN        STATUS
 main             127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main             0/16F9A38  running
 migration_check  127.0.0.1:55434  b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601  migration_check  0/16F9A70  running

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from &#039;main&#039; postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
&gt; psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn&#039;t affect the &#039;main&#039; postgres
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
&gt; cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Local Development Control Plane (`neon_local`))](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it&#039;s best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--features=testing&quot; make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=17 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

&gt;[!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
&gt; It&#039;s a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
&gt; See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

- [sourcetree.md](/docs/sourcetree.md) contains overview of source tree layout.

To view your `rustdoc` documentation in a browser, try running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

See also README files in some source directories, and `rustdoc` style documentation comments.

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon&#039;s very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it&#039;s inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))

## Features and Roadmap

Limbo is a _work-in-progress_, in-process OLTP database engine library written in Rust that has:

* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **SQLite compatibility** [[doc](COMPAT.md)] for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API
* **Language bindings** for JavaScript/WebAssembly, Rust, Go, Python, and [Java](bindings/java)
* **OS support** for Linux, macOS, and Windows

In the future, we will be also working on:

* **Integrated vector search** for embeddings and vector similarity.
* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput.
* **Improved schema management** including better `ALTER` support and strict column types by default.

## Getting Started

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `limbo` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/releases/latest/download/limbo_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the shell to execute SQL statements:

```console
Limbo
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
limbo&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT);
limbo&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
limbo&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
limbo&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add limbo
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i limbo-wasm
```

Example usage:

```js
import { Database } from &#039;limbo-wasm&#039;;

const db = new Database(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
pip install pylimbo
```

Example usage:

```python
import limbo

con = limbo.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐹 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the library and set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include limbo&#039;s target directory
```console
cargo build --package limbo-go
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/limbo/target/debug:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
3. Use the driver

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
go install github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _&quot;github.com/tursodatabase/limbo&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;sqlite3&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```

## FAQ

### How is Limbo different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Limbo is a project to build the modern evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Limbo is not - although it is evolving rapidly. As the project starts to near production readiness, we plan to rename it to just &quot;Turso&quot;. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Workspaces) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Window-Rules#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Screencasting#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Tabs)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Layout#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: no built-in support, but xwayland-satellite is [easy to set up](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-xwayland-satellite) and works very well.
    - Steam and games, including Proton: work perfectly through xwayland-satellite.
    - JetBrains IDEs, Ghidra: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Discord and other Electron apps: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Chromium and VSCode: work perfectly natively on Wayland with the right flags.
    - X11 apps that want to position windows or bars at specific screen coordinates: won&#039;t work well; you can run them in a nested compositor like [labwc](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-the-labwc-wayland-compositor) or [rootful Xwayland](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#directly-running-xwayland-in-rootful-mode).
    - Display scaling (integer or fractional) keeps X11 apps crisp, but you need the latest xwayland-satellite.
    For games, you can run them in [gamescope] at native resolution, even with display scaling.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Rust Programming Language

![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source of &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot; book.

[The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch].

[nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition

You can also read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with
the latest [stable], [beta], or [nightly] Rust releases. Be aware that issues
in those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those
releases are updated less frequently.

[stable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
[beta]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/
[nightly]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/

See the [releases] to download just the code of all the code listings that appear in the book.

[releases]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/releases

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same version that
rust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook
[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook --locked --version &lt;version_num&gt;
```

The book also uses two mdbook plugins which are part of this repository. If you
do not install them, you will see warnings when building and the output will not
look right, but you _will_ still be able to build the book. To use the plugins,
you should run:

```bash
$ cargo install --locked --path packages/mdbook-trpl
```

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in
your web browser.

_Firefox:_

```bash
$ firefox book/index.html                       # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Firefox&quot; book/index.html             # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;firefox.exe&quot; .\book\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start firefox.exe .\book\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
```

_Chrome:_

```bash
$ google-chrome book/index.html                 # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Google Chrome&quot; book/index.html       # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;chrome.exe&quot; .\book\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start chrome.exe .\book\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ cd packages/trpl
$ mdbook test --library-path packages/trpl/target/debug/deps
```

## Contributing

We&#039;d love your help! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] to learn about the
kinds of contributions we&#039;re looking for.

[contrib]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

Because the book is [printed][nostarch], and because we want
to keep the online version of the book close to the print version when
possible, it may take longer than you&#039;re used to for us to address your issue
or pull request.

So far, we&#039;ve been doing a larger revision to coincide with [Rust Editions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/). Between those larger
revisions, we will only be correcting errors. If your issue or pull request
isn&#039;t strictly fixing an error, it might sit until the next time that we&#039;re
working on a large revision: expect on the order of months or years. Thank you
for your patience!

### Translations

We&#039;d love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on
a new language! We&#039;re waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages
before we merge any in, but feel free to start!

[Translations]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATranslations
[mdbook support]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/5

## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
script available in the `ci` directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words,
which is provided in `ci/dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false
positive (say, you used the word `BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid),
you need to add this word to `ci/dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for
consistency).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># cs2-dumper

An external offset/interface dumper for Counter-Strike 2, with support for both Windows &amp; Linux. Powered
by [memflow](https://github.com/memflow/memflow).

The native Linux version is available in the [linux](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/tree/linux) branch (currently
outdated).

For a work-in-progress offline version, check out the [cs2-analyzer](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-analyzer) repository or
view its included web demo [here](https://a2x.github.io/cs2-analyzer).

## Getting Started

You can download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/releases) or compile it yourself.
Note that compiling it yourself requires your Rust compiler version to be at least 1.74.0 or newer.

## Usage

1. Ensure the game is running (Being in the main menu should suffice).
2. Run the `cs2-dumper` executable.

_Note:_ If you run the executable without specifying an optional memflow connector name, it will automatically use the
[memflow-native](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-native) OS layer to read the memory of the game process. If you
wish to use an existing memflow connector instead, such as **pcileech** or **kvm**, you can pass the `connector` and
optional `connector-args` arguments to the program. These connectors can be installed and managed using
the [memflowup](https://github.com/memflow/memflowup) tool.

E.g (for pcileech). `cs2-dumper -c pcileech -a :device=FPGA -vv`

Certain connectors, such as the [kvm](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-kvm) connector on Linux or
the [pcileech](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-pcileech) / [winio](https://github.com/a2x/memflow-winio)
connectors on Windows, require elevated privileges to work. So either run the `cs2-dumper` executable with `sudo` on
Linux or as an administrator on Windows.

### Available Arguments

- `-c, --connector &lt;connector&gt;`: The name of the memflow connector to use.
- `-a, --connector-args &lt;connector-args&gt;`: Additional arguments to pass to the memflow connector.
- `-f, --file-types &lt;file-types&gt;`: The types of files to generate. Default: `cs`, `hpp`,  `json`, `rs`.
- `-i, --indent-size &lt;indent-size&gt;`: The number of spaces to use per indentation level. Default: `4`.
- `-o, --output &lt;output&gt;`: The output directory to write the generated files to. Default: `output`.
- `-p, --process-name &lt;process-name&gt;`: The name of the game process. Default: `cs2.exe`.
- `-v...`: Increase logging verbosity. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-h, --help`: Print help.
- `-V, --version`: Print version.

## Running Tests

To run the few basic provided tests, use the following command: `cargo test -- --nocapture`.

# Status

Rustls is used in production at many organizations and projects. We aim to maintain
reasonable API surface stability but the API may evolve as we make changes to accommodate
new features or performance improvements.

We have a [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for our future plans. We also have [benchmarks](BENCHMARKING.md) to
prevent performance regressions and to let you evaluate rustls on your target hardware.

If you&#039;d like to help out, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Changelog

# Documentation

https://docs.rs/rustls/

# Approach

Rustls is a TLS library that aims to provide a good level of cryptographic security,
requires no configuration to achieve that security, and provides no unsafe features or
obsolete cryptography by default.

Rustls implements TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 for both clients and servers. See [the full
list of protocol features](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/manual/_04_features/index.html).

### Platform support

While Rustls itself is platform independent, by default it uses [`aws-lc-rs`] for implementing
the cryptography in TLS.  See [the aws-lc-rs FAQ][aws-lc-rs-platforms-faq] for more details of the
platform/architecture support constraints in aws-lc-rs.

[`ring`] is also available via the `ring` crate feature: see
[the supported `ring` target platforms][ring-target-platforms].

By providing a custom instance of the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] struct, you
can replace all cryptography dependencies of rustls.  This is a route to being portable
to a wider set of architectures and environments, or compliance requirements.  See the
[`crypto::CryptoProvider`] documentation for more details.

Specifying `default-features = false` when depending on rustls will remove the implicit
dependency on aws-lc-rs.

Rustls requires Rust 1.71 or later. It has an optional dependency on zlib-rs which requires 1.75 or later.

[aws-lc-rs-platforms-faq]: https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/faq.html#can-i-run-aws-lc-rs-on-x-platform-or-architecture
[`aws-lc-rs`]: https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs

### Cryptography providers

Since Rustls 0.22 it has been possible to choose the provider of the cryptographic primitives
that Rustls uses. This may be appealing if you have specific platform, compliance or feature
requirements that aren&#039;t met by the default provider, [`aws-lc-rs`].

Users that wish to customize the provider in use can do so when constructing `ClientConfig`
and `ServerConfig` instances using the `with_crypto_provider` method on the respective config
builder types. See the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] documentation for more details.

#### Built-in providers

Rustls ships with two built-in providers controlled by associated crate features:

* [`aws-lc-rs`] - enabled by default, available with the `aws_lc_rs` crate feature enabled.
* [`ring`] - available with the `ring` crate feature enabled.

See the documentation for [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] for details on how providers are
selected.

#### Third-party providers

The community has also started developing third-party providers for Rustls:

* [`rustls-mbedtls-provider`] - a provider that uses [`mbedtls`] for cryptography.
* [`rustls-openssl`] - a provider that uses [OpenSSL] for cryptography.
* [`boring-rustls-provider`] - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`boringssl`] for
cryptography.
* [`rustls-rustcrypto`] - an experimental provider that uses the crypto primitives
from [`RustCrypto`] for cryptography.
* [`rustls-symcrypt`] - a provider that uses Microsoft&#039;s [SymCrypt] library.
* [`rustls-wolfcrypt-provider`] - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`wolfCrypt`] for cryptography.

#### Custom provider

We also provide a simple example of writing your own provider in the [custom provider example].
This example implements a minimal provider using parts of the [`RustCrypto`] ecosystem.

See the [Making a custom CryptoProvider] section of the documentation for more information
on this topic.

# Example code

Our [examples] directory contains demos that show how to handle I/O using the
[`stream::Stream`] helper, as well as more complex asynchronous I/O using [`mio`].
If you&#039;re already using Tokio for an async runtime you may prefer to use
[`tokio-rustls`] instead of interacting with rustls directly.

The [`mio`] based examples are the most complete, and discussed below. Users
new to Rustls may prefer to look at the simple client/server examples before
diving in to the more complex MIO examples.

[examples]: examples/
[`stream::Stream`]: https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/struct.Stream.html
[`mio`]: https://docs.rs/mio/latest/mio/
[`tokio-rustls`]: https://docs.rs/tokio-rustls/latest/tokio_rustls/

## Client example program

The MIO client example program is named `tlsclient-mio`.

Some sample runs:

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --http mozilla-modern.badssl.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.6.2 (Ubuntu)
Date: Wed, 01 Jun 2016 18:44:00 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 644
(...)
```

or

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --http expired.badssl.com
TLS error: InvalidCertificate(Expired)
Connection closed
```

Run `cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --help` for more options.

## Server example program

The MIO server example program is named `tlsserver-mio`.

Here&#039;s a sample run; we start a TLS echo server, then connect to it with
`openssl` and `tlsclient-mio`:

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsserver-mio -- --certs test-ca/rsa-2048/end.fullchain --key test-ca/rsa-2048/end.key -p 8443 echo &amp;
$ echo hello world | openssl s_client -ign_eof -quiet -connect localhost:8443
depth=2 CN = ponytown RSA CA
verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain
hello world
^C
$ echo hello world | cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --cafile test-ca/rsa-2048/ca.cert --port 8443 localhost
hello world
^C
```

Run `cargo run --bin tlsserver-mio -- --help` for more options.

&lt;/p&gt;

## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

For everyone else, the detailed instructions to install Alacritty can be found
[here](INSTALL.md).

### Requirements

- At least OpenGL ES 2.0
- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)

## Configuration

You can find the documentation for Alacritty&#039;s configuration in `man 5
alacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages
installed.

[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html

Alacritty doesn&#039;t create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the
following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.toml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`

On Windows, the config file will be looked for in:

* `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty&#039;s performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn&#039;t feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it&#039;s just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won&#039;t find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

[![Build status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/ekzhang/bore/ci.yml)](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore/actions)
[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bore-cli.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/bore-cli)

A modern, simple TCP tunnel in Rust that exposes local ports to a remote server, bypassing standard NAT connection firewalls. **That&#039;s all it does: no more, and no less.**

![Video demo](https://i.imgur.com/vDeGsmx.gif)

```shell
# Installation (requires Rust, see alternatives below)
cargo install bore-cli

# On your local machine
bore local 8000 --to bore.pub
```

This will expose your local port at `localhost:8000` to the public internet at `bore.pub:&lt;PORT&gt;`, where the port number is assigned randomly.

Similar to [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) and [ngrok](https://ngrok.io/), except `bore` is intended to be a highly efficient, unopinionated tool for forwarding TCP traffic that is simple to install and easy to self-host, with no frills attached.

(`bore` totals about 400 lines of safe, async Rust code and is trivial to set up — just run a single binary for the client and server.)

## Installation

### macOS

`bore` is packaged as a Homebrew core formula.

```shell
brew install bore-cli
```

### Linux

#### Arch Linux

`bore` is available in the AUR as `bore`.

```shell
yay -S bore # or your favorite AUR helper
```

#### Gentoo Linux

`bore` is available in the [gentoo-zh](https://github.com/microcai/gentoo-zh) overlay.

```shell
sudo eselect repository enable gentoo-zh
sudo emerge --sync gentoo-zh
sudo emerge net-proxy/bore
```

### Binary Distribution

Otherwise, the easiest way to install bore is from prebuilt binaries. These are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore/releases) for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Just unzip the appropriate file for your platform and move the `bore` executable into a folder on your PATH.

### Cargo

You also can build `bore` from source using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), the Rust package manager. This command installs the `bore` binary at a user-accessible path.

```shell
cargo install bore-cli
```

### Docker

We also publish versioned Docker images for each release. The image is built for an AMD 64-bit architecture. They&#039;re tagged with the specific version and allow you to run the statically-linked `bore` binary from a minimal &quot;scratch&quot; container.

```shell
docker run -it --init --rm --network host ekzhang/bore &lt;ARGS&gt;
```

## Detailed Usage

This section describes detailed usage for the `bore` CLI command.

### Local Forwarding

You can forward a port on your local machine by using the `bore local` command. This takes a positional argument, the local port to forward, as well as a mandatory `--to` option, which specifies the address of the remote server.

```shell
bore local 5000 --to bore.pub
```

You can optionally pass in a `--port` option to pick a specific port on the remote to expose, although the command will fail if this port is not available. Also, passing `--local-host` allows you to expose a different host on your local area network besides the loopback address `localhost`.

The full options are shown below.

```shell
Starts a local proxy to the remote server

Usage: bore local [OPTIONS] --to &lt;TO&gt; &lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt;

Arguments:
  &lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt;  The local port to expose [env: BORE_LOCAL_PORT=]

Options:
  -l, --local-host &lt;HOST&gt;  The local host to expose [default: localhost]
  -t, --to &lt;TO&gt;            Address of the remote server to expose local ports to [env: BORE_SERVER=]
  -p, --port &lt;PORT&gt;        Optional port on the remote server to select [default: 0]
  -s, --secret &lt;SECRET&gt;    Optional secret for authentication [env: BORE_SECRET]
  -h, --help               Print help
```

### Self-Hosting

As mentioned in the startup instructions, there is a public instance of the `bore` server running at `bore.pub`. However, if you want to self-host `bore` on your own network, you can do so with the following command:

```shell
bore server
```

That&#039;s all it takes! After the server starts running at a given address, you can then update the `bore local` command with option `--to &lt;ADDRESS&gt;` to forward a local port to this remote server.

It&#039;s possible to specify different IP addresses for the control server and for the tunnels. This setup is useful for cases where you might want the control server to be on a private network while allowing tunnel connections over a public interface, or vice versa.

The full options for the `bore server` command are shown below.

```shell
Runs the remote proxy server

Usage: bore server [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --min-port &lt;MIN_PORT&gt;          Minimum accepted TCP port number [env: BORE_MIN_PORT=] [default: 1024]
      --max-port &lt;MAX_PORT&gt;          Maximum accepted TCP port number [env: BORE_MAX_PORT=] [default: 65535]
  -s, --secret &lt;SECRET&gt;              Optional secret for authentication [env: BORE_SECRET]
      --bind-addr &lt;BIND_ADDR&gt;        IP address to bind to, clients must reach this [default: 0.0.0.0]
      --bind-tunnels &lt;BIND_TUNNELS&gt;  IP address where tunnels will listen on, defaults to --bind-addr
  -h, --help                         Print help
```

## Protocol

There is an implicit _control port_ at `7835`, used for creating new connections on demand. At initialization, the client sends a &quot;Hello&quot; message to the server on the TCP control port, asking to proxy a selected remote port. The server then responds with an acknowledgement and begins listening for external TCP connections.

Whenever the server obtains a connection on the remote port, it generates a secure [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) for that connection and sends it back to the client. The client then opens a separate TCP stream to the server and sends an &quot;Accept&quot; message containing the UUID on that stream. The server then proxies the two connections between each other.

For correctness reasons and to avoid memory leaks, incoming connections are only stored by the server for up to 10 seconds before being discarded if the client does not accept them.

## Authentication

On a custom deployment of `bore server`, you can optionally require a _secret_ to prevent the server from being used by others. The protocol requires clients to verify possession of the secret on each TCP connection by answering random challenges in the form of HMAC codes. (This secret is only used for the initial handshake, and no further traffic is encrypted by default.)

```shell
# on the server
bore server --secret my_secret_string

# on the client
bore local &lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt; --to &lt;TO&gt; --secret my_secret_string
```

If a secret is not present in the arguments, `bore` will also attempt to read from the `BORE_SECRET` environment variable.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mullvad VPN desktop and mobile app

Welcome to the Mullvad VPN client app source code repository.
This is the VPN client software for the Mullvad VPN service.
For more information about the service, please visit our website,
[mullvad.net](https://mullvad.net) (Also accessible via Tor on our
[onion service](http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/)).

This repository contains all the source code for the
desktop and mobile versions of the app. For desktop this includes the system service/daemon
([`mullvad-daemon`](mullvad-daemon/)), a graphical user interface ([GUI](desktop/)) and a command
line interface ([CLI](mullvad-cli/)). The Android app uses the same backing system service for the
tunnel and security but has a dedicated frontend in [android/](android/). iOS consists of a
completely standalone implementation that resides in [ios/](ios/).

## Releases

There are built and signed releases for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android available on
[our website](https://mullvad.net/download/) and on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases/). The Android app is also available
on [Google Play] and [F-Droid] and the iOS version on [App Store].

[Google Play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mullvad.mullvadvpn
[F-Droid]: https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn/
[App Store]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mullvad-vpn/id1488466513

You can find our code signing keys as well as instructions for how to cryptographically verify
your download on [Mullvad&#039;s Open Source page].

### Platform/OS support

These are the operating systems and their versions that the app officially supports. It might
work on many more versions, but we don&#039;t test for those and can&#039;t guarantee the quality or
security.

| OS/Platform | Supported versions |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Windows     | 10 and 11          |
| macOS       | The three latest major releases |
| Linux (Ubuntu)| The two latest LTS releases and the latest non-LTS releases |
| Linux (Fedora) | The versions that are not yet [EOL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life) |
| Linux (Debian) | 12 and newer    |
| Android     | 8 and newer        |
| iOS         | 15.0 and newer     |

On Linux we test using the Gnome desktop environment. The app should, and probably does work
in other DEs, but we don&#039;t regularly test those.

## Features

Here is a table containing the features of the app across platforms. This is intended to reflect
the current state of the latest code in git, not necessarily any existing release.

## Security and anonymity

This app is a privacy preserving VPN client. As such it goes to great lengths to stop traffic
leaks. And basically all settings default to the more secure/private option. The user has to
explicitly allow more loose rules if desired. See the [dedicated security document] for details
on what the app blocks and allows, as well as how it does it.

[dedicated security document]: docs/security.md

## Checking out the code

This repository contains submodules needed for building the app. However, some of those submodules
also have further submodules that are quite large and not needed to build the app. So unless
you want the source code for OpenSSL, OpenVPN and a few other projects you should avoid a recursive
clone of the repository. Instead clone the repository normally and then get one level of submodules:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app.git
cd mullvadvpn-app
git submodule update --init
```

On Android, Windows, Linux and macOS you also want to checkout the wireguard-go submodule:
```bash
git submodule update --init wireguard-go-rs/libwg/wireguard-go
```
Further details on why this is necessary can be found in the [wireguard-go-rs crate](./wireguard-go-rs/README.md).

We sign every commit on the `main` branch as well as our release tags. If you would like to verify
your checkout, you can find our developer keys on [Mullvad&#039;s Open Source page].

### Binaries submodule

This repository has a git submodule at `dist-assets/binaries`. This submodule contains binaries and
build scripts for third party code we need to bundle with the app. Such as OpenVPN, Wintun
etc.

This submodule conforms to the same integrity/security standards as this repository. Every merge
commit should be signed. And this main repository should only ever point to a signed merge commit
of the binaries submodule.

See the [binaries submodule&#039;s](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app-binaries) README for more
details about that repository.

## Building the app

See the [build instructions](BuildInstructions.md) for help building the app on desktop platforms.

For building the Android app, see the [instructions](./android/BuildInstructions.md) for Android.

For building the iOS app, see the [instructions](./ios/BuildInstructions.md) for iOS.

## Releasing the app

See [this](Release.md) for instructions on how to make a new release.

## Environment variables used by the service

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DEBUG` - Helps debugging the firewall. Does different things depending on
  platform:
  * Linux: Set to `&quot;1&quot;` to add packet counters to all firewall rules.
  * macOS: Makes rules log the packets they match to the `pflog0` interface.
    * Set to `&quot;all&quot;` to add logging to all rules.
    * Set to `&quot;pass&quot;` to add logging to rules allowing packets.
    * Set to `&quot;drop&quot;` to add logging to rules blocking packets.

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_SRC_VALID_MARK` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from
    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark` kernel parameter to `1` on Linux when a tunnel
    is established.
    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise strict reverse path filtering
    may prevent relay traffic from reaching the daemon. If `rp_filter` is set to `1` on the interface
    that will be receiving relay traffic, and `src_valid_mark` is not set to `1`, the daemon will
    not be able to receive relay traffic.

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_ARP_IGNORE` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from
    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` kernel parameter to `2` on Linux when a tunnel
    is established.
    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise an attacker who can send ARP
    requests to the device running Mullvad can figure out the in-tunnel IP.

* `TALPID_DNS_MODULE` - Allows changing the method that will be used for DNS configuration.
  By default this is automatically detected, but you can set it to one of the options below to
  choose a specific method.

  * Linux
    * `&quot;static-file&quot;`: change the `/etc/resolv.conf` file directly
    * `&quot;resolvconf&quot;`: use the `resolvconf` program
    * `&quot;systemd&quot;`: use systemd&#039;s `resolved` service through DBus
    * `&quot;network-manager&quot;`: use `NetworkManager` service through DBus

  * Windows
    * `iphlpapi`: use the IP helper API
    * `netsh`: use the `netsh` program
    * `tcpip`: set TCP/IP parameters in the registry

- `TALPID_DISABLE_LOCAL_DNS_RESOLVER` - Set this variable to `1` to disable the local DNS resolver (macOS only).

* `TALPID_FORCE_USERSPACE_WIREGUARD` - Forces the daemon to use the userspace implementation of
   WireGuard on Linux.

* `TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR` - Forces the daemon to always assume the host is online.

* `TALPID_NET_CLS_MOUNT_DIR` - On Linux, forces the daemon to mount the `net_cls` controller in the
  specified directory if it isn&#039;t mounted already.

* `MULLVAD_MANAGEMENT_SOCKET_GROUP` - On Linux and macOS, this restricts access to the management
  interface UDS socket to users in the specified group. This means that only users in that group can
  use the CLI and GUI. By default, everyone has access to the socket.

* `MULLVAD_BACKTRACE_ON_FAULT` - When enabled, if the daemon encounters a fault (e.g. `SIGSEGV`),
  it will log a backtrace to stdout, and to `daemon.log`. By default, this is disabled in
  release-builds and enabled in debug-builds. Set variable to `1` or `0` to explicitly enable or
  disable this feature. Logging the backtrace cause heap allocation. Allocation is not signal safe,
  but here it runs in the signal handler. This in technically undefined behavior and therefore
  disabled by default. This usually works, but enable at your own risk.

### Development builds only

* `MULLVAD_API_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in API requests. E.g. `api.mullvad.net`.

* `MULLVAD_API_ADDR` - Set the IP address and port to use in API requests. E.g. `10.10.1.2:443`.

* `MULLVAD_API_DISABLE_TLS` - Use plain HTTP for API requests.

* `MULLVAD_CONNCHECK_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in connection check requests. E.g. `am.i.mullvad.net`.

### Setting environment variables

#### Windows

Use `setx` from an elevated shell:

```bat
setx TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE 1 /m
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bat
sc.exe stop mullvadvpn
sc.exe start mullvadvpn
```

#### Linux

Edit the systemd unit file via `systemctl edit mullvad-daemon.service`:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=&quot;TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR=1&quot;
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mullvad-daemon
```

#### macOS

Use `plutil`:

```bash
sudo plutil -replace EnvironmentVariables -json &#039;{&quot;TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR&quot;: &quot;1&quot;}&#039; /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bash
launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
```

## Environment variables used by the desktop frontend

* `MULLVAD_PATH` - Allows changing the path to the folder with the `mullvad-problem-report` tool
   when running in development mode. Defaults to: `&lt;repo&gt;/target/debug/`.
* `MULLVAD_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION` - If set to `1`, notification will be disabled when
   an update is available.


## Command line tools for Electron app development

- `$ npm run develop` - develop app with live-reload enabled
- `$ npm run lint` - lint code
- `$ npm run pack:&lt;OS&gt;` - prepare app for distribution for your platform. Where `&lt;OS&gt;` can be
  `linux`, `mac` or `win`

crate that builds the final daemon binary is `mullvad-daemon` which then depend on the others.

In general one can look at the daemon as split into two parts, the crates starting with `talpid`
and the crates starting with `mullvad`. The `talpid` crates are supposed to be completely unrelated
to Mullvad specific things. A `talpid` crate is not allowed to know anything about the API through
which the daemon fetch Mullvad account details or download VPN server lists for example. The
`talpid` components should be viewed as a generic VPN client with extra privacy and anonymity
preserving features. The crates having `mullvad` in their name on the other hand make use of the
`talpid` components to build a secure and Mullvad specific VPN client.


- **Cargo.toml** - Main Rust workspace definition. See this file for which folders here are daemon
  Rust crates.
- **mullvad-daemon/** - Main Rust crate building the daemon binary.
- **talpid-core/** - Main crate of the VPN client implementation itself. Completely Mullvad agnostic
  privacy preserving VPN client library.


## Vocabulary

Explanations for some common words used in the documentation and code in this repository.

- **App** - This entire product (everything in this repository) is the &quot;Mullvad VPN App&quot;, or App for
  short.
  - **Daemon** - Refers to the `mullvad-daemon` Rust program. This headless program exposes a
    management interface that can be used to control the daemon
  - **Frontend** - Term used for any program or component that connects to the daemon management
    interface and allows a user to control the daemon.
    - **GUI** - The Electron + React program that is a graphical frontend for the Mullvad VPN App.
    - **CLI** - The Rust program named `mullvad` that is a terminal based frontend for the Mullvad
      VPN app.

&lt;br /&gt;

SQLx is an async, pure Rust&lt;sub&gt;†&lt;/sub&gt; SQL crate featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL.

-   **Truly Asynchronous**. Built from the ground-up using async/await for maximum concurrency.

-   **Compile-time checked queries** (if you want). See [SQLx is not an ORM](#sqlx-is-not-an-orm).

-   **Database Agnostic**. Support for [PostgreSQL], [MySQL], [MariaDB], [SQLite].
    -   [MSSQL] was supported prior to version 0.7, but has been removed pending a full rewrite of the driver as part of our [SQLx Pro initiative].

-   **Pure Rust**. The Postgres and MySQL/MariaDB drivers are written in pure Rust using **zero** unsafe&lt;sub&gt;††&lt;/sub&gt; code.

-   **Runtime Agnostic**. Works on different runtimes ([`async-std`] / [`tokio`] / [`actix`]) and TLS backends ([`native-tls`], [`rustls`]).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;

† The SQLite driver uses the libsqlite3 C library as SQLite is an embedded database (the only way
we could be pure Rust for SQLite is by porting _all_ of SQLite to Rust).

†† SQLx uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` unless the `sqlite` feature is enabled.
The SQLite driver directly invokes the SQLite3 API via `libsqlite3-sys`, which requires `unsafe`.

&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

---

-   Cross-platform. Being native Rust, SQLx will compile anywhere Rust is supported.

-   Built-in connection pooling with `sqlx::Pool`.

-   Row streaming. Data is read asynchronously from the database and decoded on demand.

-   Automatic statement preparation and caching. When using the high-level query API (`sqlx::query`), statements are
    prepared and cached per connection.

-   Simple (unprepared) query execution including fetching results into the same `Row` types used by
    the high-level API. Supports batch execution and returns results from all statements.

-   Transport Layer Security (TLS) where supported ([MySQL], [MariaDB] and [PostgreSQL]).

-   Asynchronous notifications using `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for [PostgreSQL].

-   Nested transactions with support for save points.

-   `Any` database driver for changing the database driver at runtime. An `AnyPool` connects to the driver indicated by the URL scheme.

## Install

SQLx is compatible with the [`async-std`], [`tokio`], and [`actix`] runtimes; and, the [`native-tls`] and [`rustls`] TLS backends. When adding the dependency, you must choose a runtime feature that is `runtime` + `tls`.

[`async-std`]: https://github.com/async-rs/async-std
[`tokio`]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio
[`actix`]: https://github.com/actix/actix-net
[`native-tls`]: https://crates.io/crates/native-tls
[`rustls`]: https://crates.io/crates/rustls

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
# PICK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

# tokio (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot; ] }
# tokio + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }

# async-std (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot; ] }
# async-std + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }
```

#### Cargo Feature Flags

For backward-compatibility reasons, the runtime and TLS features can either be chosen together as a single feature,
or separately.

For forward compatibility, you should use the separate runtime and TLS features as the combination features may
be removed in the future.

-   `runtime-async-std`: Use the `async-std` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-async-std-native-tls`: Use the `async-std` runtime and `native-tls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-async-std-rustls`: Use the `async-std` runtime and `rustls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-tokio`: Use the `tokio` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-tokio-native-tls`: Use the `tokio` runtime and `native-tls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-tokio-rustls`: Use the `tokio` runtime and `rustls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

    - Actix-web is fully compatible with Tokio and so a separate runtime feature is no longer needed.

-   `tls-native-tls`: Use the `native-tls` TLS backend (OpenSSL on *nix, SChannel on Windows, Secure Transport on macOS).

-   `tls-rustls`: Use the `rustls` TLS backend (cross-platform backend, only supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3).

-   `postgres`: Add support for the Postgres database server.

-   `mysql`: Add support for the MySQL/MariaDB database server.

-   `mssql`: Add support for the MSSQL database server.

-   `sqlite`: Add support for the self-contained [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database engine with SQLite bundled and statically-linked.

-   `sqlite-unbundled`: The same as above (`sqlite`), but link SQLite from the system instead of the bundled version.
    * Allows updating SQLite independently of SQLx or using forked versions.
    * You must have SQLite installed on the system or provide a path to the library at build time.
       See [the `rusqlite` README](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite?tab=readme-ov-file#notes-on-building-rusqlite-and-libsqlite3-sys) for details.
    * May result in link errors if the SQLite version is too old. Version `3.20.0` or newer is recommended.
    * Can increase build time due to the use of bindgen.

-   `sqlite-preupdate-hook`: enables SQLite&#039;s [preupdate hook](https://sqlite.org/c3ref/preupdate_count.html) API.
    * Exposed as a separate feature because it&#039;s generally not enabled by default.
    * Using this feature with `sqlite-unbundled` may cause linker failures if the system SQLite version does not support it.

-   `any`: Add support for the `Any` database driver, which can proxy to a database driver at runtime.

-   `derive`: Add support for the derive family macros, those are `FromRow`, `Type`, `Encode`, `Decode`.

-   `macros`: Add support for the `query*!` macros, which allows compile-time checked queries.

-   `migrate`: Add support for the migration management and `migrate!` macro, which allow compile-time embedded migrations.

-   `uuid`: Add support for UUID.

-   `chrono`: Add support for date and time types from `chrono`.

-   `time`: Add support for date and time types from `time` crate (alternative to `chrono`, which is preferred by `query!` macro, if both enabled)

-   `bstr`: Add support for `bstr::BString`.

-   `bigdecimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `bigdecimal` crate.

-   `rust_decimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `rust_decimal` crate.

-   `ipnet`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnet` crate.

-   `ipnetwork`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnetwork` crate.

-   `json`: Add support for `JSON` and `JSONB` (in postgres) using the `serde_json` crate.

-   Offline mode is now always enabled. See [sqlx-cli/README.md][readme-offline].

[readme-offline]: sqlx-cli/README.md#enable-building-in-offline-mode-with-query

## SQLx is not an ORM!

SQLx supports **compile-time checked queries**. It does not, however, do this by providing a Rust
API or DSL (domain-specific language) for building queries. Instead, it provides macros that take
regular SQL as input and ensure that it is valid for your database. The way this works is that
SQLx connects to your development DB at compile time to have the database itself verify (and return
some info on) your SQL queries. This has some potentially surprising implications:

- Since SQLx never has to parse the SQL string itself, any syntax that the development DB accepts
  can be used (including things added by database extensions)
- Due to the different amount of information databases let you retrieve about queries, the extent of
  SQL verification you get from the query macros depends on the database

**If you are looking for an (asynchronous) ORM,** you can check out our new [Ecosystem wiki page](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/wiki/Ecosystem#orms)!

## Usage

See the `examples/` folder for more in-depth usage.

### Quickstart

```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPoolOptions;
// use sqlx::mysql::MySqlPoolOptions;
// etc.

#[async_std::main] // Requires the `attributes` feature of `async-std`
// or #[tokio::main]
// or #[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    // Create a connection pool
    //  for MySQL/MariaDB, use MySqlPoolOptions::new()
    //  for SQLite, use SqlitePoolOptions::new()
    //  etc.
    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .connect(&quot;postgres://postgres:password@localhost/test&quot;).await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter (use a question mark `?` instead of `$1` for MySQL/MariaDB)
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as(&quot;SELECT $1&quot;)
        .bind(150_i64)
        .fetch_one(&amp;pool).await?;

    assert_eq!(row.0, 150);

    Ok(())
}
```


### Connecting

A single connection can be established using any of the database connection types and calling `connect()`.

```rust
use sqlx::Connection;

let conn = SqliteConnection::connect(&quot;sqlite::memory:&quot;).await?;
```

Generally, you will want to instead create a connection pool (`sqlx::Pool`) for the application to
regulate how many server-side connections it&#039;s using.

```rust
let pool = MySqlPool::connect(&quot;mysql://user:pass@host/database&quot;).await?;
```

### Querying

In SQL, queries can be separated into prepared (parameterized) or unprepared (simple). Prepared queries have their
query plan _cached_, use a binary mode of communication (lower bandwidth and faster decoding), and utilize parameters
to avoid SQL injection. Unprepared queries are simple and intended only for use where a prepared statement
will not work, such as various database commands (e.g., `PRAGMA` or `SET` or `BEGIN`).

SQLx supports all operations with both types of queries. In SQLx, a `&amp;str` is treated as an unprepared query,
and a `Query` or `QueryAs` struct is treated as a prepared query.

```rust
// low-level, Executor trait
conn.execute(&quot;BEGIN&quot;).await?; // unprepared, simple query
conn.execute(sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;)).await?; // prepared, cached query
```

We should prefer to use the high-level `query` interface whenever possible. To make this easier, there are finalizers
on the type to avoid the need to wrap with an executor.

```rust
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;mut conn).await?;
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;pool).await?;
```

The `execute` query finalizer returns the number of affected rows, if any, and drops all received results.
In addition, there are `fetch`, `fetch_one`, `fetch_optional`, and `fetch_all` to receive results.

The `Query` type returned from `sqlx::query` will return `Row&lt;&#039;conn&gt;` from the database. Column values can be accessed
by ordinal or by name with `row.get()`. As the `Row` retains an immutable borrow on the connection, only one
`Row` may exist at a time.

The `fetch` query finalizer returns a stream-like type that iterates through the rows in the result sets.

```rust
// provides `try_next`
use futures::TryStreamExt;
// provides `try_get`
use sqlx::Row;

let mut rows = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?&quot;)
    .bind(email)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);

while let Some(row) = rows.try_next().await? {
    // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    let email: &amp;str = row.try_get(&quot;email&quot;)?;
}
```

To assist with mapping the row into a domain type, one of two idioms may be used:

```rust
let mut stream = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
    .map(|row: PgRow| {
        // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    })
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct User { name: String, id: i64 }

let mut stream = sqlx::query_as::&lt;_, User&gt;(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? OR name = ?&quot;)
    .bind(user_email)
    .bind(user_name)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

Instead of a stream of results, we can use `fetch_one` or `fetch_optional` to request one required or optional result
from the database.

### Compile-time verification

We can use the macro, `sqlx::query!` to achieve compile-time syntactic and semantic verification of the SQL, with
an output to an anonymous record type where each SQL column is a Rust field (using raw identifiers where needed).

```rust
let countries = sqlx::query!(
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;{ country: String, count: i64 }&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

Differences from `query()`:

-   The input (or bind) parameters must be given all at once (and they are compile-time validated to be
    the right number and the right type).

-   The output type is an anonymous record. In the above example the type would be similar to:

    ```rust
    { country: String, count: i64 }
    ```

-   The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be set at build time to a database which it can prepare
    queries against; the database does not have to contain any data but must be the same
    kind (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) and have the same schema as the database you will be connecting to at runtime.

    For convenience, you can use [a `.env` file][dotenv]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to set DATABASE_URL so that you don&#039;t have to pass it every time:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mysql://localhost/my_database
    ```

[dotenv]: https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv#examples

The biggest downside to `query!()` is that the output type cannot be named (due to Rust not
officially supporting anonymous records). To address that, there is a `query_as!()` macro that is
mostly identical except that you can name the output type.

```rust
// no traits are needed
struct Country { country: String, count: i64 }

let countries = sqlx::query_as!(Country,
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;Country&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

To avoid the need of having a development database around to compile the project even when no
modifications (to the database-accessing parts of the code) are done, you can enable &quot;offline mode&quot;
to cache the results of the SQL query analysis using the `sqlx` command-line tool. See
[sqlx-cli/README.md](./sqlx-cli/README.md#enable-building-in-offline-mode-with-query).

Compile-time verified queries do quite a bit of work at compile time. Incremental actions like
`cargo check` and `cargo build` can be significantly faster when using an optimized build by
putting the following in your `Cargo.toml` (More information in the
[Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html) of The Cargo Book)

```toml
[profile.dev.package.sqlx-macros]
opt-level = 3
```

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The `dotenv` crate itself appears abandoned as of [December 2021](https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv/issues/74)
so we now use the `dotenvy` crate instead. The file format is the same.

## Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% Safe Rust.

If the `sqlite` feature is enabled, this is downgraded to `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` on the
`sqlx::sqlite` module. There are several places where we interact with the C SQLite API. We try to document each call for the invariants we&#039;re assuming. We absolutely welcome auditing of, and feedback on, our unsafe code usage.

---

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **If you want to experience a more powerful AI wrapper application, you can try the Noi (https://github.com/lencx/Noi), which is a successor to the ChatGPT desktop application concept.**

---

This is an unofficial project solely intended for personal learning and research. Since the ChatGPT desktop application was open-sourced, it has garnered a lot of attention, and I want to thank everyone for their support. However, as the project progressed, two issues have arisen that greatly impact its future development:

- Some individuals have repackaged and sold it for profit.
- The name and icon of ChatGPT could potentially lead to infringement disputes.

## Live Demo

- [ChatGPT Desktop Application v1.0.0](https://youtu.be/IIuuB5vFFAQ)
- [ChatGPT automatically performs the &quot;Continue generating&quot; button, freeing up your hands.](https://youtu.be/bbL5cPmiGig)

## 📦 Install

- [📝 Update Log](./UPDATE_LOG.md)
- [🕒 History versions...](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/releases)

&lt;!-- tr-download-start --&gt;

### Windows

- [ChatGPT_1.1.0_windows_x86_64.msi](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/releases/download/v1.1.0/ChatGPT_1.1.0_windows_x86_64.msi): Direct download installer
- Use [winget](https://winstall.app/apps/lencx.ChatGPT):

  ```bash
  # install the latest version
  winget install --id=lencx.ChatGPT -e

  # install the specified version
  winget install --id=lencx.ChatGPT -e --version 1.1.0
  ```

**Note: If the installation path and application name are the same, it will lead to conflict ([#142](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/142))**

### Mac

- [ChatGPT_1.1.0_macos_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/releases/download/v1.1.0/ChatGPT_1.1.0_macos_aarch64.dmg): Direct download installer
- [ChatGPT_1.1.0_macos_x86_64.dmg](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/releases/download/v1.1.0/ChatGPT_1.1.0_macos_x86_64.dmg): Direct download installer
- Homebrew \
  Or you can install with _[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) ([Cask](https://docs.brew.sh/Cask-Cookbook)):_
  ```sh
  brew tap lencx/chatgpt https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT.git
  brew install --cask chatgpt --no-quarantine
  ```
  Also, if you keep a _[Brewfile](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle#usage)_, you can add something like this:
  ```rb
  repo = &quot;lencx/chatgpt&quot;
  tap repo, &quot;https://github.com/#{repo}.git&quot;
  cask &quot;chatgpt&quot;, args: { &quot;no-quarantine&quot;: true }
  ```

**If you encounter the error message `&quot;ChatGPT&quot; is damaged and can&#039;t be opened. You should move it to the Trash`. while installing software on macOS, it may be due to security settings restrictions in macOS. To solve this problem, please try the following command in Terminal:**

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /YOUR_PATH/ChatGPT.app
```

### Linux

- [ChatGPT_1.1.0_linux_x86_64.deb](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/releases/download/v1.1.0/ChatGPT_1.1.0_linux_x86_64.deb): Download `.deb` installer, advantage small size, disadvantage poor compatibility
- [ChatGPT_1.1.0_linux_x86_64.AppImage.tar.gz](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/releases/download/v1.1.0/ChatGPT_1.1.0_linux_x86_64.AppImage.tar.gz): Works reliably, you can try it if `.deb` fails to run

&lt;!-- tr-download-end --&gt;

## ChatGPT Prompts!

You can look at **[awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)** to find interesting features to import into the app. You can also use `Sync Prompts` to sync all in one click, and if you don&#039;t want certain prompts to appear in your slash commands, you can disable them.

![chatgpt cmd](./assets/chatgpt-cmd.png)

## ✨ Features

- Multi-platform: `macOS` `Linux` `Windows`
- Text-to-Speech
- Export ChatGPT history (PNG, PDF and Markdown)
- Automatic application upgrade notification
- Common shortcut keys
- System tray hover window
- Powerful menu items
- Support for slash commands and their configuration (can be configured manually or synchronized from a file [#55](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/55))
- Customize global shortcuts ([#108](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/108))
- Pop-up Search ([#122](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/122) mouse selected content, no more than 400 characters): The application is built using Tauri, and due to its security restrictions, some of the action buttons will not work, so we recommend going to your browser.

## Thanks

- The core implementation of the share button code was copied from the [@liady](https://github.com/liady) extension with some modifications.
- Thanks to the [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) repository for inspiring the custom command function for this application.

# Arnis [![CI Build Status](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/actions) [&lt;img alt=&quot;GitHub Release&quot; src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/louis-e/arnis&quot; /&gt;](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases) [&lt;img alt=&quot;GitHub Downloads (all assets, all releases&quot; src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/louis-e/arnis/total&quot; /&gt;](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases)

Arnis creates complex and accurate Minecraft Java Edition worlds that reflect real-world geography and architecture using OpenStreetMap.

###### ⚠️ This Github page is the official project website. Do not download Arnis from any other website.

## :desktop_computer: Example
![Minecraft Preview](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/mc.gif?raw=true)

Arnis is designed to handle large-scale data and generate rich, immersive environments that bring real-world cities, landmarks, and natural features into Minecraft. Whether you&#039;re looking to replicate your hometown, explore urban environments, or simply build something unique and realistic, Arnis generates your vision.

## :keyboard: Usage
&lt;img width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/gui.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases/) or [compile](#trophy-open-source) the project on your own.
 
Choose your area using the rectangle tool and select your Minecraft world - then simply click on &#039;Start Generation&#039;!

&gt; The world will always be generated starting from the Minecraft coordinates 0 0 0 (/tp 0 0 0). This is the top left of your selected area.
Minecraft version 1.16.5 and below is currently not supported, but we are working on it! For the best results, use Minecraft version 1.21.4 or above.
If you choose to select an own world, be aware that Arnis will overwrite certain areas.

[[Arch Linux AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/arnis)]

## :floppy_disk: How it works
![CLI Generation](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/cli.gif?raw=true)

The raw data obtained from the API *[(see FAQ)](#question-faq)* includes each element (buildings, walls, fountains, farmlands, etc.) with its respective corner coordinates (nodes) and descriptive tags. When you run Arnis, the following steps are performed automatically to generate a Minecraft world:

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Fetching Data from the Overpass API:** The script retrieves geospatial data for the desired bounding box from the Overpass API.
2. **Parsing Raw Data:** The raw data is parsed to extract essential information like nodes, ways, and relations. Nodes are converted into Minecraft coordinates, and relations are handled similarly to ways, ensuring all relevant elements are processed correctly. Relations and ways cluster several nodes into one specific object.
3. **Prioritizing and Sorting Elements:** The elements (nodes, ways, relations) are sorted by priority to establish a layering system, which ensures that certain types of elements (e.g., entrances and buildings) are generated in the correct order to avoid conflicts and overlapping structures.
4. **Generating Minecraft World:** The Minecraft world is generated using a series of element processors (generate_buildings, generate_highways, generate_landuse, etc.) that interpret the tags and nodes of each element to place the appropriate blocks in the Minecraft world. These processors handle the logic for creating 3D structures, roads, natural formations, and more, as specified by the processed data.
5. **Generating Ground Layer:** A ground layer is generated based on the provided scale factors to provide a base for the entire Minecraft world. This step ensures all areas have an appropriate foundation (e.g., grass and dirt layers).
6. **Saving the Minecraft World:** All the modified chunks are saved back to the Minecraft region files.

## :question: FAQ
- *Wasn&#039;t this written in Python before?*&lt;br&gt;
Yes! Arnis was initially developed in Python, which benefited from Python&#039;s open-source friendliness and ease of readability. This is why we strive for clear, well-documented code in the Rust port of this project to find the right balance. I decided to port the project to Rust to learn more about the language and push the algorithm&#039;s performance further. We were nearing the limits of optimization in Python, and Rust&#039;s capabilities allow for even better performance and efficiency. The old Python implementation is still available in the python-legacy branch.
- *Where does the data come from?*&lt;br&gt;
The geographic data is sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM)[^1], a free, collaborative mapping project that serves as an open-source alternative to commercial mapping services. The data is accessed via the Overpass API, which queries OSM&#039;s database. Other services like Google Maps do not provide data like this, which makes OSM perfect for this project.
- *How does the Minecraft world generation work?*&lt;br&gt;
The script uses the [fastnbt](https://github.com/owengage/fastnbt) cargo package to interact with Minecraft&#039;s world format. This library allows Arnis to manipulate Minecraft region files, enabling the generation of real-world locations. The section &#039;Processing Pipeline&#039; goes a bit further into the details and steps of the generation process itself.
- *Where does the name come from?*&lt;br&gt;
The project is named after the smallest city in Germany, Arnis[^2]. The city&#039;s small size made it an ideal test case for developing and debugging the algorithm efficiently.
- *I don&#039;t have Minecraft installed but want to generate a world for my kids. How?*&lt;br&gt;
When selecting a world, click on &#039;Select existing world&#039; and choose a directory. The world will be generated there.
- *Arnis instantly closes again or the window is empty!*&lt;br&gt;
  If you&#039;re on Windows, please install the [Evergreen Bootstrapper from Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH#download).

  If you&#039;re on Linux, your system might be missing the webkit2gtk-4.1 library, install the corresponding package using your distro&#039;s package manager.
- *What Minecraft version should I use?*&lt;br&gt;
Please use Minecraft version 1.21.4 for the best results. Minecraft version 1.16.5 and below is currently not supported, but we are working on it!
- *The generation did finish, but there&#039;s nothing in the world!*&lt;br&gt;
Make sure to teleport to the generation starting point (/tp 0 0 0). If there is still nothing, you might need to travel a bit further into the positive X and positive Z direction.
- *What features are in the world generation settings?*&lt;br&gt;
**Terrain:** Make sure to enable this feature to generate your world with elevation data included.&lt;br&gt;
**Scale Factor:** The scale factor determines the size of the generated world.&lt;br&gt;
**Custom BBOX Input:** This setting allows you to manually input the bounding box coordinates for the area you want to generate.&lt;br&gt;
**Floodfill-Timeout (Sec):** This setting determines the maximum time the floodfill algorithm is allowed to run before being terminated. Increasing this value may improve the generation of large water areas but may also increase processing time.&lt;br&gt;
**Ground Height:** This setting determines the base height of the generated world and can be adjusted to create different terrain types.

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 30TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 100 contributors** and growing.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># 🚀 DeepProve: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkml) Inference

Welcome to **DeepProve**, a cutting-edge framework designed to prove neural network inference using zero-knowledge cryptographic techniques. Whether you&#039;re working with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), DeepProve offers a fast and efficient way to verify computations without revealing the underlying data.
zkml is the name of the subcrate implementing the proving logic.

## 🤔 What Does DeepProve Do?

DeepProve leverages advanced cryptographic methods like sumchecks and logup GKR to achieve sublinear proving times. This means you can prove the correctness of your model&#039;s inference faster than ever before!

### 📊 Benchmark Highlights

CNN 264k: This runs a CNN on the cifar 10 dataset for a total of 264k parameters. DeepProve is proving 158x faster at this size!
Dense 4M: This runs a multiple dense layers for a total of 4 million parameters. DeepProve is proving 54x faster at this size!

| Model Type | ZKML Proving Time (ms) | ZKML Verification Time (ms) | EZKL Proving Time (ms) | EZKL Verification Time (ms) |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| CNN 264k   | 1242                   | 599                         | 196567.01              | 312505                      |
| Dense 4M   | 2335                   | 520                         | 126831.3               | 1112                        |

## 🌟 Use Cases

Proving inference of AI models has a wide range of applications, especially in scenarios where privacy and trust are paramount. For instance, in healthcare, sensitive patient data can be used to make predictions without exposing the data itself. In finance, models can be verified for compliance without revealing proprietary algorithms. Additionally, in decentralized applications, zero-knowledge proofs can ensure the integrity of AI computations on the blockchain, fostering trust and transparency. These use cases highlight the transformative potential of ZKML in various industries.
