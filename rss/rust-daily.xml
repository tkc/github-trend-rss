## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex  # Alternatively: `brew install codex`
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

After you run `codex` select Sign in with ChatGPT. You&#039;ll need a Plus, Pro, or Team ChatGPT account, and will get access to our latest models, including `gpt-5`, at no extra cost to your plan. (Enterprise is coming soon.)

&gt; Important: If you&#039;ve used the Codex CLI before, you&#039;ll need to follow these steps to migrate from usage-based billing with your API key:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Update the CLI with `codex update` and ensure `codex --version` is greater than 0.13
&gt; 2. Ensure that there is no `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set. (Check that `env | grep &#039;OPENAI_API_KEY&#039;` returns empty)
&gt; 3. Run `codex login` again

If you encounter problems with the login flow, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Connecting through VPS or remote

If you run Codex on a remote machine (VPS/server) without a local browser, the login helper starts a server on `localhost:1455` on the remote host. To complete login in your local browser, forward that port to your machine before starting the login flow:

```bash
# From your local machine
ssh -L 1455:localhost:1455 &lt;user&gt;@&lt;remote-host&gt;
```

Then, in that SSH session, run `codex` and select &quot;Sign in with ChatGPT&quot;. When prompted, open the printed URL (it will be `http://localhost:1455/...`) in your local browser. The traffic will be tunneled to the remote server.

### Usage-based billing alternative: Use an OpenAI API key

If you prefer to pay-as-you-go, you can still authenticate with your OpenAI API key by setting it as an environment variable:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
```

Notes:

- This command only sets the key for your current terminal session, which we recommend. To set it for all future sessions, you can also add the `export` line to your shell&#039;s configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`).
- If you have signed in with ChatGPT, Codex will default to using your ChatGPT credits. If you wish to use your API key, use the `/logout` command to clear your ChatGPT authentication.

### Choosing Codex&#039;s level of autonomy

We always recommend running Codex in its default sandbox that gives you strong guardrails around what the agent can do. The default sandbox prevents it from editing files outside its workspace, or from accessing the network.

When you launch Codex in a new folder, it detects whether the folder is version controlled and recommends one of two levels of autonomy:

#### **1. Read/write**

- Codex can run commands and write files in the workspace without approval.
- To write files in other folders, access network, update git or perform other actions protected by the sandbox, Codex will need your permission.
- By default, the workspace includes the current directory, as well as temporary directories like `/tmp`. You can see what directories are in the workspace with the `/status` command. See the docs for how to customize this behavior.
- Advanced: You can manually specify this configuration by running `codex --sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval on-request`
- This is the recommended default for version-controlled folders.

#### **2. Read-only**

- Codex can run read-only commands without approval.
- To edit files, access network, or perform other actions protected by the sandbox, Codex will need your permission.
- Advanced: You can manually specify this configuration by running `codex --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request`
- This is the recommended default non-version-controlled folders.

#### **3. Advanced configuration**

Codex gives you fine-grained control over the sandbox with the `--sandbox` option, and over when it requests approval with the `--ask-for-approval` option. Run `codex help` for more on these options.

#### Can I run without ANY approvals?

Yes, run codex non-interactively with `--ask-for-approval never`. This option works with all `--sandbox` options, so you still have full control over Codex&#039;s level of autonomy. It will make its best attempt with whatever contrainsts you provide. For example:

- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox read-only` when you are running many agents to answer questions in parallel in the same workspace.
- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox workspace-write` when you want the agent to non-interactively take time to produce the best outcome, with strong guardrails around its behavior.
- Use `codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox danger-full-access` to dangerously give the agent full autonomy. Because this disables important safety mechanisms, we recommend against using this unless running Codex in an isolated environment.

#### Fine-tuning in `config.toml`

```toml
# approval mode
approval_policy = &quot;untrusted&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;read-only&quot;

# full-auto mode
approval_policy = &quot;on-request&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;workspace-write&quot;

# Optional: allow network in workspace-write mode
[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

You can also save presets as **profiles**:

```toml
[profiles.full_auto]
approval_policy = &quot;on-request&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;workspace-write&quot;

[profiles.readonly_quiet]
approval_policy = &quot;never&quot;
sandbox_mode    = &quot;read-only&quot;
```

### Example prompts

Below are a few bite-size examples you can copy-paste. Replace the text in quotes with your own task. See the [prompting guide](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-cli/examples/prompting_guide.md) for more tips and usage patterns.

| ✨  | What you type                                                                   | What happens                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `codex &quot;Refactor the Dashboard component to React Hooks&quot;`                       | Codex rewrites the class component, runs `npm test`, and shows the diff.   |
| 2   | `codex &quot;Generate SQL migrations for adding a users table&quot;`                      | Infers your ORM, creates migration files, and runs them in a sandboxed DB. |
| 3   | `codex &quot;Write unit tests for utils/date.ts&quot;`                                    | Generates tests, executes them, and iterates until they pass.              |
| 4   | `codex &quot;Bulk-rename *.jpeg -&gt; *.jpg with git mv&quot;`                               | Safely renames files and updates imports/usages.                           |
| 5   | `codex &quot;Explain what this regex does: ^(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}$&quot;`                      | Outputs a step-by-step human explanation.                                  |
| 6   | `codex &quot;Carefully review this repo, and propose 3 high impact well-scoped PRs&quot;` | Suggests impactful PRs in the current codebase.                            |
| 7   | `codex &quot;Look for vulnerabilities and create a security review report&quot;`          | Finds and explains security bugs.                                          |

## Running with a prompt as input

You can also run Codex CLI with a prompt as input:

```shell
codex &quot;explain this codebase to me&quot;
```

```shell
codex --full-auto &quot;create the fanciest todo-list app&quot;
```

That&#039;s it - Codex will scaffold a file, run it inside a sandbox, install any
missing dependencies, and show you the live result. Approve the changes and
they&#039;ll be committed to your working directory.

## Using Open Source Models

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;--profile&lt;/code&gt; to use other models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Codex also allows you to use other providers that support the OpenAI Chat Completions (or Responses) API.

To do so, you must first define custom [providers](./config.md#model_providers) in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For example, the provider for a standard Ollama setup would be defined as follows:

```toml
[model_providers.ollama]
name = &quot;Ollama&quot;
base_url = &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1&quot;
```

The `base_url` will have `/chat/completions` appended to it to build the full URL for the request.

For providers that also require an `Authorization` header of the form `Bearer: SECRET`, an `env_key` can be specified, which indicates the environment variable to read to use as the value of `SECRET` when making a request:

```toml
[model_providers.openrouter]
name = &quot;OpenRouter&quot;
base_url = &quot;https://openrouter.ai/api/v1&quot;
env_key = &quot;OPENROUTER_API_KEY&quot;
```

Providers that speak the Responses API are also supported by adding `wire_api = &quot;responses&quot;` as part of the definition. Accessing OpenAI models via Azure is an example of such a provider, though it also requires specifying additional `query_params` that need to be appended to the request URL:

```toml
[model_providers.azure]
name = &quot;Azure&quot;
# Make sure you set the appropriate subdomain for this URL.
base_url = &quot;https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai&quot;
env_key = &quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;  # Or &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;, whichever you use.
# Newer versions appear to support the responses API, see https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/1321
query_params = { api-version = &quot;2025-04-01-preview&quot; }
wire_api = &quot;responses&quot;
```

Once you have defined a provider you wish to use, you can configure it as your default provider as follows:

```toml
model_provider = &quot;azure&quot;
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you find yourself experimenting with a variety of models and providers, then you likely want to invest in defining a _profile_ for each configuration like so:

```toml
[profiles.o3]
model_provider = &quot;azure&quot;
model = &quot;o3&quot;

[profiles.mistral]
model_provider = &quot;ollama&quot;
model = &quot;mistral&quot;
```

This way, you can specify one command-line argument (.e.g., `--profile o3`, `--profile mistral`) to override multiple settings together.

&lt;/details&gt;

Codex can run fully locally against an OpenAI-compatible OSS host (like Ollama) using the `--oss` flag:

- Interactive UI:
  - codex --oss
- Non-interactive (programmatic) mode:
  - echo &quot;Refactor utils&quot; | codex exec --oss

Model selection when using `--oss`:

- If you omit `-m/--model`, Codex defaults to -m gpt-oss:20b and will verify it exists locally (downloading if needed).
- To pick a different size, pass one of:
  - -m &quot;gpt-oss:20b&quot;
  - -m &quot;gpt-oss:120b&quot;

Point Codex at your own OSS host:

- By default, `--oss` talks to http://localhost:11434/v1.
- To use a different host, set one of these environment variables before running Codex:
  - CODEX_OSS_BASE_URL, for example:
    - CODEX_OSS_BASE_URL=&quot;http://my-ollama.example.com:11434/v1&quot; codex --oss -m gpt-oss:20b
  - or CODEX_OSS_PORT (when the host is localhost):
    - CODEX_OSS_PORT=11434 codex --oss

Advanced: you can persist this in your config instead of environment variables by overriding the built-in `oss` provider in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[model_providers.oss]
name = &quot;Open Source&quot;
base_url = &quot;http://my-ollama.example.com:11434/v1&quot;
```

### Platform sandboxing details

The mechanism Codex uses to implement the sandbox policy depends on your OS:

- **macOS 12+** uses **Apple Seatbelt** and runs commands using `sandbox-exec` with a profile (`-p`) that corresponds to the `--sandbox` that was specified.
- **Linux** uses a combination of Landlock/seccomp APIs to enforce the `sandbox` configuration.

Note that when running Linux in a containerized environment such as Docker, sandboxing may not work if the host/container configuration does not support the necessary Landlock/seccomp APIs. In such cases, we recommend configuring your Docker container so that it provides the sandbox guarantees you are looking for and then running `codex` with `--sandbox danger-full-access` (or, more simply, the `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` flag) within your container.

---

## Memory &amp; project docs

You can give Codex extra instructions and guidance using `AGENTS.md` files. Codex looks for `AGENTS.md` files in the following places, and merges them top-down:

1. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` - personal global guidance
2. `AGENTS.md` at repo root - shared project notes
3. `AGENTS.md` in the current working directory - sub-folder/feature specifics

---

## Non-interactive / CI mode

Run Codex head-less in pipelines. Example GitHub Action step:

```yaml
- name: Update changelog via Codex
  run: |
    npm install -g @openai/codex
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}&quot;
    codex exec --full-auto &quot;update CHANGELOG for next release&quot;
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Codex CLI can be configured to leverage MCP servers by defining an [`mcp_servers`](./codex-rs/config.md#mcp_servers) section in `~/.codex/config.toml`. It is intended to mirror how tools such as Claude and Cursor define `mcpServers` in their respective JSON config files, though the Codex format is slightly different since it uses TOML rather than JSON, e.g.:

```toml
# IMPORTANT: the top-level key is `mcp_servers` rather than `mcpServers`.
[mcp_servers.server-name]
command = &quot;npx&quot;
args = [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;mcp-server&quot;]
env = { &quot;API_KEY&quot; = &quot;value&quot; }
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; It is somewhat experimental, but the Codex CLI can also be run as an MCP _server_ via `codex mcp`. If you launch it with an MCP client such as `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector codex mcp` and send it a `tools/list` request, you will see that there is only one tool, `codex`, that accepts a grab-bag of inputs, including a catch-all `config` map for anything you might want to override. Feel free to play around with it and provide feedback via GitHub issues.

## Tracing / verbose logging

Because Codex is written in Rust, it honors the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to configure its logging behavior.

The TUI defaults to `RUST_LOG=codex_core=info,codex_tui=info` and log messages are written to `~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log`, so you can leave the following running in a separate terminal to monitor log messages as they are written:

```
tail -F ~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log
```

By comparison, the non-interactive mode (`codex exec`) defaults to `RUST_LOG=error`, but messages are printed inline, so there is no need to monitor a separate file.

See the Rust documentation on [`RUST_LOG`](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging) for more information on the configuration options.

---

### DotSlash

The GitHub Release also contains a [DotSlash](https://dotslash-cli.com/) file for the Codex CLI named `codex`. Using a DotSlash file makes it possible to make a lightweight commit to source control to ensure all contributors use the same version of an executable, regardless of what platform they use for development.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic —  with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto and Betting, enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

developer/user communities.
However, Python has performance and typing limitations for large-scale, latency-sensitive systems. Cython addresses many of these issues by introducing static typing into Python&#039;s rich ecosystem of libraries and communities.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

**NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** or on demand.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels **ship** in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) is [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) compliant and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

**Note**: Wheels from the `develop` branch are only built for the Linux x86_64 platform to save time
and compute resources, while `nightly` wheels support additional platforms as shown below.

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | -       |

This process also helps preserve compute resources and ensures easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We don&#039;t recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip installs the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212` for December 12, 2024):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.208.0a20241212 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).

To programmatically fetch and list available versions:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP &#039;(?&lt;=&lt;a href=&quot;)[^&quot;]+(?=&quot;)&#039; | awk -F&#039;#&#039; &#039;{print $1}&#039; | sort
```

# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running a local development environment

Neon can be run on a workstation for small experiments and to test code changes, by
following these instructions.

#### Installing dependencies on Linux
1. Install build dependencies and other applicable packages

* On Ubuntu or Debian, this set of packages should be sufficient to build the code:
```bash
apt install build-essential libtool libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libseccomp-dev \
libssl-dev clang pkg-config libpq-dev cmake postgresql-client protobuf-compiler \
libprotobuf-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl python3-poetry lsof libicu-dev
```
* On Fedora, these packages are needed:
```bash
dnf install flex bison readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel \
  libseccomp-devel perl clang cmake postgresql postgresql-contrib protobuf-compiler \
  protobuf-devel libcurl-devel openssl poetry lsof libicu-devel libpq-devel python3-devel \
  libffi-devel
```
* On Arch based systems, these packages are needed:
```bash
pacman -S base-devel readline zlib libseccomp openssl clang \
postgresql-libs cmake postgresql protobuf curl lsof
```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo &#039;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it&#039;s built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project&#039;s directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry&gt;=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data
# Later that would be responsibility of a package install script
&gt; cargo neon init
Initializing pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;

# start pageserver, safekeeper, and broker for their intercommunication
&gt; cargo neon start
Starting neon broker at 127.0.0.1:50051.
storage_broker started, pid: 2918372
Starting pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;.
pageserver started, pid: 2918386
Starting safekeeper at &#039;127.0.0.1:5454&#039; in &#039;.neon/safekeepers/sk1&#039;.
safekeeper 1 started, pid: 2918437

# create initial tenant and use it as a default for every future neon_local invocation
&gt; cargo neon tenant create --set-default
tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c successfully created on the pageserver
Created an initial timeline &#039;de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9&#039; at Lsn 0/16B5A50 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c
Setting tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c as a default one

# create postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create main

# start postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start main
Starting new endpoint main (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres&#039;

# check list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT  ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME  LSN        STATUS
 main      127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main         0/16B5BA8  running
```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
&gt; cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline &#039;b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601&#039; at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: &#039;main&#039;

# check branches tree
&gt; cargo neon timeline list
(L) main [de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9]
(L) ┗━ @0/16F9A00: migration_check [b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601]

# create postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create migration_check --branch-name migration_check

# start postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start migration_check
Starting new endpoint migration_check (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55434/postgres&#039;

# check the new list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT         ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME      LSN        STATUS
 main             127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main             0/16F9A38  running
 migration_check  127.0.0.1:55434  b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601  migration_check  0/16F9A70  running

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from &#039;main&#039; postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
&gt; psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn&#039;t affect the &#039;main&#039; postgres
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
&gt; cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Local Development Control Plane (`neon_local`))](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it&#039;s best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--features=testing&quot; make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=17 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

&gt;[!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
&gt; It&#039;s a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
&gt; See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

- [sourcetree.md](/docs/sourcetree.md) contains overview of source tree layout.

To view your `rustdoc` documentation in a browser, try running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

See also README files in some source directories, and `rustdoc` style documentation comments.

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon&#039;s very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it&#039;s inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **If you want to experience a more powerful AI wrapper application, you can try the Noi (https://github.com/lencx/Noi), which is a successor to the ChatGPT desktop application concept.**

---

This is an unofficial project solely intended for personal learning and research. Since the ChatGPT desktop application was open-sourced, it has garnered a lot of attention, and I want to thank everyone for their support. However, as the project progressed, two issues have arisen that greatly impact its future development:

- Some individuals have repackaged and sold it for profit.
- The name and icon of ChatGPT could potentially lead to infringement disputes.

- Pop-up Search ([#122](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/122) mouse selected content, no more than 400 characters): The application is built using Tauri, and due to its security restrictions, some of the action buttons will not work, so we recommend going to your browser.

## Thanks

- The core implementation of the share button code was copied from the [@liady](https://github.com/liady) extension with some modifications.
- Thanks to the [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) repository for inspiring the custom command function for this application.

RisingWave is a real-time event streaming platform designed to offer the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;simplest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;most cost-effective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; way to &lt;b&gt;process&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;analyze&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;manage&lt;/b&gt; real-time event data — with built-in support for the [Apache Iceberg™](https://iceberg.apache.org/) open table format. It provides both a Postgres-compatible [SQL interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) and a DataFrame-style [Python interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/python-sdk/intro).

RisingWave can &lt;b&gt;ingest&lt;/b&gt; millions of events per second, continuously &lt;b&gt;join and analyze&lt;/b&gt; live streams with historical data, &lt;b&gt;serve&lt;/b&gt; ad-hoc queries at low latency, and &lt;b&gt;persist&lt;/b&gt; fresh, consistent results to Apache Iceberg™ or any other downstream system.

## Try it out in 60 seconds

Install RisingWave standalone mode:
```shell
curl -L https://risingwave.com/sh | sh
```

To learn about other installation options, such as using a Docker image, see [Quick Start](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/get-started/).

## Stream, Store, and Query — All in One

RisingWave delivers a full **end-to-end streaming data platform** — combining real-time processing with built-in storage and open-format persistence.

It supports:

* **Ingestion:** Ingest millions of events per second from streaming and batch sources.
* **Stream processing:** Perform real-time incremental processing to join and analyze live data with historical tables.
* **Delivery:** Deliver fresh, consistent results to data lakes (e.g., Apache Iceberg™) or any destination.

What sets RisingWave apart is its integrated storage engine:

* **Online serving:** Row-based storage optimized for point and range queries with single-digit millisecond latency.
* **Offline persistence:** Built-in Apache Iceberg™ integration for low-cost, durable storage with open access for external query engines.

With RisingWave, real-time data isn’t just processed — it’s stored, queried, and shared across your entire stack.

## Key design decisions

RisingWave is designed to be easier to use and more cost-efficient:

### PostgreSQL compatibility

* **Seamless integration:** Connects via the PostgreSQL wire protocol, working with psql, JDBC, and any Postgres tool.
* **Expressive SQL:** Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data with a familiar SQL dialect.
* **No manual state tuning:** Eliminates complex state management configurations.

### S3 as primary storage

RisingWave stores tables, materialized views, and internal states of stream processing jobs in S3 (or equivalent object storage), providing:
- **High performance:** Optimized for complex queries, including joins and time windowing.
- **Fast recovery:** Restores from system failures within seconds.
- **[Dynamic scaling](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/k8s-cluster-scaling):** Instantly adjusts resources to handle workload spikes.

### Elastic disk cache

Beyond caching hot data in memory, RisingWave supports [**elastic disk cache**](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/disk-cache), a powerful performance optimization that uses local disks or EBS for efficient data caching. This minimizes access to S3, lowering processing latency and cutting S3 access costs.

### Apache Iceberg™ native support
RisingWave [**natively integrates with Apache Iceberg™**](https://docs.risingwave.com/iceberg/overview), enabling continuous ingestion of streaming data into Iceberg tables. It can also read directly from Iceberg, perform automatic compaction, and maintain table health over time. Since Iceberg is an open table format, results are accessible by other query engines — making storage not only cost-efficient, but interoperable by design.

## In what use cases does RisingWave excel?
RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Streaming analytics**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Event-driven applications**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.

## Production deployments

## Repository Structure

The main components of this repository are structured as follows:

  * `core/`: The implementation of `libp2p-core` with its `Transport` and
    `StreamMuxer` API on which almost all other crates depend.

  * `transports/`: Implementations of transport protocols (e.g. TCP) and protocol upgrades
    (e.g. for authenticated encryption, compression, ...) based on the `libp2p-core` `Transport`
    API.

  * `muxers/`: Implementations of the `StreamMuxer` interface of `libp2p-core`,
    e.g. (sub)stream multiplexing protocols on top of (typically TCP) connections.
    Multiplexing protocols are (mandatory) `Transport` upgrades.

  * `swarm/`: The implementation of `libp2p-swarm` building on `libp2p-core`
    with the central interfaces `NetworkBehaviour` and `ConnectionHandler` used
    to implement application protocols (see `protocols/`).

  * `protocols/`: Implementations of application protocols based on the
    `libp2p-swarm` APIs.

  * `misc/`: Utility libraries.

  * `libp2p/examples/`: Worked examples of built-in application protocols (see `protocols/`)
    with common `Transport` configurations.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Troubleshooting

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;See details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that may arise are likely due to your system missing dependencies
required to correctly analyze a network adapter. &lt;br&gt;
Check the [required dependencies page](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Required-dependencies) 
for instructions on how to proceed depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not updated,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may manifest bugs (the interface glitches, color gradients are unsupported, or some icons are completely black). &lt;br&gt;
In these cases you can set an environment variable to switch to the `tiny-skia` renderer,
a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment:

```sh
ICED_BACKEND=tiny-skia
```

### ***In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/new/choose), and I will do my best to help you!***

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## Latest News

* [08/05] Deploy `openai/gpt-oss-120b` with disaggregated serving on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs using Dynamo [➡️ link](./components/backends/trtllm/gpt-oss.md)

## The Era of Multi-GPU, Multi-Node

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models are quickly outgrowing the memory and compute budget of any single GPU. Tensor-parallelism solves the capacity problem by spreading each layer across many GPUs—and sometimes many servers—but it creates a new one: how do you coordinate those shards, route requests, and share KV cache fast enough to feel like one accelerator? This orchestration gap is exactly what NVIDIA Dynamo is built to close.

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:

- **Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference** – Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.
- **Dynamic GPU scheduling** – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-aware request routing** – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated data transfer** – Reduces inference response time using NIXL.
- **KV cache offloading** – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.

# Installation

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/support_matrix.md](docs/support_matrix.md)

## 1. Initial setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install etcd and NATS (required)

To coordinate across a data center, Dynamo relies on etcd and NATS. To run Dynamo locally, these need to be available.

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs jetstream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup etcd &amp; NATS, you can also run:
```
# At the root of the repository:
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 2. Select an engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, trtllm, and llama.cpp. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Running an LLM API server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server, a pre-processor (prompt templating and tokenization) and a router:
python -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8080

# Start the SGLang engine, connecting to NATS and etcd to receive requests. You can run several of these,
# both for the same model and for multiple models. The frontend node will discover them.
python -m dynamo.sglang.worker --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B --skip-tokenizer-init
```

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### Deploying Dynamo

- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/README.md) to deploy on Kubernetes.
- Check out [Backends](components/backends) to deploy various workflow configurations (e.g. SGLang with router, vLLM with disaggregated serving, etc.)
- Run some [Examples](examples) to learn about building components in Dynamo and exploring various integrations.

# Engines

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic. To use any engine with Dynamo, NATS and etcd need to be installed, along with a Dynamo frontend (`python -m dynamo.frontend [--interactive]`).

## vLLM

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

vLLM attempts to allocate enough KV cache for the full context length at startup. If that does not fit in your available memory pass `--context-length &lt;value&gt;`.

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

## SGLang

```
# Install libnuma
apt install -y libnuma-dev

uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.sglang.worker --help
```

You can pass any sglang flags directly to this worker, see https://docs.sglang.ai/backend/server_arguments.html . See there to use multiple GPUs.

## TensorRT-LLM

It is recommended to use [NGC PyTorch Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for running the TensorRT-LLM engine.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Ensure that you select a PyTorch container image version that matches the version of TensorRT-LLM you are using.
&gt; For example, if you are using `tensorrt-llm==1.0.0rc4`, use the PyTorch container image version `25.05`.
&gt; To find the correct PyTorch container version for your desired `tensorrt-llm` release, visit the [TensorRT-LLM Dockerfile.multi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.multi) on GitHub. Switch to the branch that matches your `tensorrt-llm` version, and look for the `BASE_TAG` line to identify the recommended PyTorch container tag.

&gt; [!Important]
&gt; Launch container with the following additional settings `--shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1`

### Install prerequisites
```
# Optional step: Only required for Blackwell and Grace Hopper
pip3 install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

sudo apt-get -y install libopenmpi-dev
```

&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; You can learn more about these prequisites and known issues with TensorRT-LLM pip based installation [here](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html).

### After installing the pre-requisites above, install Dynamo
```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[trtllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.trtllm --help
```

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

# Developing Locally

## 1. Install libraries

**Ubuntu:**
```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
```
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```
If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.


## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python virtual env:

```
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install build tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install the wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install .
# For development, use
export PYTHONPATH=&quot;${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/components/frontend/src:$(pwd)/components/planner/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/vllm/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/sglang/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/trtllm/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/llama_cpp/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/mocker/src&quot;
```

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Editable (`-e`) does not work because the `dynamo` package is split over multiple directories, one per backend.

You should now be able to run `python -m dynamo.frontend`.

Remember that nats and etcd must be running (see earlier).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.

Revm is a highly efficient and stable implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) written in Rust.

![banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluealloy/revm/refs/heads/main/assets/logo/revm-banner.png)

[mit-license]: https://opensource.org/license/mit/
[gh-ci]: https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/actions/workflows/ci.yml
[tg-url]: https://t.me/+Ig4WDWOzikA3MzA0
[tg-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-telegram-blue

Known for its robustness, it stands as one of the most popular libraries and a critical component of the Ethereum ecosystem. Revm plays a crucial role across various projects, being widely utilized by almost all tooling and block builders. It is integrated into Reth, multiple Layer 2 variants and other clients and serving as a standard for zkVMs.

Revm offers two primary applications: firstly, it functions as an executor where users can set up block info and process mainnet transactions; secondly, it acts as a framework that facilitates the extension and support of different EVM variants such as op-revm.

### How to use:

Here is a straightforward example of using the Execution API: It allows us to create an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and execute transactions. Additionally, it can be utilized to generate traces with the inspector or more complex example of foundry cheatcodes.

```rust,ignore
let mut evm = Context::mainnet().with_block(block).build_mainnet();
let out = evm.transact(tx);

// or you can use powerful inspection tool to trace it
let mut evm = evm.with_inspector(tracer);
let out = evm.inspect_tx(tx);
```

The Evm Framework API is somewhat complex to use, but this document provides a detailed explanation. It enables users to extend logic, incorporate various context types, and offers built-in support for inspection. For a practical example, you can refer to the [op-revm crate](https://github.com/op-rs/op-revm).

### Users:

As previously noted, there are several groups of projects that utilize this technology:

* **Major block builders**.
* **Clients**: [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), [Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios), [Trin](https://github.com/ethereum/trin),..
* **Tooling**: [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/), [Hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat),..
* **L2s**: [Optimism](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/tree/main/crates/op-revm), [Coinbase](https://www.base.org/), [Scroll](https://github.com/scroll-tech/revm),..
* **zkVM**: [Risc0](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum), [Succinct](https://github.com/succinctlabs/rsp),..

The full list of projects that use Revm is available in the [awesome-revm](https://bluealloy.github.io/revm/awesome.html) section of the book.

### How to, dev section

The [book](https://bluealloy.github.io/revm/) and [`Architecture and API`](https://bluealloy.github.io/revm/architecture.html) page is the best starting resource.

Some quick links can be found here. Some point to code documentation or the book. code docs are there to explain usage of a particular part of the code where the book is to get more of an overview of the architecture or how components/projects fit together.

## About

This library implements constrained decoding (also called constrained sampling or
structured outputs) for Large Langauge Models (LLMs).
It can enforce arbitrary context-free grammar on the output of LLM
and is fast - on the order of 50μs of CPU time per token
(for 128k tokenizer) with negligible startup costs.

Following grammar formats are supported:
- [a large subset](./docs/json_schema.md) of JSON schemas
- regular expressions
- context-free grammars in a [variation of Lark format](./docs/syntax.md);
  with embedded JSON schemas and regular expressions
- `llguidance` - [internal (JSON-based) format](./parser/src/api.rs);
  slowly being deprecated in favor of the Lark-like format

The internal format is most powerful (though Lark-like format is catching up, and there are plans to convert the libraries to use it) and can be generated by the following libraries:
- [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) (Python)
- [guidance.ts](https://github.com/mmoskal/guidance-ts) (TypeScript)
- hopefully more to come!

The library can be used from:
- [Rust](./parser/README.md), [sample](./sample_parser/src/minimal.rs)
- [C and C++](./parser/llguidance.h), [sample](./c_sample/c_sample.cpp)
- [Python](./python/llguidance/_lib.pyi)

## Integrations

The library is currently integrated in:
- [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) - library for interacting with LLMs
- [OpenAI models](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1924915343677653014) - LLGuidance powers [Structured Output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) (JSON Schema only)
- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/10224) - 
  available via `-DLLAMA_LLGUIDANCE=ON` option for `cmake`;
  llama.cpp can be also used Guidance Python package
- **Chromium** - [merged](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/07ca6337c2f714ba0477202414bd2b1692e70594),
  to be used for [JSON Schema enforcement](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/prompt-api?tab=readme-ov-file#structured-output-or-json-output) for `window.ai` in Chromium-based browsers
- [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/3298) -
  use `--grammar-backend llguidance`; when passing Lark grammar make
  sure to prefix them with `%llguidance {}`, just as in llama.cpp
- **vLLM** - [V0 PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/14589) and [V1 PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/14779)

## Technical details

See [Making Structured Outputs Go Brrr](https://guidance-ai.github.io/llguidance/llg-go-brrr) for an overview of the library,
including the design decisions, performance, and how it compares to other approaches.

Given a context-free grammar, a tokenizer, and a prefix of tokens, llguidance computes a token mask - a set of tokens from the tokenizer - that, when added to the current token prefix, can lead to a valid string in the language defined by the grammar. Mask computation takes approximately 50μs of single-core CPU time for a tokenizer with 128k tokens. While this timing depends on the exact grammar, it holds, for example, for grammars derived from JSON schemas. There is no significant startup cost.

The library implements a context-free grammar parser using Earley’s algorithm on top of a lexer based on [derivatives of regular expressions](https://github.com/microsoft/derivre). Mask computation is achieved by traversing the [prefix tree (trie)](./docs/toktrie.md) of all possible tokens, leveraging [highly optimized](./docs/optimizations.md) code.

Grammars can be also used to speed up decode via [fast-forward tokens](./docs/fast_forward.md).

### Comparison and performance

See [MaskBench](https://github.com/guidance-ai/jsonschemabench/tree/main/maskbench) in
[JSON Schema Bench](https://github.com/guidance-ai/jsonschemabench) for detailed performance comparisons.

[LM-format-enforcer](https://github.com/noamgat/lm-format-enforcer) and [llama.cpp grammars](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/grammars/README.md) are similar to llguidance in that they dynamically build token masks for every step of the decoding process. Both are significantly slower - the former due to clean Python code and the latter due to the lack of a lexer and use of a backtracking parser, which, while elegant, is inefficient.

[Outlines](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines) builds an automaton from constraints and then pre-computes token masks for all automaton states, potentially making sampling fast but inherently limiting constraint complexity and introducing significant startup cost and memory overhead. Llguidance computes token masks on the fly and has essentially no startup cost. The lexer’s automata in llguidance are built lazily and are typically much smaller, as the context-free grammar imposes the top-level structure.

[XGrammar](https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar) follows an approach similar to llama.cpp (explicit stack-based, character-level parser) with additional pre-computation of certain token masks, similar to Outlines. The pre-computation often runs into seconds, and sometimes minutes. If the pre-computation works well for a given input, the masks are computed quickly (under 8μs in half of masks we tested), however if it doesn&#039;t fit the particular input, 
the mask computation times can run to tens or hundreds of milliseconds.

In llguidance, the full mask computation for a typical JSON schema takes about 1.5ms (for 128k tokenizer).
However, very often the [&quot;slicer&quot; optimization](./docs/optimizations.md#slicer-optimization) applies,
and thus the avarage mask computation in [JSON Schema Bench](https://github.com/guidance-ai/jsonschemabench)
(2.5M tokens, 10k schemas) is under 50μs,
with less than 1% of masks taking longer than 1ms,
and 0.001% taking longer than 10ms (but still shorter than 30ms).
The optimization doesn&#039;t involve any significant pre-computation.

Thus, with 16 cores and a 10ms forward pass, llguidance can handle batch sizes up to 3200 without slowing down the model. (Note that a 10ms forward pass for small batch sizes typically increases to 20ms+ for batch sizes of 100-200.)

## Building

- [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install); 1.75 or later

If you just need the C or Rust library (`llguidance`), 
check the [parser](./parser/README.md) directory.

For Python bindings:

- install python 3.9 or later; very likely you&#039;ll need a virtual env/conda
- run `./scripts/install-deps.sh`
- to build and after any changes, run `./scripts/test-guidance.sh`

This builds the Python bindings for the library and runs the tests
(which mostly live in the Guidance repo - it will clone it).

Note: previously the [`object_store`] crate was also part of this repository,
but it has been moved to the [arrow-rs-object-store repository]

## Release Versioning and Schedule

The Arrow Rust project releases approximately monthly and follows [Semantic
Versioning].

Due to available maintainer and testing bandwidth, [`arrow`] crates ([`arrow`],
[`arrow-flight`], etc.) are released on the same schedule with the same versions
as the [`parquet`] and [`parquet-derive`] crates.

This crate releases every month. We release new major versions (with potentially
breaking API changes) at most once a quarter, and release incremental minor
versions in the intervening months. See [ticket #5368] for more details.

To keep our maintenance burden down, we do regularly scheduled releases (major
and minor) from the `main` branch. How we handle PRs with breaking API changes
is described in the [contributing] guide.

### Rust Version Compatibility Policy

arrow-rs and parquet are built and tested with stable Rust, and will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) that can only be updated in major releases on a need by basis (e.g. project dependencies bump their MSRV or a particular Rust feature is useful for us etc.). The new MSRV if selected will be at least 6 months old. The minor releases are guaranteed to have the same MSRV.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

### Guidelines for `panic` vs `Result`

In general, use panics for bad states that are unreachable, unrecoverable or harmful.
For those caused by invalid user input, however, we prefer to report that invalidity
gracefully as an error result instead of panicking. In general, invalid input should result
in an `Error` as soon as possible. It _is_ ok for code paths after validation to assume
validation has already occurred and panic if not. See [ticket #6737] for more nuances.

[ticket #6737]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/6737

### Deprecation Guidelines

Minor releases may deprecate, but not remove APIs. Deprecating APIs allows
downstream Rust programs to still compile, but generate compiler warnings. This
gives downstream crates time to migrate prior to API removal.

To deprecate an API:

- Mark the API as deprecated using `#[deprecated]` and specify the exact arrow-rs version in which it was deprecated
- Concisely describe the preferred API to help the user transition

The deprecated version is the next version which will be released (please
consult the list above). To mark the API as deprecated, use the
`#[deprecated(since = &quot;...&quot;, note = &quot;...&quot;)]` attribute.

For example

```rust
#[deprecated(since = &quot;51.0.0&quot;, note = &quot;Use `date_part` instead&quot;)]
```

In general, deprecated APIs will remain in the codebase for at least two major releases after
they were deprecated (typically between 6 - 9 months later). For example, an API
deprecated in `51.3.0` can be removed in `54.0.0` (or later). Deprecated APIs
may be removed earlier or later than these guidelines at the discretion of the
maintainers.

[object_store-readme]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs-object-store/blob/main/README.md

Collectively, these crates support a wider array of functionality for analytic computations in Rust.

For example, you can write SQL queries or a `DataFrame` (using the
[`datafusion`] crate) to read a parquet file (using the [`parquet`] crate),
evaluate it in-memory using Arrow&#039;s columnar format (using the [`arrow`] crate),
and send to another process (using the [`arrow-flight`] crate).

Generally speaking, the [`arrow`] crate offers functionality for using Arrow
arrays, and [`datafusion`] offers most operations typically found in SQL,
including `join`s and window functions.

You can find more details about each crate in their respective READMEs.

## Arrow Rust Community

The `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list serves as the core communication channel for the Arrow community. Instructions for signing up and links to the archives can be found on the [Arrow Community](https://arrow.apache.org/community/) page. All major announcements and communications happen there.

The Rust Arrow community also uses the official [ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) for informal discussions and coordination. This is
a great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to contribute. Join us in the `#arrow-rust` channel and feel free to ask for an invite via:

1. the `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list
2. the [GitHub Discussions][discussions]
3. the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YAb2TdazKQ)

The Rust implementation uses [GitHub issues][issues] as the system of record for new features and bug fixes and
this plays a critical role in the release process.

For design discussions we generally use GitHub issues.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Embassy

Embassy is the next-generation framework for embedded applications. Write safe, correct, and energy-efficient embedded code faster, using the Rust programming language, its async facilities, and the Embassy libraries.

## [Documentation](https://embassy.dev/book/index.html) - [API reference](https://docs.embassy.dev/) - [Website](https://embassy.dev/) - [Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#embassy-rs:matrix.org)

## Rust + async ❤️ embedded

The Rust programming language is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime, garbage collector, or OS. It catches a wide variety of bugs at compile time, thanks to its full memory- and thread-safety, and expressive type system.

Rust&#039;s [async/await](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/) allows for unprecedentedly easy and efficient multitasking in embedded systems. Tasks get transformed at compile time into state machines that get run cooperatively. It requires no dynamic memory allocation and runs on a single stack, so no per-task stack size tuning is required. It obsoletes the need for a traditional RTOS with kernel context switching, and is [faster and smaller than one!](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown)

## Batteries included

- **Hardware Abstraction Layers**
    - HALs implement safe, idiomatic Rust APIs to use the hardware capabilities, so raw register manipulation is not needed. The Embassy project maintains HALs for select hardware, but you can still use HALs from other projects with Embassy.
    - [embassy-stm32](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/), for all STM32 microcontroller families.
    - [embassy-nrf](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-nrf/), for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF54 and nRF91 series.
    - [embassy-rp](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/), for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP23xx microcontrollers.
    - [embassy-mspm0](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-mspm0/), for the Texas Instruments MSPM0 microcontrollers.
    - [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs), for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of chips.
        - Embassy HAL support for Espressif chips, as well as Async Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ESP-NOW, is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repository.
    - [ch32-hal](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal), for the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series of chips.
    - [mpfs-hal](https://github.com/AlexCharlton/mpfs-hal), for the Microchip PolarFire SoC.
    - [py32-hal](https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-hal), for the Puya Semiconductor PY32 series of microcontrollers.

- **Time that Just Works** -
  No more messing with hardware timers. [embassy_time](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time) provides Instant, Duration, and Timer types that are globally available and never overflow.

- **Real-time ready** -
  Tasks on the same async executor run cooperatively, but you can create multiple executors with different priorities so that higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones. See the [example](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/master/examples/nrf52840/src/bin/multiprio.rs).

- **Low-power ready** -
  Easily build devices with years of battery life. The async executor automatically puts the core to sleep when there&#039;s no work to do. Tasks are woken by interrupts, there is no busy-loop polling while waiting.

- **Networking** -
  The [embassy-net](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/) network stack implements extensive networking functionality, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and DHCP. Async drastically simplifies managing timeouts and serving multiple connections concurrently.

- **Bluetooth**
    - The [trouble](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble) crate provides a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x Host that runs on any microcontroller implementing the [bt-hci](https://github.com/embassy-rs/bt-hci) traits (currently
      `nRF52`, `rp2040`, `rp23xx` and `esp32` and `serial` controllers are supported).
    - The [nrf-softdevice](https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice) crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x support for nRF52 microcontrollers.
    - The [embassy-stm32-wpan](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-stm32-wpan) crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 5.x support for stm32wb microcontrollers.

- **LoRa** -
  The [lora-rs](https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs) project provides an async LoRa and LoRaWAN stack that works well on Embassy.

- **USB** -
  [embassy-usb](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-usb/) implements a device-side USB stack. Implementations for common classes such as USB serial (CDC ACM) and USB HID are available, and a rich builder API allows building your own.

- **Bootloader and DFU** -
  [embassy-boot](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/master/embassy-boot) is a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks.

## Sneak peek

```rust,ignore
use defmt::info;
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_time::{Duration, Timer};
use embassy_nrf::gpio::{AnyPin, Input, Level, Output, OutputDrive, Pin, Pull};
use embassy_nrf::{Peri, Peripherals};

// Declare async tasks
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn blink(pin: Peri&lt;&#039;static, AnyPin&gt;) {
    let mut led = Output::new(pin, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard);

    loop {
        // Timekeeping is globally available, no need to mess with hardware timers.
        led.set_high();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
        led.set_low();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
    }
}

// Main is itself an async task as well.
#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());

    // Spawned tasks run in the background, concurrently.
    spawner.spawn(blink(p.P0_13.into())).unwrap();

    let mut button = Input::new(p.P0_11, Pull::Up);
    loop {
        // Asynchronously wait for GPIO events, allowing other tasks
        // to run, or the core to sleep.
        button.wait_for_low().await;
        info!(&quot;Button pressed!&quot;);
        button.wait_for_high().await;
        info!(&quot;Button released!&quot;);
    }
}
```

## Examples

Examples are found in the
`examples/` folder separated by the chip manufacturer they are designed to run on. For example:

* `examples/nrf52840` run on the
  `nrf52840-dk` board (PCA10056) but should be easily adaptable to other nRF52 chips and boards.
* `examples/nrf5340` run on the `nrf5340-dk` board (PCA10095).
* `examples/stm32xx` for the various STM32 families.
* `examples/rp` are for the RP2040 chip.
* `examples/std` are designed to run locally on your PC.

### Running examples

- Install `probe-rs` following the instructions at &lt;https://probe.rs&gt;.
- Change directory to the sample&#039;s base directory. For example:

```bash
cd examples/nrf52840
```

- Ensure `Cargo.toml` sets the right feature for the name of the chip you are programming.
  If this name is incorrect, the example may fail to run or immediately crash
  after being programmed.

- Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` contains the name of the chip you are programming.

- Run the example

For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin blinky
```

For more help getting started, see [Getting Started][1] and [Running the Examples][2].

## Developing Embassy with Rust Analyzer-based editors

The [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is used by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and others. Given the multiple targets that Embassy serves, there is no Cargo workspace file. Instead, the Rust Analyzer
must be told of the target project to work with. In the case of Visual Studio Code,
please refer to the `.vscode/settings.json` file&#039;s `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects`setting.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

Embassy is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.75 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions, but that may change in any new patch release.

## Why the name?

EMBedded ASYnc! :)

## License

Embassy is licensed under either of

- Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or
  &lt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&gt;)
- MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;)

at your option.

## Prerequisites

See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for software requirements to develop in this repo.

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX

# Set the path of the future wallet.
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[1]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[1]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;
```

More complex examples may be found in our [developer manual](https://linera.dev) as well

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

Zellij includes a built-in [web-client](https://zellij.dev/tutorials/web-client/), making a terminal optional.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

These are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: الزليج, romanized: zillīj; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [📖 Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

You can find additional [setup and configurations guides](https://getfoundry.sh/config/overview) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs] and in the [config crate](./crates/config/README.md):

## What&#039;s Kona?

Originally a suite of portable implementations of the OP Stack rollup state transition,
Kona has been extended to be _the monorepo_ for &lt;a href=&quot;https://specs.optimism.io/&quot;&gt;OP Stack&lt;/a&gt;
types, components, and services built in Rust. Kona provides an ecosystem of extensible, low-level
crates that compose into components and services required for the OP Stack.

The [docs][site] contains a more in-depth overview of the project, contributor guidelines, tutorials for
getting started with building your own programs, and a reference for the libraries and tools provided by Kona.

## Overview

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Ethereum (Alloy) types modified for the OP Stack live in [op-alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy).

**Binaries**

- [`client`](./bin/client): The bare-metal program that executes the state transition, to be ran on a prover.
- [`host`](./bin/host): The host program that runs natively alongside the prover, serving as the [Preimage Oracle][g-preimage-oracle] server.
- [`node`](./bin/node): [WIP] A [Rollup Node][rollup-node-spec] implementation, backed by [`kona-derive`](./crates/protocol/derive). Supports flexible chain ID specification via `--l2-chain-id` using either numeric IDs (`10`) or chain names (`optimism`).
- [`supervisor`](./bin/supervisor): [WIP] A [Supervisor][supervisor-spec] implementation.

**Protocol**

- [`genesis`](./crates/protocol/genesis): Genesis types for OP Stack chains.
- [`protocol`](./crates/protocol/protocol): Core protocol types used across OP Stack rust crates.
- [`derive`](./crates/protocol/derive): `no_std` compatible implementation of the [derivation pipeline][g-derivation-pipeline].
- [`driver`](./crates/proof/driver): Stateful derivation pipeline driver.
- [`interop`](./crates/protocol/interop): Core functionality and primitives for the [Interop feature](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/overview.html) of the OP Stack.
- [`registry`](./crates/protocol/registry): Rust bindings for the [superchain-registry][superchain-registry].
- [`comp`](./crates/protocol/comp): Compression types for the OP Stack.
- [`hardforks`](./crates/protocol/hardforks): Consensus layer hardfork types for the OP Stack including network upgrade transactions.

**Proof**

- [`mpt`](./crates/proof/mpt): Utilities for interacting with the Merkle Patricia Trie in the client program.
- [`executor`](./crates/proof/executor): `no_std` stateless block executor for the [OP Stack][op-stack].
- [`proof`](./crates/proof/proof): High level OP Stack state transition proof SDK.
- [`proof-interop`](./crates/proof/proof-interop): Extension of `kona-proof` with interop support.
- [`preimage`](./crates/proof/preimage): High level interfaces to the [`PreimageOracle`][fpp-specs] ABI.
- [`std-fpvm`](./crates/proof/std-fpvm): Platform specific [Fault Proof VM][g-fault-proof-vm] kernel APIs.
- [`std-fpvm-proc`](./crates/proof/std-fpvm-proc): Proc macro for [Fault Proof Program][fpp-specs] entrypoints.

**Node**

- [`service`](./crates/node/service): The OP Stack rollup node service.
- [`engine`](./crates/node/engine): An extensible implementation of the [OP Stack][op-stack] rollup node engine client
- [`rpc`](./crates/node/rpc): OP Stack RPC types and extensions.
- [`p2p`](./crates/node/p2p): OP Stack P2P Networking including Gossip and Discovery.
- [`sources`](./crates/node/sources): Data source types and utilities for the kona-node.

**Providers**

- [`providers-alloy`](./crates/providers/providers-alloy): Provider implementations for `kona-derive` backed by [Alloy][alloy].

**Utilities**

- [`serde`](./crates/utilities/serde): Serialization helpers.
- [`cli`](./crates/utilities/cli): Standard CLI utilities, used across `kona`&#039;s binaries.
- [`macros`](./crates/utilities/macros): Utility macros.

### Proof

Built on top of these libraries, this repository also features a [proof program][fpp-specs]
designed to deterministically execute the rollup state transition in order to verify an
[L2 output root][g-output-root] from the L1 inputs it was [derived from][g-derivation-pipeline].

Kona&#039;s libraries were built with alternative backend support and extensibility in mind - the repository features
a fault proof virtual machine backend for use in the governance-approved OP Stack, but it&#039;s portable across
provers! Kona is also used by:

- [`op-succinct`][op-succinct]
- [`kailua`][kailua]

To build your own backend for kona, or build a new application on top of its libraries,
see the [SDK section of the docs](https://rollup.yoga/node/design/intro).

## MSRV

The current MSRV (minimum supported rust version) is `1.88`.

The MSRV is not increased automatically, and will be updated
only as part of a patch (pre-1.0) or minor (post-1.0) release.


## Crate Releases

`kona` releases are done using the [`cargo-release`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-release) crate.
A detailed guide is available in [./RELEASES.md](./RELEASES.md).


## Contributing

`kona` is built by open source contributors like you, thank you for improving the project!

A [contributing guide][contributing] is available that sets guidelines for contributing.

Pull requests will not be merged unless CI passes, so please ensure that your contribution
follows the linting rules and passes clippy.


## Credits

`kona` is inspired by the work of several teams, namely [OP Labs][op-labs] and other contributors&#039; work on the
[Optimism monorepo][op-go-monorepo] and [BadBoiLabs][bad-boi-labs]&#039;s work on [Cannon-rs][badboi-cannon-rs].

`kona` is also built on rust types in [alloy][alloy], [op-alloy][op-alloy], and [maili][maili].

Relay is a JavaScript framework for building data-driven React applications.

* **Declarative:** Never again communicate with your data store using an imperative API. Simply declare your data requirements using GraphQL and let Relay figure out how and when to fetch your data.
* **Colocation:** Queries live next to the views that rely on them, so you can easily reason about your app. Relay aggregates queries into efficient network requests to fetch only what you need.
* **Mutations:** Relay lets you mutate data on the client and server using GraphQL mutations, and offers automatic data consistency, optimistic updates, and error handling.

[See how to use Relay in your own project](https://relay.dev/docs/en/introduction-to-relay).

## Example

The [relay-examples](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples) repository contains an implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). To try it out:

```
git clone https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples.git
cd relay-examples/todo
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

Then, just point your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contribute

We actively welcome pull requests, learn how to [contribute](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Users

We have a [community-maintained list](https://relay.dev/users/) of people and projects using Relay in production.

## License

Relay is [MIT licensed](./LICENSE).

## Thanks

We&#039;d like to thank [the contributors](https://github.com/facebook/relay/graphs/contributors) that helped make Relay in open source possible.

The open source project [`relay-hooks`](https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-hooks) allowed the community to experiment with Relay and React Hooks, and was a source of valuable feedback for us. The idea for the `useSubscription` hook originated in [an issue](https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-hooks/issues/5#issuecomment-603930570) on that repo. Thank you [@morrys](https://github.com/morrys) for driving this project and for playing such an important role in our open source community.

Thank you for helping make this possible!

2. Dynamic

    Built upon [SeaQuery](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query), SeaORM allows you to build complex dynamic queries.

3. Service Oriented

    Quickly build services that join, filter, sort and paginate data in REST, GraphQL and gRPC APIs.

4. Production Ready

    SeaORM is feature-rich, well-tested and used in production by companies and startups.

## A quick taste of SeaORM

### Entity
```rust
use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = &quot;cake&quot;)]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DeriveRelation)]
pub enum Relation {
    #[sea_orm(has_many = &quot;super::fruit::Entity&quot;)]
    Fruit,
}

impl Related&lt;super::fruit::Entity&gt; for Entity {
    fn to() -&gt; RelationDef {
        Relation::Fruit.def()
    }
}
```

### Select
```rust
// find all models
let cakes: Vec&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find().all(db).await?;

// find and filter
let chocolate: Vec&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find()
    .filter(cake::Column::Name.contains(&quot;chocolate&quot;))
    .all(db)
    .await?;

// find one model
let cheese: Option&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let cheese: cake::Model = cheese.unwrap();

// find related models (lazy)
let fruits: Vec&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = cheese.find_related(Fruit).all(db).await?;

// find related models (eager)
let cake_with_fruits: Vec&lt;(cake::Model, Vec&lt;fruit::Model&gt;)&gt; =
    Cake::find().find_with_related(Fruit).all(db).await?;
```

### Nested Select

```rust
use sea_orm::DerivePartialModel;

#[derive(DerivePartialModel)]
#[sea_orm(entity = &quot;cake::Entity&quot;)]
struct CakeWithFruit {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    #[sea_orm(nested)]
    fruit: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt;,
}

let cakes: Vec&lt;CakeWithFruit&gt; = cake::Entity::find()
    .left_join(fruit::Entity)
    .into_partial_model()
    .all(db)
    .await?;
```

### Insert
```rust
let apple = fruit::ActiveModel {
    name: Set(&quot;Apple&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default() // no need to set primary key
};

let pear = fruit::ActiveModel {
    name: Set(&quot;Pear&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default()
};

// insert one
let pear = pear.insert(db).await?;

// insert many returning last insert id
let result = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear]).exec(db).await?;
result.last_insert_id == Some(2);
```

### Insert (advanced)
```rust
// insert many with returning (if supported by database)
let models: Vec&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear])
    .exec_with_returning(db)
    .await?;
models[0]
    == fruit::Model {
        id: 1,
        name: &quot;Apple&quot;.to_owned(),
        cake_id: None,
    };

// insert with ON CONFLICT on primary key do nothing, with MySQL specific polyfill
let result = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear])
    .on_conflict_do_nothing()
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

matches!(result, TryInsertResult::Conflicted);
```

### Update
```rust
use sea_orm::sea_query::{Expr, Value};

let pear: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let mut pear: fruit::ActiveModel = pear.unwrap().into();

pear.name = Set(&quot;Sweet pear&quot;.to_owned());

// update one
let pear: fruit::Model = pear.update(db).await?;

// update many: UPDATE &quot;fruit&quot; SET &quot;cake_id&quot; = NULL WHERE &quot;fruit&quot;.&quot;name&quot; LIKE &#039;%Apple%&#039;
Fruit::update_many()
    .col_expr(fruit::Column::CakeId, Expr::value(Value::Int(None)))
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains(&quot;Apple&quot;))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

```
### Save
```rust
let banana = fruit::ActiveModel {
    id: NotSet,
    name: Set(&quot;Banana&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default()
};

// create, because primary key `id` is `NotSet`
let mut banana = banana.save(db).await?;

banana.name = Set(&quot;Banana Mongo&quot;.to_owned());

// update, because primary key `id` is `Set`
let banana = banana.save(db).await?;

```
### Delete
```rust
// delete one
let orange: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let orange: fruit::Model = orange.unwrap();
fruit::Entity::delete(orange.into_active_model())
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

// or simply
let orange: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let orange: fruit::Model = orange.unwrap();
orange.delete(db).await?;

// delete many: DELETE FROM &quot;fruit&quot; WHERE &quot;fruit&quot;.&quot;name&quot; LIKE &#039;Orange&#039;
fruit::Entity::delete_many()
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains(&quot;Orange&quot;))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

```
