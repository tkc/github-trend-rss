## What&#039;s NativeLink?

NativeLink is an efficient, high-performance build cache and remote execution system that accelerates software compilation and testing while reducing infrastructure costs. It optimizes build processes for projects of all sizes by intelligently caching build artifacts and distributing tasks across multiple machines.

NativeLink is trusted in production environments to reduce costs and developer iteration times--handling over **one billion requests** per month for its customers, including large corporations such as **Samsung**.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLpqFuyLMUQ&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://trace-github-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/harper-90-thumbnail.webp&quot; alt=&quot;NativeLink Explained in 90 seconds&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## üîë Key Features

1. **Advanced Build Cache**:
   - Stores and reuses results of previous build steps for unchanged components
   - Significantly reduces build times, especially for incremental changes

2. **Efficient Remote Execution**:
   - Distributes build and test tasks across a network of machines
   - Parallelizes workloads for faster completion
   - Utilizes remote resources to offload computational burden from local machines
   - Ensures consistency with a uniform, controlled build environment

NativeLink seamlessly integrates with build tools that use the Remote Execution protocol, such as [Bazel](https://bazel.build), [Buck2](https://buck2.build), [Goma](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/), and [Reclient](https://github.com/bazelbuild/reclient). It supports Unix-based operating systems and Windows, ensuring broad compatibility across different development environments.

## üöÄ Quickstart

To start, you can deploy NativeLink as a Docker image (as shown below) or by using our cloud-hosted solution, [NativeLink Cloud](https://app.nativelink.com). It&#039;s **FREE** for individuals, open-source projects, and cloud production environments, with support for unlimited team members.

The setups below are **production-grade** installations. See the [contribution docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix/) for instructions on how to build from source with [Bazel](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/bazel/), [Cargo](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/cargo/), and [Nix](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix/).

You can find a few example deployments in the [Docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/deployment-examples/kubernetes).

### üì¶ Prebuilt images

Fast to spin up, but currently limited to `x86_64` systems. See the [container
registry](https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/pkgs/container/nativelink)
for all image tags and the [contribution docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix)
for how to build the images yourself.

**Linux x86_64**

```bash
curl -O \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5

# See https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/pkgs/container/nativelink
# to find the latest tag
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/basic_cas.json5:/config \
    -p 50051:50051 \
    ghcr.io/tracemachina/nativelink:v0.6.0 \
    config
```

**Windows x86_64**

```powershell
# Download the configuration file
Invoke-WebRequest `
    -Uri &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5&quot; `
    -OutFile &quot;basic_cas.json5&quot;

# Run the Docker container
# Note: Adjust the path if the script is not run from the directory containing basic_cas.json
docker run `
    -v ${PWD}/basic_cas.json5:/config `
    -p 50051:50051 `
    ghcr.io/tracemachina/nativelink:v0.6.0 `
    config
```

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Raw executable with Nix

Slower, since it&#039;s built from source, but more flexible and supports MacOS.
Doesn&#039;t support native Windows, but works in WSL2.

Make sure your Nix version is recent and supports flakes. For instance, install
it via the [next-gen nix installer](https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer).

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Executables built for MacOS are dynamically linked against libraries from Nix
&gt; and won&#039;t work on systems that don&#039;t have these libraries present.

**Linux, MacOS, WSL2**

```bash
curl -O \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5

nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink ./basic_cas.json5
```

See the [contribution docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix) for further information.

**eza** is a modern alternative for the venerable file-listing command-line program `ls` that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it‚Äôs **small**, **fast**, and just **one single binary**.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, eza attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of `ls`.

---

**eza** features not in exa (non-exhaustive):

- Fixes [‚ÄúThe Grid Bug‚Äù](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/issues/66#issuecomment-1656758327) introduced in exa 2021.
- Hyperlink support.
- Mount point details.
- Selinux context output.
- Git repo status output.
- Human readable relative dates.
- Several security fixes.
- Support for `bright` terminal colours.
- Many smaller bug fixes/changes!
- Configuration `theme.yml` file for customization of colors and icons.

...and like, so much more that it became exhausting to update this all the time.
Like seriously, we have a lot of good stuff.

---

&lt;a id=&quot;try-it&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Try it!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

### Nix ‚ùÑÔ∏è

If you already have Nix setup with flake support, you can try out eza with the `nix run` command:

    nix run github:eza-community/eza

Nix will build eza and run it.

If you want to pass arguments this way, use e.g. `nix run github:eza-community/eza -- -ol`.

# Installation

eza is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Platform and distribution
specific installation instructions can be found in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/eza.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/eza/versions)

---

&lt;a id=&quot;options&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Command-line options&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

eza‚Äôs options are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike `ls`‚Äôs. Quick overview:

Fields starting with a capital letter sort uppercase before lowercase. The modified field has the aliases **date**, **time**, and **newest**, while its reverse has the aliases **age** and **oldest**.
- Valid time fields are **modified**, **changed**, **accessed**, and **created**.
- Valid time styles are **default**, **iso**, **long-iso**, **full-iso**, and **relative**.



See the `man` pages for further documentation of usage. They are available
- online [in the repo](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/man)
- in your terminal via `man eza`, as of version [`[0.18.13] - 2024-04-25`](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01813---2024-04-25)
&lt;/details&gt;


## Custom Themes
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

**Eza** has recently added support for a `theme.yml` file, where you can specify all of the existing theme-ing options
available for the `LS_COLORS` and `EXA_COLORS` environment variables, as well as the option to specify different icons
for different file types and extensions. Any existing environment variables set will continue to work and will take
precedence for backwards compatibility.

#### **New** Pre-made themes
Check out the themes available in the official [eza-themes](https://github.com/eza-community/eza-themes) repository, or contribute your own.

An example theme file is available in `docs/theme.yml`, and needs to either be placed in a directory specified by the 
environment variable `EZA_CONFIG_DIR`, or will looked for by default in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/eza`.

Full details are available on the [man page](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/man/eza_colors-explanation.5.md) and an example theme file is included [here](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/docs/theme.yml)

&lt;/details&gt;

[apache parquet]: https://parquet.apache.org/

## Rust Version Compatibility Policy

The Rust toolchain releases are tracked at [Rust Versions](https://releases.rs) and follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A Rust toolchain release can be identified
by a version string like `1.80.0`, or more generally `major.minor.patch`.

DataFusion&#039;s supports the last 4 stable Rust minor versions released and any such versions released within the last 4 months.

For example, given the releases `1.78.0`, `1.79.0`, `1.80.0`, `1.80.1` and `1.81.0` DataFusion will support 1.78.0, which is 3 minor versions prior to the most minor recent `1.81`.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

DataFusion enforces MSRV policy using a [MSRV CI Check](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fdatafusion+rust-version+language%3ATOML+path%3A%2F%5ECargo.toml%2F&amp;type=code)

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html

Welcome to the home page for the `ICU4X` project.

`ICU4X` provides components enabling wide range of software internationalization.
It draws deeply from the experience of [`ICU4C`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/), [`ICU4J`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/) and [`ECMA-402`](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/) and relies on data from the [`CLDR`](http://cldr.unicode.org/) project.

The design goals of `ICU4X` are:

* Small and modular code
* Pluggable locale data
* Availability and ease of use in multiple programming languages
* Written by internationalization experts to encourage best practices

## Documentation

For an introduction to the project, please visit the [&quot;Introduction to ICU4X for Rust&quot;](tutorials/quickstart.md) tutorial. Further tutorials can be found in the [tutorial index](tutorials/index.md).

For technical information on how to use ICU4X, visit our [API docs (latest stable)](https://docs.rs/icu/latest/) or [API docs (tip of main)](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu4x/rustdoc/icu/).

More information about the project can be found in [the documents subdirectory](documents/README.md).

## Quick Start

An example `ICU4X` powered application in Rust may look like below...

`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icu = &quot;1.5.0&quot;
```

`src/main.rs`:

```rust
use icu::calendar::Date;
use icu::datetime::{DateTimeFormatter, fieldsets::YMD};
use icu::locale::locale;

let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new(
    locale!(&quot;es&quot;).into(),
    YMD::long()
)
.expect(&quot;locale should be present in compiled data&quot;);

let date = Date::try_new_iso(2020, 9, 12).expect(&quot;date should be valid&quot;);
let date = date.to_any();

let formatted_date = dtf.format(&amp;date).to_string();
assert_eq!(
    formatted_date,
    &quot;12 de septiembre de 2020&quot;
);
```

## Development

ICU4X is developed by the ICU4X Technical Committee (ICU4X-TC) in the Unicode Consortium. The ICU4X-TC leads strategy and development of internationalization solutions for modern platforms and ecosystems, including client-side and resource-constrained environments. See [unicode.org](https://www.unicode.org/consortium/techchairs.html) for more information on our governance.

ICU4X-TC convenes approximately once per quarter in advance of ICU4X releases. Most work in the interim takes place in the ICU4X Working Group (ICU4X WG), which makes technical recommendations, lands them in the repository, and records them in CHANGELOG.md. The recommendations of ICU4X WG are subject to approval by the ICU4X-TC.

Please subscribe to this repository to participate in discussions.  If you want to contribute, see our [contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Charter

*For the full charter, including answers to frequently asked questions, see [charter.md](documents/process/charter.md).*

ICU4X is a new project whose objective is to solve the needs of clients who wish to provide client-side internationalization for their products in resource-constrained environments.

ICU4X, or &quot;ICU for X&quot;, will be built from the start with several key design constraints:

1. Small and modular code.
2. Pluggable locale data.
3. Availability and ease of use in multiple programming languages.
4. Written by internationalization experts to encourage best practices.

ICU4X will provide an ECMA-402-compatible API surface in the target client-side platforms, including the web platform, iOS, Android, WearOS, WatchOS, Flutter, and Fuchsia, supported in programming languages including Rust, JavaScript, Objective-C, Java, Dart, and C++.

Slint is a declarative GUI toolkit to build native user interfaces for embedded,
desktop, and mobile applications written in Rust, C++, JavaScript, or Python.

The name *Slint* is derived from our design goals:

- **Scalable**: Slint should support responsive UI design, allow cross-platform
    usage across operating systems and processor architectures and support
    multiple programming languages.
- **Lightweight**: Slint should require minimal resources, in terms of memory
    and processing power, and yet deliver a smooth, smartphone-like user
    experience on any device.
- **Intuitive**: Designers and developers should feel productive while enjoying
    the GUI design and development process. The design creation tools should be
    intuitive to use for the designers. Similarly for the developers, the APIs
    should be consistent and easy to use, no matter which programming language
    they choose.
- **Native**: GUI built with Slint should match the end users&#039; expectations of a
    native application irrespective of the platform - desktop, mobile, web or
    embedded system. The UI design should be compiled to machine code and provide
    flexibility that only a native application can offer: Access full operating
    system APIs, utilize all CPU and GPU cores, connect to any peripheral.

Visit [#MadeWithSlint](https://madewithslint.com) to view some of the projects
using Slint. We invite you to use Slint and be part of its community.

## Current Status

Slint is in active development. The state of support for each platform is as
follows:

- **Embedded**: *Ready*. Slint is being used by customers in production on embedded
    devices running embedded Linux and Windows. The Slint run-time requires less than
    300KiB of RAM and can run on different processor architectures such as ARM Cortex M, ARM Cortex A, RISC-V, Intel x86, etc.
    Refer to &lt;https://slint.dev/supported-boards&gt; for list of supported boards.
- **Desktop**: *In Progress*. While Slint is a good fit on Windows, Linux and Mac,
    we are working on improving the platform support in subsequent releases.
- **Web**: *In Progress*. Slint apps can be compiled to WebAssembly and can run
    in a web browser. As there are many other web frameworks, the web platform
    is not one of our primary target platforms. The web support is currently
    limited to demo purposes.
- **Mobile**
  - Android: *In Progress*. Track the progress of work here &lt;https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/issues/46&gt;.
  - iOS: *Todo*. Support for iOS will commence after the initial support for Android is completed.

### Accessibility

Slint supports keyboard based navigation of many widgets, and user interfaces
are scalable. The basic infrastructure for assistive technology like screen
readers is in place. We&#039;re aware that more work is needed to get best-of-class
support for users with special needs.

## Get Started

### Hello World

The UI is defined in a Domain Specific Language that is declarative, easy to use,
intuitive, and provides a powerful way to describe graphical elements, their
placement, their hierarchy, property bindings, and the flow of data through the
different states.

Here&#039;s the obligatory &quot;Hello World&quot;:

```slint
export component HelloWorld inherits Window {
    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;

    Text {
       y: parent.width / 2;
       x: parent.x + 200px;
       text: &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
       color: blue;
    }
}
```

### Documentation

For more details, check out the [Slint Language Documentation](https://slint.dev/docs/slint).

The [examples](examples) folder contains examples and demos, showing how to
use the Slint markup language and how to interact with a Slint user interface
from supported programming languages.

The `docs` folder contains a lot more information, including
[build instructions](docs/building.md), and
[internal developer docs](docs/development.md).

Refer to the README of each language directory in the `api` folder:

- [C++](api/cpp) ([Documentation][#15] | [Getting Started Template][#17])
- [Rust](api/rs/slint) [![Crates.io][#18]][#19] ([Documentation][#20] | [Tutorial Video][#22] | [Getting Started Template][#23])
- [JavaScript/NodeJS (Beta)](api/node) [![npm][#24]][#25] ([Documentation][#26] | [Getting Started Template][#28])
- [Python (Beta)](api/python) [![pypi][#31]][#32] ([Documentation][#33] | [Getting Started Template][#34])

## Architecture

An application is composed of the business logic written in Rust, C++, or
JavaScript and the `.slint` user interface design markup, which is compiled to
native code.

![Architecture Overview](https://slint.dev/resources/architecture.drawio.svg)

### Compiler

The `.slint` files are compiled ahead of time. The expressions in the `.slint`
are pure functions that the compiler can optimize. For example, the compiler
could choose to &quot;inline&quot; properties and remove those that are constant or
unchanged. In the future we hope to improve rendering time on low end devices by
pre-processing images and text. The compiler could determine that a `Text` or an
`Image` element is always on top of another `Image` in the same location.
Consequently both elements could be rendered ahead of time into a single
element, thus cutting down on rendering time.

The compiler uses the typical compiler phases of lexing, parsing, optimization,
and finally code generation. It provides different back-ends for code generation
in the target language. The C++ code generator produces a C++ header file, the
Rust generator produces Rust code, and so on. An interpreter for dynamic
languages is also included.

### Runtime

The runtime library consists of an engine that supports properties declared in
the `.slint` language. Components with their elements, items, and properties are
laid out in a single memory region, to reduce memory allocations.

Rendering backends and styles are configurable at compile time:

- The `femtovg` renderer uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.
- The `skia` renderer uses [Skia](https://skia.org) for rendering.
- The `software` renderer uses the CPU with no additional dependencies.

NOTE: When Qt is installed on the system, the `qt` style becomes available,
using Qt&#039;s QStyle to achieve native looking widgets.

### Tooling

We have a few tools to help with the development of .slint files:

- A [**LSP Server**](./tools/lsp) that adds features like auto-complete and live
  preview of the .slint files to many editors.
- It is bundled in a [**Visual Studio Code Extension**](./editors/vscode)
  available from the market place.
- A [**slint-viewer**](./tools/viewer) tool which displays the .slint files. The
  `--auto-reload` argument makes it easy to preview your UI while you are
  working on it (when using the LSP preview is not possible).
- [**SlintPad**](https://slintpad.com/), an online editor to try out .slint syntax
  without installing anything ([sources](./tools/slintpad)).
- An [**updater**](./tools/updater) to convert the .slint files from
  previous versions to newer versions.
- A [**Figma to Slint**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1474418299182276871/figma-to-slint) plugin.

Please check our [Editors README](./editors/README.md) for tips on how to
configure your favorite editor to work well with Slint.

**Burn is a new comprehensive dynamic Deep Learning Framework built using Rust &lt;br /&gt; with extreme
flexibility, compute efficiency and portability as its primary goals.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

## Performance

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-blazingly-fast.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Because we believe the goal of a deep learning framework is to convert computation into useful
intelligence, we have made performance a core pillar of Burn. We strive to achieve top efficiency by
leveraging multiple optimization techniques described below.

**Click on each section for more details** üëá

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel fusion üí•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Using Burn means having your models optimized on any backend. When possible, we provide a way to
automatically and dynamically create custom kernels that minimize data relocation between different
memory spaces, extremely useful when moving memory is the bottleneck.

As an example, you could write your own GELU activation function with the high level tensor api (see
Rust code snippet below).

```rust
fn gelu_custom&lt;B: Backend, const D: usize&gt;(x: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
    let x = x.clone() * ((x / SQRT_2).erf() + 1);
    x / 2
}
```

Then, at runtime, a custom low-level kernel will be automatically created for your specific
implementation and will rival a handcrafted GPU implementation. The kernel consists of about 60
lines of WGSL [WebGPU Shading Language](&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/&quot;),
an extremely verbose lower level shader language you probably don&#039;t want to program your deep
learning models in!

&gt; As of now, our fusion strategy is only implemented for our own WGPU and CUDA backends and supports
&gt; only a subset of operations. We plan to add more operations very soon and extend this technique to
&gt; other future in-house backends.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Asynchronous execution ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

For [backends developed from scratch by the Burn team](#backends), an asynchronous execution style
is used, which allows to perform various optimizations, such as the previously mentioned automatic
kernel fusion.

Asynchronous execution also ensures that the normal execution of the framework does not block the
model computations, which implies that the framework overhead won&#039;t impact the speed of execution
significantly. Conversely, the intense computations in the model do not interfere with the
responsiveness of the framework. For more information about our asynchronous backends, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Thread-safe building blocks ü¶û
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn emphasizes thread safety by leveraging the
[ownership system of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
With Burn, each module is the owner of its weights. It is therefore possible to send a module to
another thread for computing the gradients, then send the gradients to the main thread that can
aggregate them, and _voil√†_, you get multi-device training.

This is a very different approach from what PyTorch does, where backpropagation actually mutates the
_grad_ attribute of each tensor parameter. This is not a thread-safe operation and therefore
requires lower level synchronization primitives, see
[distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) for reference. Note that
this is still very fast, but not compatible across different backends and quite hard to implement.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Intelligent memory management ü¶Ä
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

One of the main roles of a deep learning framework is to reduce the amount of memory necessary to
run models. The naive way of handling memory is that each tensor has its own memory space, which is
allocated when the tensor is created then deallocated as the tensor gets out of scope. However,
allocating and deallocating data is very costly, so a memory pool is often required to achieve good
throughput. Burn offers an infrastructure that allows for easily creating and selecting memory
management strategies for backends. For more details on memory management in Burn, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

Another very important memory optimization of Burn is that we keep track of when a tensor can be
mutated in-place just by using the ownership system well. Even though it is a rather small memory
optimization on its own, it adds up considerably when training or running inference with larger
models and contributes to reduce the memory usage even more. For more information, see
[this blog post about tensor handling](https://burn.dev/blog/burn-rusty-approach-to-tensor-handling).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel selection üéØ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A good deep learning framework should ensure that models run smoothly on all hardware. However, not
all hardware share the same behavior in terms of execution speed. For instance, a matrix
multiplication kernel can be launched with many different parameters, which are highly sensitive to
the size of the matrices and the hardware. Using the wrong configuration could reduce the speed of
execution by a large factor (10 times or even more in extreme cases), so choosing the right kernels
becomes a priority.

With our home-made backends, we run benchmarks automatically and choose the best configuration for
the current hardware and matrix sizes with a reasonable caching strategy.

This adds a small overhead by increasing the warmup execution time, but stabilizes quickly after a
few forward and backward passes, saving lots of time in the long run. Note that this feature isn&#039;t
mandatory, and can be disabled when cold starts are a priority over optimized throughput.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Hardware specific features üî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is no secret that deep learning is mostly relying on matrix multiplication as its core operation,
since this is how fully-connected neural networks are modeled.

More and more, hardware manufacturers optimize their chips specifically for matrix multiplication
workloads. For instance, Nvidia has its _Tensor Cores_ and today most cellphones have AI specialized
chips. As of this moment, we support Tensor Cores with our LibTorch, Candle, CUDA and WGPU/SPIR-V
backends, but not other accelerators yet. We hope
[this issue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4195) gets resolved at some point to bring
support to our WGPU backend.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Custom Backend Extension üéí
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn aims to be the most flexible deep learning framework. While it&#039;s crucial to maintain
compatibility with a wide variety of backends, Burn also provides the ability to extend the
functionalities of a backend implementation to suit your personal modeling requirements.

This versatility is advantageous in numerous ways, such as supporting custom operations like flash
attention or manually writing your own kernel for a specific backend to enhance performance. See
[this section](https://burn.dev/burn-book/advanced/backend-extension/index.html) in the Burn Book üî•
for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand üëá**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard üìà
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption üõ°

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support üê´
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-standard format that exports both the architecture
and the weights of a deep learning model.

Burn supports the importation of models that follow the ONNX standard so you can easily port a model
you have written in another framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn to benefit from all the
advantages our framework offers.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch Models üöö
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Support for loading of PyTorch model weights into Burn‚Äôs native model architecture, ensuring
seamless integration. See
[Burn Book üî• section on importing PyTorch](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/pytorch-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser üåê
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can compile to Web Assembly: Candle and NdArray for CPU, and WGPU for GPU.
This means that you can run inference directly within a browser. We provide several examples of
this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2Ô∏è‚É£ 7Ô∏è‚É£ üò∞
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! üåÑ

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ‚öôÔ∏è
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Backends

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;
Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust implementations.
We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your models in the cloud,
then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

**We already have many backends implemented, all listed below üëá**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
WGPU (WebGPU): Cross-Platform GPU Backend üåê
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

**The go-to backend for running on any GPU.**

Based on the most popular and well-supported Rust graphics library, [WGPU](https://wgpu.rs), this
backend automatically targets Vulkan, OpenGL, Metal, Direct X11/12, and WebGPU, by using the WebGPU
shading language [WGSL](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/), or optionally
[SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir/) when targeting Vulkan. It can also be compiled to Web
Assembly to run in the browser while leveraging the GPU, see
[this demo](https://antimora.github.io/image-classification/). For more information on the benefits
of this backend, see [this blog](https://burn.dev/blog/cross-platform-gpu-backend).

The WGPU backend is our first &quot;in-house backend&quot;, which means we have complete control over its
implementation details. It is fully optimized with the
[performance characteristics mentioned earlier](#performance), as it serves as our research
playground for a variety of optimizations. We&#039;ve since added CUDA, ROCm and SPIR-V support using the
same compiler infrastructure, so a kernel written for burn once, can run anywhere.

See the [WGPU Backend README](./crates/burn-wgpu/README.md) and
[CUDA Backend README](./crates/burn-cuda/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Candle: Backend using the Candle bindings üïØ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Based on [Candle by Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), a minimalist ML framework
for Rust with a focus on performance and ease of use, this backend can run on CPU with support for
Web Assembly or on Nvidia GPUs using CUDA.

See the [Candle Backend README](./crates/burn-candle/README.md) for more details.

&gt; _Disclaimer:_ This backend is not fully completed yet, but can work in some contexts like
&gt; inference.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
LibTorch: Backend using the LibTorch bindings üéÜ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

PyTorch doesn&#039;t need an introduction in the realm of deep learning. This backend leverages
[PyTorch Rust bindings](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs), enabling you to use LibTorch C++
kernels on CPU, CUDA and Metal.

See the [LibTorch Backend README](./crates/burn-tch/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
NdArray: Backend using the NdArray primitive as data structure ü¶ê
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This CPU backend is admittedly not our fastest backend, but offers extreme portability.

It is our only backend supporting _no_std_.

See the [NdArray Backend README](./crates/burn-ndarray/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend üîÑ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to backends that support it üí•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
For now, only the WGPU and CUDA backends have support for fused kernels.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Fusion, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Fusion&lt;Wgpu&gt;&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}

```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-walking.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book üî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/burn-book/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests üòÑ

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples üôè
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

## Usage, installation, compilation, requirements, license

Each tool uses different technologies, so you can find instructions for each of them in the appropriate file:

- [Czkawka GUI (GTK frontend)](czkawka_gui/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka CLI](czkawka_cli/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka Core](czkawka_core/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Krokiet GUI (Slint frontend)](krokiet/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;

## Comparison to other tools

Bleachbit is a master at finding and removing temporary files, while Czkawka only finds the most basic ones. So these
two apps shouldn&#039;t be compared directly or be considered as an alternative to one another.

In this comparison remember, that even if app have same features they may work different(e.g. one app may have more
options to choose than other).

## Other apps

There are many similar applications to Czkawka on the Internet, which do some things better and some things worse:

### GUI

- [DupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) - Many options to customize; great photo compare tool
- [FSlint](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) - A little outdated, but still have some tools not available in Czkawka
- [AntiDupl.NET](https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl) - Shows a lot of metadata of compared images
- [Video Duplicate Finder](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder) - Finds similar videos(surprising, isn&#039;t it), supports video thumbnails

### CLI

Due to limited time, the biggest emphasis is on the GUI version so if you are looking for really good and feature-packed
console apps, then take a look at these:

- [Fclones](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones) - One of the fastest tools to find duplicates; it is written also in
  Rust
- [Rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint) - Nice console interface and also is feature packed
- [RdFind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind) - Fast, but written in C++ ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome.

You can help by creating:

- Bug reports - memory leaks, unexpected behavior, crashes

## Thanks

Big thanks to P√°draig Brady, creator of fantastic FSlint, because without his work I wouldn&#039;t create this tool.

Thanks also to all the people who create patches for this program, make it available on other systems, create videos,
articles about it etc.

Also, I really appreciate work of people that create crates on which Czkawka is based and for that I try to report bugs
to make it even better.

## Donations

If you are using the app, I would appreciate a donation for its further development, which can be
done [here](https://github.com/sponsors/qarmin).

# bootc

Transactional, in-place operating system updates using OCI/Docker container images.

## Motivation

The original Docker container model of using &quot;layers&quot; to model
applications has been extremely successful.  This project
aims to apply the same technique for bootable host systems - using
standard OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery format
for base operating system updates.

The container image includes a Linux kernel (in e.g. `/usr/lib/modules`),
which is used to boot.  At runtime on a target system, the base userspace is
*not* itself running in a &quot;container&quot; by default. For example, assuming
systemd is in use, systemd acts as pid1 as usual - there&#039;s no &quot;outer&quot; process.
More about this in the docs; see below.

## Status

The CLI and API are considered stable. We will ensure that every existing system
can be upgraded in place seamlessly across any future changes.

## Documentation

See the [project documentation](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/).

## Adopters (base and end-user images)

The bootc CLI is just a client system; it is not tied to any particular
operating system or Linux distribution. You very likely want to actually
start by looking at [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md).

## Community discussion

The [Github discussion forum](https://github.com/containers/bootc/discussions) is enabled.

This project is also tightly related to the previously mentioned Fedora/CentOS bootc project,
and many developers monitor the relevant discussion forums there. In particular there&#039;s a
Matrix channel and a weekly video call meeting for example: &lt;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/community/&gt;.

[Ratatui][Ratatui Website] (_Àår√¶.t…ôÀàtu.i_) is a Rust crate for cooking up terminal user interfaces
(TUIs). It provides a simple and flexible way to create text-based user interfaces in the terminal,
which can be used for command-line applications, dashboards, and other interactive console programs.

## Quickstart

Ratatui has [templates] available to help you get started quickly. You can use the
[`cargo-generate`] command to create a new project with Ratatui:

```shell
cargo install --locked cargo-generate
cargo generate ratatui/templates
```

Selecting the Hello World template produces the following application:

```rust
use color_eyre::Result;
use crossterm::event::{self, Event};
use ratatui::{DefaultTerminal, Frame};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    color_eyre::install()?;
    let terminal = ratatui::init();
    let result = run(terminal);
    ratatui::restore();
    result
}

fn run(mut terminal: DefaultTerminal) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    loop {
        terminal.draw(render)?;
        if matches!(event::read()?, Event::Key(_)) {
            break Ok(());
        }
    }
}

fn render(frame: &amp;mut Frame) {
    frame.render_widget(&quot;hello world&quot;, frame.area());
}
```

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in `ci/rust-version.sh` and if necessary, install that version by running:

```bash
$ rustup install VERSION
```

Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an [override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in order to use the correct version.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

On Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo test
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

- `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it&#039;s a _solution_ to
some problem. Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of _problems_ the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn&#039;t _infringe_ on anyone else&#039;s solutions. Adding a
test _protects_ your solution from future changes. Say you don&#039;t understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, &quot;what
problem is solved by this code?&quot; On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it&#039;s protecting, please
send us that patch!
