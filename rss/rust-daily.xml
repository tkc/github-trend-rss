**Krokiet** ((IPA: [ˈkrɔcɛt]), &quot;croquette&quot; in Polish) new generation GUI frontend, simple, multiplatform, fast and free app to remove unnecessary files from your computer.

![czkawka_logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41945903/102616149-66490400-4137-11eb-9cd6-813b2b070834.png)

**Czkawka** (_tch•kav•ka_ (IPA: [ˈʧ̑kafka]), &quot;hiccup&quot; in Polish) older gtk4 GUI frontend, superseded by Krokiet, but still receiving bugfix updates.

## Features

- Written in memory-safe Rust - almost 100% unsafe code free
- Amazingly fast - due to using more or less advanced algorithms and multithreading
- Free, Open Source without ads
- Multiplatform - works on Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD and many more
- Cache support - second and further scans should be much faster than the first one
- CLI frontend - for easy automation
- GUI frontend - uses Slint or GTK 4 frameworks
- Core library - allows to reuse functionality in other apps
- No spying - Czkawka does not have access to the Internet, nor does it collect any user information or statistics
- Multilingual - support multiple languages like Polish, English or Italian
- Multiple tools to use:
    - Duplicates - Finds duplicates based on file name, size or hash
    - Empty Folders - Finds empty folders with the help of an advanced algorithm
    - Big Files - Finds the provided number of the biggest files in given location
    - Empty Files - Looks for empty files across the drive
    - Temporary Files - Finds temporary files
    - Similar Images - Finds images which are not exactly the same (different resolution, watermarks)
    - Similar Videos - Looks for visually similar videos
    - Same Music - Searches for similar music by tags or by reading content and comparing it
    - Invalid Symbolic Links - Shows symbolic links which point to non-existent files/directories
    - Broken Files - Finds files that are invalid or corrupted
    - Bad Extensions - Lists files whose content not match with their extension
    - Exif Remover - Removes Exif metadata from various file types
    - Video Optimizer - Crops from static parts and converts videos to more efficient formats
    - Bad Names - Finds files with names that may be not wanted (e.g., containing special characters)

Changelog about each version can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](Changelog.md).

New releases can be found in [Github releases](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases) and nightly builds also in [Nightly releases](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases/tag/Nightly)

## Usage, installation, compilation, requirements, license

Each tool uses different technologies, so you can find instructions for each of them in the appropriate file:

- [Krokiet GUI (Slint frontend)](krokiet/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka GUI (GTK frontend)](czkawka_gui/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka CLI](czkawka_cli/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka Core](czkawka_core/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;

## Comparison to other tools

Bleachbit is a master at finding and removing temporary files, while Czkawka only finds the most basic ones. So these
two apps shouldn&#039;t be compared directly or be considered as an alternative to one another.

In this comparison remember, that even if app have same features they may work different(e.g. one app may have more
options to choose than other).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Few small commits added recently and last version released in 2023&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; Czkawka GTK is in maintenance mode receiving only bugfixes&lt;/p&gt;

## Other apps

There are many similar applications to Czkawka on the Internet, which do some things better and some things worse:

### GUI

- [DupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) - Many options to customize; great photo compare tool
- [FSlint](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) - A little outdated, but still have some tools not available in Czkawka
- [AntiDupl.NET](https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl) - Shows a lot of metadata of compared images
- [Video Duplicate Finder](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder) - Finds similar videos(surprising, isn&#039;t it), supports video thumbnails

### CLI

Due to limited time, the biggest emphasis is on the GUI version so if you are looking for really good and feature-packed
console apps, then take a look at these:

- [Fclones](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones) - One of the fastest tools to find duplicates; it is written also in
  Rust
- [Rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint) - Nice console interface and also is feature packed
- [RdFind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind) - Fast, but written in C++ ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯


## Projects using Czkawka

Czkawka exposes its common functionality through a crate called **`czkawka_core`**, which can be reused by other projects.

It is written in Rust and is used by all Czkawka frontends (`czkawka_gui`, `czkawka_cli`, `krokiet`).

It is also used by external projects, such as:

- **Czkawka Tauri** - https://github.com/shixinhuang99/czkawka-tauri - A Tauri-based GUI frontend for Czkawka.
- **page-dewarp** – https://github.com/lmmx/page-dewarp - A library for dewarping document images using a cubic sheet model.

Bindings are also available for:

- **Python** – https://pypi.org/project/czkawka/

Some projects work as wrappers around `czkawka_cli`. Without directly depending on `czkawka_core`, they allow simple scanning and retrieving results in JSON format:

- **Schluckauf** – https://github.com/fadykuzman/schluckauf

## Thanks

Big thanks to Pádraig Brady, creator of fantastic FSlint, because without his work I wouldn&#039;t create this tool.

Thanks also to all the people who create patches for this program, create and fix translations, make it available on other systems, create videos,
articles about it etc.

Also, I really appreciate work of people that create crates on which Czkawka is based and for that I try to report bugs
to make it even better.

## Officially Supported Projects
Only this repository, [prebuild-binaries](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases), projects on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/czkawka_gui) and [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.qarmin.czkawka) are directly maintained by me.  

Czkawka does not have an official website, so do not trust any sites that claim to be the official one.  

If you use packages from unofficial sources, make sure they are safe.

If you want Codex in your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide&quot;&gt;install in your IDE.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;If you are looking for the &lt;em&gt;cloud-based agent&lt;/em&gt; from OpenAI, &lt;strong&gt;Codex Web&lt;/strong&gt;, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/codex&quot;&gt;chatgpt.com/codex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).

# Your procedural toolbox for 2D content creation

**Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics engine, [available now](https://editor.graphite.art) in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.**

Having begun life as a vector editor, Graphite continues evolving into a generalized, all-in-one graphics toolbox that&#039;s built more like a game engine than a conventional creative app. The editor&#039;s tools wrap its node graph core, providing user-friendly workflows for vector, raster, and beyond. Photo editing, motion graphics, digital painting, desktop publishing, and VFX compositing are additional competencies on the planned [roadmap](https://graphite.art/features/#roadmap) making Graphite into a highly versatile content creation tool.

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## Why Dynamo

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models exceed single-GPU capacity. Tensor parallelism spreads layers across GPUs but creates coordination challenges. Dynamo closes this orchestration gap.

Dynamo is inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang) and provides:

- **Disaggregated Prefill &amp; Decode** – Maximizes GPU throughput with latency/throughput trade-offs
- **Dynamic GPU Scheduling** – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-Aware Request Routing** – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated Data Transfer** – Reduces inference response time using NIXL
- **KV Cache Offloading** – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher throughput

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dynamo architecture&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Built in Rust for performance and Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source with an OSS-first development approach.

## Contributing

Want to help shape the future of distributed LLM inference? We welcome contributors at all levels—from doc fixes to new features.

- **[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)** – How to get started
- **[Report a Bug](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)** – Found an issue?
- **[Feature Request](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)** – Have an idea?

# Local Quick Start

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/reference/support-matrix.md](docs/reference/support-matrix.md)

## 1. Initial Setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install Python Development Headers

Backend engines require Python development headers for JIT compilation. Install them with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

## 2. Select an Engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, and trtllm. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Sanity Check (Optional)

Before trying out Dynamo, you can verify your system configuration and dependencies:

```bash
python3 deploy/sanity_check.py
```

This is a quick check for system resources, development tools, LLM frameworks, and Dynamo components.

### Running an LLM API Server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```bash
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server with prompt templating, tokenization, and routing.
# For local dev: --store-kv file avoids etcd (workers and frontend must share a disk)
python3 -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 --store-kv file

# Start the SGLang engine. You can run several of these for the same or different models.
# The frontend will discover them automatically.
python3 -m dynamo.sglang --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B --store-kv file
```

&gt; **Note:** vLLM workers publish KV cache events by default, which requires NATS. For dependency-free local development with vLLM, add `--kv-events-config &#039;{&quot;enable_kv_cache_events&quot;: false}&#039;`. This keeps local prefix caching enabled while disabling event publishing. See [Service Discovery and Messaging](#service-discovery-and-messaging) for details.

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### What&#039;s Next?

- **Scale up**: Deploy on Kubernetes with [Recipes](recipes/)
- **Add features**: Enable [KV-aware routing](docs/router/kv_cache_routing.md), [disaggregated serving](docs/design_docs/disagg_serving.md)
- **Benchmark**: Use [AIPerf](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md) to measure performance
- **Try other engines**: [vLLM](docs/backends/vllm/), [SGLang](docs/backends/sglang/), [TensorRT-LLM](docs/backends/trtllm/)

# Concepts

## Engines

Dynamo is inference engine agnostic. Install the wheel for your chosen engine and run with `python3 -m dynamo.&lt;engine&gt; --help`.

| Engine | Install | Docs | Best For |
|--------|---------|------|----------|
| vLLM | `uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]` | [Guide](docs/backends/vllm/) | Broadest feature coverage |
| SGLang | `uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]` | [Guide](docs/backends/sglang/) | High-throughput serving |
| TensorRT-LLM | `pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com ai-dynamo[trtllm]` | [Guide](docs/backends/trtllm/) | Maximum performance |

&gt; **Note:** TensorRT-LLM requires `pip` (not `uv`) due to URL-based dependencies. See the [TRT-LLM guide](docs/backends/trtllm/) for container setup and prerequisites.

Use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to specify which GPUs to use. Engine-specific options (context length, multi-GPU, etc.) are documented in each backend guide.

## Service Discovery and Messaging

Dynamo uses TCP for inter-component communication. External services are optional for most deployments:

| Deployment | etcd | NATS | Notes |
|------------|------|------|-------|
| **Kubernetes** | ❌ Not required | ❌ Not required | K8s-native discovery; TCP request plane |
| **Local Development** | ❌ Not required | ❌ Not required | Pass `--store-kv file`; vLLM also needs `--kv-events-config &#039;{&quot;enable_kv_cache_events&quot;: false}&#039;` |
| **KV-Aware Routing** | — | ✅ Required | Prefix caching enabled by default requires NATS |

For local development without external dependencies, pass `--store-kv file` (avoids etcd) to both the frontend and workers. vLLM users should also pass `--kv-events-config &#039;{&quot;enable_kv_cache_events&quot;: false}&#039;` to disable KV event publishing (avoids NATS) while keeping local prefix caching enabled; SGLang and TRT-LLM don&#039;t require this flag.

For distributed non-Kubernetes deployments or KV-aware routing:

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs JetStream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup both: `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d`

# Advanced Topics

## Benchmarking

Dynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools:

- **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** – Compare deployment topologies using AIPerf
- **[SLA-Driven Deployments](docs/planner/sla_planner_quickstart.md)** – Optimize deployments to meet SLA requirements

## Frontend OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAI-compatible frontend exposes an OpenAPI 3 spec at `/openapi.json`. To generate without running the server:

```bash
cargo run -p dynamo-llm --bin generate-frontend-openapi
```

This writes to `docs/frontends/openapi.json`.

If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.

## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don&#039;t have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install Build Tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust Bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install GPU Memory Service

The GPU Memory Service is a Python package with a C++ extension. It requires only Python development headers and a C++ compiler (g++).

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e lib/gpu_memory_service
```

## 7. Install the Wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e .
```

You should now be able to run `python3 -m dynamo.frontend`.

For local development, pass `--store-kv file` to avoid external dependencies (see Service Discovery and Messaging section).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.

**Burn is a next generation Tensor Library and Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on
&lt;br /&gt; flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Burn is both a tensor library and a deep learning framework optimized for numerical computing, model
inference and model training. Burn leverages Rust to perform optimizations normally only available
in static-graph frameworks, offering optimal speed without impacting flexibility.

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust
implementations. We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your
models in the cloud, then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.

&lt;/div&gt;

### Supported Backends

Most backends support all operating systems, so we don&#039;t mention them in the tables below.

**GPU Backends:**

|         | CUDA | ROCm | Metal | Vulkan | WebGPU | Candle | LibTorch |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Nvidia  | ☑️   | -    | -     | ☑️     | ☑️     | ☑️     | ☑️       |
| AMD     | -    | ☑️   | -     | ☑️     | ☑️     | -      | ☑️       |
| Apple   | -    | -    | ☑️    | -      | ☑️     | -      | ☑️       |
| Intel   | -    | -    | -     | ☑️     | ☑️     | -      | -        |
| Qualcom | -    | -    | -     | ☑️     | ☑️     | -      | -        |
| Wasm    | -    | -    | -     | -      | ☑️     | -      | -        |

**CPU Backends:**

|        | Cpu (CubeCL) | NdArray | Candle | LibTorch |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| X86    | ☑️           | ☑️      | ☑️     | ☑️       |
| Arm    | ☑️           | ☑️      | ☑️     | ☑️       |
| Wasm   | -            | ☑️      | ☑️     | -        |
| no-std | -            | ☑️      | -      | -        |

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend 🔄
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let device = Default::default();

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &amp;device).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
All first-party accelerated backends (like WGPU and CUDA) use Fusion by default (`burn/fusion`
feature flag), so you typically don&#039;t need to apply it manually.

```rust
#[cfg(not(feature = &quot;fusion&quot;))]
pub type Cuda&lt;F = f32, I = i32&gt; = CubeBackend&lt;CudaRuntime, F, I, u8&gt;;

#[cfg(feature = &quot;fusion&quot;)]
pub type Cuda&lt;F = f32, I = i32&gt; = burn_fusion::Fusion&lt;CubeBackend&lt;CudaRuntime, F, I, u8&gt;&gt;;
```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on
the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server. The client sends tensor operations over the
network to a remote compute backend. You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line
of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand 👇**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard 📈
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption 🛡

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support 🐫
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn supports importing ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models, allowing you to easily port
models from TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn. The ONNX model is converted into Rust code that uses
Burn&#039;s native APIs, enabling the imported model to run on any Burn backend (CPU, GPU, WebAssembly)
and benefit from all of Burn&#039;s optimizations like automatic kernel fusion.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-onnx/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch or Safetensors Models 🚚
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You can load weights from PyTorch or Safetensors formats directly into your Burn-defined models.
This makes it easy to reuse existing models while benefiting from Burn&#039;s performance and deployment
features.

Learn more:

- [Import pre-trained PyTorch models into Burn](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/pytorch-model.html)
- [Load models from Safetensors format](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/safetensors-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser 🌐
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can run in WebAssembly environments: Candle and NdArray for CPU execution,
and WGPU for GPU acceleration via WebGPU. This means that you can run inference directly within a
browser. We provide several examples of this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2️⃣ 7️⃣ 😰
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! 🌄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ⚙️
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).

&gt; ⚠️ **Warning** When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related
&gt; to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency
&gt; chain. To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs`
&gt; file:
&gt;
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due
&gt; to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.

## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-walking.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/books/burn/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests 😄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples 🙏
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

We have a somewhat large amount of [examples](./examples) in the repository that shows how to use
the framework in different scenarios.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Pre-trained Models 🤖
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

We keep an updated and curated list of models and examples built with Burn, see the
[tracel-ai/models repository](https://github.com/tracel-ai/models) for more details.

Don&#039;t see the model you want? Don&#039;t hesitate to open an issue, and we may prioritize it. Built a
model using Burn and want to share it? You can also open a Pull Request and add your model under the
community section!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Why use Rust for Deep Learning? 🦀
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Deep Learning is a special form of software where you need very high level abstractions as well as
extremely fast execution time. Rust is the perfect candidate for that use case since it provides
zero-cost abstractions to easily create neural network modules, and fine-grained control over memory
to optimize every detail.

It&#039;s important that a framework be easy to use at a high level so that its users can focus on
innovating in the AI field. However, since running models relies so heavily on computations,
performance can&#039;t be neglected.

To this day, the mainstream solution to this problem has been to offer APIs in Python, but rely on
bindings to low-level languages such as C/C++. This reduces portability, increases complexity and
creates frictions between researchers and engineers. We feel like Rust&#039;s approach to abstractions
makes it versatile enough to tackle this two languages dichotomy.

Rust also comes with the Cargo package manager, which makes it incredibly easy to build, test, and
deploy from any environment, which is usually a pain in Python.

Although Rust has the reputation of being a difficult language at first, we strongly believe it
leads to more reliable, bug-free solutions built faster (after some practice 😅)!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&gt; **Deprecation Note**&lt;br /&gt;Since `0.14.0`, the internal structure for tensor data has changed. The
&gt; previous `Data` struct was deprecated and officially removed since `0.17.0` in favor of the new
&gt; `TensorData` struct, which allows for more flexibility by storing the underlying data as bytes and
&gt; keeping the data type as a field. If you are using `Data` in your code, make sure to switch to
&gt; `TensorData`.

&lt;!-- &gt;
&gt; In the event that you are trying to load a model record saved in a previous version, make sure to
&gt; enable the `record-backward-compat` feature using a previous version of burn (&lt;=0.16.0). Otherwise,
&gt; the record won&#039;t be deserialized correctly and you will get an error message (which will also point
&gt; you to the backward compatible feature flag). The backward compatibility was maintained for
&gt; deserialization (loading), so as soon as you have saved the record again it will be saved according
&gt; to the new structure and you will be able to upgrade to this version. Please note that binary formats
&gt; are not backward compatible. Thus, you will need to load your record in a previous version and save it
&gt; to another of the self-describing record formats before using a compatible version (as described) with the
&gt; `record-backward-compat` feature flag. --&gt;

&lt;details id=&quot;deprecation&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Loading Model Records From Previous Versions ⚠️
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In the event that you are trying to load a model record saved in a version older than `0.14.0`, make
sure to use a compatible version (`0.14`, `0.15` or `0.16`) with the `record-backward-compat`
feature flag.

```
features = [..., &quot;record-backward-compat&quot;]
```

Otherwise, the record won&#039;t be deserialized correctly and you will get an error message. This err

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio&#039;s zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust&#039;s ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system&#039;s event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc.).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

[net]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html
[scheduler]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you enable the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1.49.0&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&amp;mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(0) =&gt; return,
                    Ok(n) =&gt; n,
                    Err(e) =&gt; {
                        eprintln!(&quot;failed to read from socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&amp;buf[0..n]).await {
                    eprintln!(&quot;failed to write to socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Supported Rust Versions

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- tokio/README.md
- tokio/Cargo.toml
- tokio-util/Cargo.toml
- tokio-test/Cargo.toml
- tokio-stream/Cargo.toml
--&gt;

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.71.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.48 to now  - Rust 1.71
 * 1.39 to 1.47 - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn&#039;t follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

 * `1.43.x` - LTS release until March 2026. (MSRV 1.70)
 * `1.47.x` - LTS release until September 2026. (MSRV 1.70)

Each LTS release will continue to receive backported fixes for at least a year.
If you wish to use a fixed minor release in your project, we recommend that you
use an LTS release.

To use a fixed minor version, you can specify the version with a tilde. For
example, to specify that you wish to use the newest `1.43.x` patch release, you
can use the following dependency specification:
```text
tokio = { version = &quot;~1.43&quot;, features = [...] }
```

### Previous LTS releases

 * `1.8.x` - LTS release until February 2022.
 * `1.14.x` - LTS release until June 2022.
 * `1.18.x` - LTS release until June 2023.
 * `1.20.x` - LTS release until September 2023.
 * `1.25.x` - LTS release until March 2024.
 * `1.32.x` - LTS release until September 2024.
 * `1.36.x` - LTS release until March 2025.
 * `1.38.x` - LTS release until July 2025.

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- ☁️ **Virtual Filesystem**: Remote file management, custom search engines.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

To find out more see the [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/), look
in the [docs/content](docs/content) folder of this repository or visit the [Zola community forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and its template engine [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

Tauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:

| Platform   | Versions                                                                                                        |

## Contributing

Before you start working on something, it&#039;s best to check if there is an existing issue first. It&#039;s also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

Thank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!

### Documentation

Documentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation in the Rust &amp; JS source code as much as possible. Check out the hosting repository for the documentation site for further information: &lt;https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs&gt;

#### What is a Text Expander?

A *text expander* is a program that detects when you type
a specific **keyword** and replaces it with **something else**.

* **Save a lot of typing**, expanding common sentences.
* Create **system-wide** code snippets.
* Execute **custom scripts**
* Use **emojis** like a pro.

___

## Key Features

* Works on **Windows**, **macOS** and **Linux**
* Works with almost **any program**
* Works with **Emojis** 😄
* Works with **Images**
* Includes a powerful **Search Bar** 🔎
* **Date** expansion support
* **Custom scripts** support
* **Shell commands** support
* **App-specific** configurations
* Support [Forms](https://espanso.org/docs/matches/forms/)

## What is it?

- Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html).
- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## Demo

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

[![demo](./docs/tapes/demo.gif)](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

See [demo transcript](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html).

## Quickstart

### Install mise

See [Getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for more options.

```sh-session
$ curl https://mise.run | sh
$ ~/.local/bin/mise --version
              _                                        __
   ____ ___  (_)_______        ___  ____        ____  / /___ _________
  / __ `__ \/ / ___/ _ \______/ _ \/ __ \______/ __ \/ / __ `/ ___/ _ \
 / / / / / / (__  )  __/_____/  __/ / / /_____/ /_/ / / /_/ / /__/  __/
/_/ /_/ /_/_/____/\___/      \___/_/ /_/     / .___/_/\__,_/\___/\___/
                                            /_/                 by @jdx
2026.1.7 macos-arm64 (2026-01-25)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@24 -- node -v
mise node@24.x.x ✓ installed
v24.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@24 go@1
$ node -v
v24.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

## GitHub Issues &amp; Discussions

Due to the volume of issue submissions mise received, using GitHub Issues became unsustainable for
the project. Instead, mise uses GitHub Discussions which provide a more community-centric platform
for communication and require less management on the part of the maintainers.

Please note the following discussion categories, which match how issues are often used:

- [Announcements](https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/categories/announcements)
- [Ideas](https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/categories/ideas): for feature requests, etc.
- [Troubleshooting &amp; Bug Reports](https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/categories/troubleshooting-and-bug-reports)

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.html#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Tabs.html)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Layout.html#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config
- Works with [screen readers](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Accessibility.html)

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html) page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out [awesome-niri], a list of niri-related links and projects.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: [integrated](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite) via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.

## Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

## Quick Start

#### Mac, Linux, Windows (WSL)

```bash
curl -sSL https://usegitai.com/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (non-WSL)

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command &quot;irm http://usegitai.com/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

🎊 That&#039;s it! **No per-repo setup.** Once installed Git AI will work OOTB with any of these **Supported Agents**:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai/raw/main/assets/docs/supported-agents.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;

### Documentation https://usegitai.com/docs
- [AI Blame](https://usegitai.com/docs/cli/ai-blame)
- [Cross-Agent Prompt Saving](https://usegitai.com/docs/cli/prompt-storage)
- [CLI Reference](https://usegitai.com/docs/cli/reference)
- [Configuring Git AI for the enterprise](https://usegitai.com/docs/cli/configuration)

### Just Install and Commit

Build as usual. Just prompt, edit and commit. Git AI will track every line of AI-Code and record the Coding Agent, Model, and prompt that generated it. 

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai/raw/main/assets/docs/graph.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

#### How Does it work? 

Supported Coding Agents call Git AI and mark the lines they insert as AI-generated. 

On commit, Git AI saves the final AI-attributions into a Git Note. These notes power AI-Blame, AI contribution stats, and more. The CLI makes sure these notes are preserved through rebases, merges, squashes, cherry-picks, etc.

![Git Tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd20990-ec0b-4a53-afa4-89fa33de9541)

The format of the notes is outlined here in the [Git AI Standard v3.0.0](https://github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai/blob/main/specs/git_ai_standard_v3.0.0.md)

## Goals of `git-ai` project

🤖 **Track AI code in a Multi-Agent** world. Because developers get to choose their tools, engineering teams need a **vendor agnostic** way to track AI impact in their repos.

🎯 **Accurate attribution** from Laptop → Pull Request → Merged. Claude Code, Cursor and Copilot cannot track code after generation—Git AI follows it through the entire workflow.

🔄 **Support real-world git workflows** by making sure AI-Authorship annotations survive a `merge --squash`, `rebase`, `reset`, `cherry-pick` etc.

🔗 **Maintain link between prompts and code** - there is valuable context and requirements in team prompts—preserve them alongside code.

🚀 **Git-native + Fast** - `git-ai` is built on git plumbing commands. Negligible impact even in large repos (&amp;lt;100ms). Tested in [Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium).

## Agent Support

`git-ai` automatically sets up all supported agent hooks using the `git-ai install-hooks` command

&gt; 🚧 **Release Candidate**
&gt;
&gt; Rolldown is currently in RC status. While it can already handle most production use cases, there may still be bugs and rough edges. Most notably, the built-in minification feature is still in alpha status.

# Rolldown

Rolldown is a JavaScript/TypeScript bundler written in Rust intended to serve as the future bundler used in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It provides Rollup-compatible APIs and plugin interface, but will be more similar to esbuild in scope.

For more information, please check out the documentation at [rolldown.rs](https://rolldown.rs/guide/getting-started).

## VoidZero Inc.

Rolldown is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc).

Candle is a minimalist ML framework for Rust with a focus on performance (including GPU support) 
and ease of use. Try our online demos: 
[whisper](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-whisper),
[LLaMA2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2),
[T5](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/Candle-T5-Generation-Wasm),
[yolo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-yolo),
[Segment
Anything](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/candle-segment-anything-wasm).

## Get started

Make sure that you have [`candle-core`](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/tree/main/candle-core) correctly installed as described in [**Installation**](https://huggingface.github.io/candle/guide/installation.html).

Let&#039;s see how to run a simple matrix multiplication.
Write the following to your `myapp/src/main.rs` file:
```rust
use candle_core::{Device, Tensor};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let device = Device::Cpu;

    let a = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (2, 3), &amp;device)?;
    let b = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (3, 4), &amp;device)?;

    let c = a.matmul(&amp;b)?;
    println!(&quot;{c}&quot;);
    Ok(())
}
```

`cargo run` should display a tensor of shape `Tensor[[2, 4], f32]`.


Having installed `candle` with Cuda support, simply define the `device` to be on GPU:

```diff
- let device = Device::Cpu;
+ let device = Device::new_cuda(0)?;
```

For more advanced examples, please have a look at the following section.

For LLaMA2, run the following command to retrieve the weight files and start a
test server:
```bash
cd candle-wasm-examples/llama2-c
wget https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2/resolve/main/model.bin

## FAQ

### Why should I use Candle?

&lt;!--- ANCHOR: goals ---&gt;

Candle&#039;s core goal is to *make serverless inference possible*. Full machine learning frameworks like PyTorch
are very large, which makes creating instances on a cluster slow. Candle allows deployment of lightweight
binaries.

Secondly, Candle lets you *remove Python* from production workloads. Python overhead can seriously hurt performance,
and the [GIL](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-python-gil-past-present-and-future/) is a notorious source of headaches.

Finally, Rust is cool! A lot of the HF ecosystem already has Rust crates, like [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) and [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).

&lt;!--- ANCHOR_END: goals ---&gt;

### Other ML frameworks

- [dfdx](https://github.com/coreylowman/dfdx) is a formidable crate, with shapes being included
  in types. This prevents a lot of headaches by getting the compiler to complain about shape mismatches right off the bat.
  However, we found that some features still require nightly, and writing code can be a bit daunting for non rust experts.

  We&#039;re leveraging and contributing to other core crates for the runtime so hopefully both crates can benefit from each
  other.

- [burn](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn) is a general crate that can leverage multiple backends so you can choose the best
  engine for your workload.

- [tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs.git) Bindings to the torch library in Rust. Extremely versatile, but they 
  bring in the entire torch library into the runtime. The main contributor of `tch-rs` is also involved in the development
  of `candle`.

### Common Errors

#### Missing symbols when compiling with the mkl feature.

If you get some missing symbols when compiling binaries/tests using the mkl
or accelerate features, e.g. for mkl you get:
```
  = note: /usr/bin/ld: (....o): in function `blas::sgemm&#039;:
          .../blas-0.22.0/src/lib.rs:1944: undefined reference to `sgemm_&#039; collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  = note: some `extern` functions couldn&#039;t be found; some native libraries may need to be installed or have their path specified
  = note: use the `-l` flag to specify native libraries to link
  = note: use the `cargo:rustc-link-lib` directive to specify the native libraries to link with Cargo
```
or for accelerate:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
            &quot;_dgemm_&quot;, referenced from:
                candle_core::accelerate::dgemm::h1b71a038552bcabe in libcandle_core...
            &quot;_sgemm_&quot;, referenced from:
                candle_core::accelerate::sgemm::h2cf21c592cba3c47 in libcandle_core...
          ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
```

This is likely due to a missing linker flag that was needed to enable the mkl library. You
can try adding the following for mkl at the top of your binary:
```rust
extern crate intel_mkl_src;
```
or for accelerate:
```rust
extern crate accelerate_src;
```

#### Cannot run the LLaMA examples: access to source requires login credentials

```
Error: request error: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf/resolve/main/tokenizer.json: status code 401
```

This is likely because you&#039;re not permissioned for the LLaMA-v2 model. To fix
this, you have to register on the huggingface-hub, accept the [LLaMA-v2 model
conditions](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf), and set up your
authentication token. See issue

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. **Add Provider**: Click &quot;Add Provider&quot; → Choose preset or create custom configuration
2. **Switch Provider**:
   - Main UI: Select provider → Click &quot;Enable&quot;
   - System Tray: Click provider name directly (instant effect)
3. **Takes Effect**: Restart your terminal or Claude Code / Codex / Gemini clients to apply changes
4. **Back to Official**: Select the &quot;Official Login&quot; preset (Claude/Codex) or &quot;Google Official&quot; preset (Gemini), restart the corresponding client, then follow its login/OAuth flow

### MCP Management

- **Location**: Click &quot;MCP&quot; button in top-right corner
- **Add Server**:
  - Use built-in templates (mcp-fetch, mcp-filesystem, etc.)
  - Support stdio / http / sse transport types
  - Configure independent MCP servers for different apps
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle switches to control which servers sync to live config
- **Sync**: Enabled servers auto-sync to each app&#039;s live files
- **Import/Export**: Import existing MCP servers from Claude/Codex/Gemini config files

### Skills Management (v3.7.0 New)

- **Location**: Click &quot;Skills&quot; button in top-right corner
- **Discover Skills**:
  - Auto-scan pre-configured GitHub repositories (Anthropic official, ComposioHQ, community, etc.)
  - Add custom repositories (supports subdirectory scanning)
- **Install Skills**: Click &quot;Install&quot; to one-click install to `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Uninstall Skills**: Click &quot;Uninstall&quot; to safely remove and clean up state
- **Manage Repositories**: Add/remove custom GitHub repositories

### Prompts Management (v3.7.0 New)

- **Location**: Click &quot;Prompts&quot; button in top-right corner
- **Create Presets**:
  - Create unlimited system prompt presets
  - Use Markdown editor to write prompts (syntax highlighting + real-time preview)
- **Switch Presets**: Select preset → Click &quot;Activate&quot; to apply immediately
- **Sync Mechanism**:
  - Claude: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  - Codex: `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
  - Gemini: `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`
- **Protection Mechanism**: Auto-save current prompt content before switching, preserves manual modifications

### Configuration Files

**Claude Code**

- Live config: `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `claude.json`)
- API key field: `env.ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or `env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- MCP servers: `~/.claude.json` → `mcpServers`

**Codex**

- Live config: `~/.codex/auth.json` (required) + `config.toml` (optional)
- API key field: `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `auth.json`
- MCP servers: `~/.codex/config.toml` → `[mcp_servers]` tables

**Gemini**

- Live config: `~/.gemini/.env` (API key) + `~/.gemini/settings.json` (auth mode)
- API key field: `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Environment variables: Support `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, etc.
- MCP servers: `~/.gemini/settings.json` → `mcpServers`
- Tray quick switch: Each provider switch rewrites `~/.gemini/.env`, no need to restart Gemini CLI

**CC Switch Storage (v3.8.0 New Architecture)**

- Database (SSOT): `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite, stores providers, MCP, Prompts, Skills)
- Local settings: `~/.cc-switch/settings.json` (device-level settings)
- Backups: `~/.cc-switch/backups/` (auto-rotate, keep 10)

### Cloud Sync Setup

1. Go to Settings → &quot;Custom Configuration Directory&quot;
2. Choose your cloud sync folder (Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.)
3. Restart app to apply
4. Repeat on other devices to enable cross-device sync

&gt; **Note**: First launch auto-imports existing Claude/Codex configs as default provider.

```

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

**v3.6 Refactoring**

- Backend: 5-phase refactoring (error handling → command split → tests → services → concurrency)
- Frontend: 4-stage refactoring (test infra → hooks → components → cleanup)
- Testing: 100% hooks coverage + integration tests (vitest + MSW)
