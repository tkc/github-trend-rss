**The vector database that gets smarter the more you use it — and now ships as a cognitive container.**

```bash
npx ruvector
```

Most vector databases are static — they store embeddings and search them. That&#039;s it. RuVector is different: it learns from every query, runs LLMs locally, scales horizontally, boots as a Linux microservice from a single file, and costs nothing to operate.

|---|---|---|
| 🧠 **Search improves over time** | ❌ | ✅ The more you search, the better results get |
| 🤖 **Run LLMs locally** | ❌ | ✅ Run AI models on your own machine for free |

| 💰 **Cost** | Per-query pricing | ✅ Free forever — open source (MIT) |
| 📈 **Scales horizontally** | 💰 Paid tiers | ✅ Add nodes freely, no per-vector fees |
| 🌿 **Git-like branching** | ❌ | ✅ Branch your data like code — only changes are copied |
| ⚡ **Sublinear Solvers** | ❌ | ✅ O(log n) sparse linear systems, PageRank, spectral methods |
| 🔬 **Proof-Gated Graph Transformers** | ❌ | ✅ 8 verified modules: physics, bio, manifold, temporal, economic |

- **Source**: [examples/dna](./examples/dna)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RVF Cognitive Containers&lt;/strong&gt; — One file that stores, boots, and proves everything&lt;/summary&gt;

**[RVF (RuVector Format)](./crates/rvf/README.md)** is a universal binary substrate that merges database, model, graph engine, kernel, and attestation into a single deployable file. A `.rvf` file can store vector embeddings, carry LoRA adapter deltas, embed GNN graph state, include a bootable Linux microkernel, run queries in a 5.5 KB WASM runtime, and prove every operation through a cryptographic witness chain — all in one file that runs anywhere from a browser to bare metal.

This is not a database format. It is an **executable knowledge unit**.

```bash
cargo install rvf-cli                          # CLI tool
cargo add rvf-runtime                          # Rust library
npm install @ruvector/rvf                      # TypeScript SDK
npx @ruvector/rvf-mcp-server --transport stdio # MCP server for AI agents
```

| What It Does | How |
|---|---|
| Self-boot as a microservice | Real Linux kernel in the file, boots in 125 ms on QEMU/KVM |
| Hardware-speed lookups | eBPF programs (XDP, TC, socket filter) bypass userspace entirely |
| Run in any browser | 5.5 KB WASM runtime, zero backend |
| Git-like branching | COW at cluster granularity — 1M vectors, 100 edits = ~2.5 MB child |
| Tamper-evident audit | Hash-linked witness chain for every insert, query, and deletion |
| Post-quantum signatures | ML-DSA-65 and Ed25519 signing on every segment |
| DNA-style lineage | Parent/child derivation chains with cryptographic verification |
| 24 segment types | VEC, INDEX, KERNEL, EBPF, WASM, COW_MAP, WITNESS, CRYPTO, and 16 more |

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sublinear-Time Solver&lt;/strong&gt; — O(log n) sparse linear systems for graph analytics and AI&lt;/summary&gt;

**[ruvector-solver](./crates/ruvector-solver/README.md)** provides 8 iterative algorithms for sparse linear systems, achieving O(log n) to O(√n) complexity — orders of magnitude faster than dense O(n³) solvers. Powers Prime Radiant coherence, GNN message passing, spectral methods, and PageRank computation.

```bash
cargo add ruvector-solver --features all-algorithms
```

| Algorithm | Complexity | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|

| **TRUE** | O(log n) amortized | Large-scale Laplacian systems |
| **BMSSP** | O(nnz · log n) | Multigrid hierarchical solve |
| **Auto Router** | Automatic | Selects optimal algorithm |

**Key optimizations**: AVX2 SIMD SpMV, fused residual kernels, bounds-check elimination, arena allocator

## How the GNN Works

Traditional vector search:
```
Query → HNSW Index → Top K Results
```

RuVector with GNN:
```
Query → HNSW Index → GNN Layer → Enhanced Results
                ↑                      │
                └──── learns from ─────┘
```

The GNN layer:
1. Takes your query and its nearest neighbors
2. Applies multi-head attention to weigh which neighbors matter
3. Updates representations based on graph structure
4. Returns better-ranked results

Over time, frequently-accessed paths get reinforced, making common queries faster and more accurate.

 _The AI-native proxy server and data plane for agentic apps._&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Plano pulls out the rote plumbing work and decouples you from brittle framework abstractions, centralizing what shouldn’t be bespoke in every codebase - like agent routing and orchestration, rich agentic signals and traces for continuous improvement, guardrail filters for safety and moderation, and smart LLM routing APIs for model agility. Use any language or AI framework, and deliver agents faster to production.

# Overview
Building agentic demos is easy. Shipping agentic applications safely, reliably, and repeatably to production is hard. After the thrill of a quick hack, you end up building the “hidden middleware” to reach production: routing logic to reach the right agent, guardrail hooks for safety and moderation, evaluation and observability glue for continuous learning, and model/provider quirks scattered across frameworks and application code.

Plano solves this by moving core delivery concerns into a unified, out-of-process dataplane.

- **🚦 Orchestration:** Low-latency orchestration between agents; add new agents without modifying app code.
- **🔗 Model Agility:** Route [by model name, alias (semantic names) or automatically via preferences](#use-plano-as-a-llm-router).
- **🕵 Agentic Signals&amp;trade;:** Zero-code capture of [Signals](https://docs.planoai.dev/concepts/signals.html) plus OTEL traces/metrics across every agent.
- **🛡️ Moderation &amp; Memory Hooks:** Build jailbreak protection, add moderation policies and memory consistently via [Filter Chains](https://docs.planoai.dev/concepts/filter_chain.html).

Plano pulls rote plumbing out of your framework so you can stay focused on what matters most: the core product logic of your agentic applications. Plano is backed by [industry-leading LLM research](https://planoai.dev/research) and built on [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.io) by its core contributors, who built critical infrastructure at scale for modern worklaods.

**Jump to our [docs](https://docs.planoai.dev)** to learn how you can use Plano to improve the speed, safety and obervability of your agentic applications.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Plano and the Arch family of LLMs (like Plano-Orchestrator-4B, Arch-Router, etc) are hosted free of charge in the US-central region to give you a great first-run developer experience of Plano. To scale and run in production, you can either run these LLMs locally or contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pGZf2gcwEc) for API keys.

## Build Agentic Apps with Plano

Plano handles **orchestration, model management, and observability** as modular building blocks - letting you configure only what you need (edge proxying for agentic orchestration and guardrails, or LLM routing from your services, or both together) to fit cleanly into existing architectures. Below is a simple multi-agent travel agent built with Plano that showcases all three core capabilities

&gt; 📁 **Full working code:** See [`demos/agent_orchestration/travel_agents/`](demos/agent_orchestration/travel_agents/) for complete weather and flight agents you can run locally.



### 1. Define Your Agents in YAML

```yaml
# config.yaml
version: v0.3.0

# What you declare: Agent URLs and natural language descriptions
# What you don&#039;t write: Intent classifiers, routing logic, model fallbacks, provider adapters, or tracing instrumentation

agents:
  - id: weather_agent
    url: http://localhost:10510
  - id: flight_agent
    url: http://localhost:10520

model_providers:
  - model: openai/gpt-4o
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    default: true
  - model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet
    access_key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

listeners:
  - type: agent
    name: travel_assistant
    port: 8001
    router: plano_orchestrator_v1  # Powered by our 4B-parameter routing model. You can change this to different models
    agents:
      - id: weather_agent
        description: |
          Gets real-time weather and forecasts for any city worldwide.
          Handles: &quot;What&#039;s the weather in Paris?&quot;, &quot;Will it rain in Tokyo?&quot;

      - id: flight_agent
        description: |
          Searches flights between airports with live status and schedules.
          Handles: &quot;Flights from NYC to LA&quot;, &quot;Show me flights to Seattle&quot;

tracing:
  random_sampling: 100  # Auto-capture traces for evaluation
```

### 2. Write Simple Agent Code

Your agents are just HTTP servers that implement the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint. Use any language or framework:

```python
# weather_agent.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

app = FastAPI()

# Point to Plano&#039;s LLM gateway - it handles model routing for you
llm = AsyncOpenAI(base_url=&quot;http://localhost:12001/v1&quot;, api_key=&quot;EMPTY&quot;)

@app.post(&quot;/v1/chat/completions&quot;)
async def chat(request: Request):
    body = await request.json()
    messages = body.get(&quot;messages&quot;, [])
    days = 7

    # Your agent logic: fetch data, call APIs, run tools
    # See demos/agent_orchestration/travel_agents/ for the full implementation
    weather_data = await get_weather_data(request, messages, days)

    # Stream the response back through Plano
    async def generate():
        stream = await llm.chat.completions.create(
            model=&quot;openai/gpt-4o&quot;,
            messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: f&quot;Weather: {weather_data}&quot;}, *messages],
            stream=True
        )
        async for chunk in stream:
            yield f&quot;data: {chunk.model_dump_json()}\n\n&quot;

    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type=&quot;text/event-stream&quot;)
```

### 3. Start Plano &amp; Query Your Agents

**Prerequisites:** Follow the [prerequisites guide](https://docs.planoai.dev/get_started/quickstart.html#prerequisites) to install Plano and set up your environment.

```bash
# Start Plano
planoai up config.yaml
...

# Query - Plano intelligently routes to both agents in a single conversation
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
      {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I want to travel from NYC to Paris next week. What is the weather like there, and can you find me some flights?&quot;}
    ]
  }&#039;
# → Plano routes to weather_agent for Paris weather ✓
# → Then routes to flight_agent for NYC → Paris flights ✓
# → Returns a complete travel plan with both weather info and flight options
```

### 4. Get Observability and Model Agility for Free

Every request is traced end-to-end with OpenTelemetry - no instrumentation code needed.

![Atomatic Tracing](docs/source/_static/img/demo_tracing.png)

### What You Didn&#039;t Have to Build

| Infrastructure Concern | Without Plano | With Plano |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Agent Orchestration** | Write intent classifier + routing logic | Declare agent descriptions in YAML |
| **Model Management** | Handle each provider&#039;s API quirks | Unified LLM APIs with state management |
| **Rich Tracing** | Instrument every service with OTEL | Automatic end-to-end traces and logs |
| **Learning Signals** | Build pipeline to capture/export spans | Zero-code agentic signals |
| **Adding Agents** | Update routing code, test, redeploy | Add to config, restart |

**Why it&#039;s efficient:** Plano uses purpose-built, lightweight LLMs (like our 4B-parameter orchestrator) instead of heavyweight frameworks or GPT-4 for routing - giving you production-grade routing at a fraction of the cost and latency.

## Installation

The Wasmtime CLI can be installed on Linux and macOS (locally) with a small install
script:

```console
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```
This script installs into `$WASMTIME_HOME` (defaults to `$HOME/.wasmtime`), and executable is placed in `$WASMTIME_HOME/bin`.

After running the install script above, follow the on-screen instructions.

Windows or otherwise interested users can download installers and
binaries directly from the [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) page.

For additional installation options, refer to the [online book CLI installation page](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/cli-install.html).

Documentation on Wasmtime&#039;s currently supported versions can be found [in the
online book
documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html#current-versions).

## Example

If you&#039;ve got the [Rust compiler
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then you can take some Rust
source code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
```

and compile it into a WebAssembly component with:

```console
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
rustc hello.rs --target wasm32-wasip2
```

Once compiled, you can run your component:

```console
wasmtime hello.wasm
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Hello, world!
```

(Note: make sure you installed Rust using the [`rustup`][rustup] method in the official
instructions above, and do not have a copy of the Rust toolchain installed on
your system in some other way as well (e.g. the system package manager). Otherwise, the `rustup target add...`
command may not install the target for the correct copy of Rust.)

## Features

* **Fast**. Wasmtime is built on the optimizing [Cranelift] code generator to
  quickly generate high-quality machine code either at runtime or
  ahead-of-time. Wasmtime is optimized for efficient instantiation, low-overhead
  calls between the embedder and wasm, and scalability of concurrent instances.

* **[Secure]**. Wasmtime&#039;s development is strongly focused on correctness and
  security. Building on top of Rust&#039;s runtime safety guarantees, each Wasmtime
  feature goes through careful review and consideration via an [RFC
  process]. Once features are designed and implemented, they undergo 24/7
  fuzzing donated by [Google&#039;s OSS Fuzz]. As features stabilize they become part
  of a [release][release policy], and when things go wrong we have a
  well-defined [security policy] in place to quickly mitigate and patch any
  issues. We follow best practices for defense-in-depth and integrate
  protections and mitigations for issues like Spectre. Finally, we&#039;re working to
  push the state-of-the-art by collaborating with academic researchers to
  formally verify critical parts of Wasmtime and Cranelift.

* **[Configurable]**. Wasmtime uses sensible defaults, but can also be
  configured to provide more fine-grained control over things like CPU and
  memory consumption. Whether you want to run Wasmtime in a tiny environment or
  on massive servers with many concurrent instances, we&#039;ve got you covered.

* **[WASI]**. Wasmtime supports a rich set of APIs for interacting with the host
  environment through the [WASI standard](https://wasi.dev).

* **[Standards Compliant]**. Wasmtime passes the [official WebAssembly test
  suite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite), implements the [official C
  API of wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), and implements
  [future proposals to WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) as
  well. Wasmtime developers are intimately engaged with the WebAssembly
  standards process all along the way too.

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

ArtCraft
========
ArtCraft is the IDE for interactive AI image and video creation.
We turn prompting into *crafting*, so your ideas become a form of tangible expression and computing.
This is Adobe Photoshop for everyone, and we&#039;re giving away the source code!

## Show, Don&#039;t Tell: Advanced Crafting Features

Text-to-image is great, but artists *need control*. It&#039;s important to know what your image will look like before you generate it, and it&#039;s vitally important to achieve consistency and repeatability.

| Feature                           | Demo + Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Image to Location**             | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f103e3-cc19-4882-a630-9caa1b76ae31) Placing virtual actors into physical environments establishes single-location consistency. You can film multiple shots within a room without having things disappear.         |
| **3D Image Compositing**          | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f93a616f-571d-474e-bcc0-53736de7303d) Use images (backdrops, foreground elements, props, etc.) in scenes with depth and blend them naturally together. Just a couple of images usually leads to great compositions. |
| **2D Image Compositing**          | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f99391-e496-4c62-9e37-29734ba5f899) Use images, background removal, layers, and simple drawing tools to precisely compose a scene.                                                                                |
| **Image to 3D Mesh**              | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/600a405c-e360-48c1-9b42-6e657ae6243b) It&#039;s almost impossible to lay out complicated objects or block complicated scenes; turning images into 3D helps position elements exactingly and intentionally.               |
| **Character Posing**              | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52a8e983-7c8f-42d2-be8b-25296ab9ed57) You can dynamically pose your characters to achieve the precise character, scene, and camera blocking before calling &quot;action&quot;.                                                |
| **Scene Blocking w/ Kit Bashing** | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eef025ac-0346-4a46-a023-d48e23629eb5) Use 3D asset kits to precisely block out your scene: get the correct angles, object positions, and rich depth layering you can&#039;t with text prompting.                         |
| **Character Identity Transfer**   | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629119ee-8c76-4a83-9827-8c6c995a3ec1) Use mannequins as simple 3D ControlNets for posing any character.                                                                                                             |
| **Background Removal**            | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c65057-5531-404f-83af-b34e66e24ec1) Remove backgrounds from images to make them useful in 2D or 3D compositing. They can be props, layers, or backdrops.                                                          |
| **Mixed Asset Crafting**          | ![Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storytold/github-media/main/ship-editing.gif) You can use image cutouts, worlds, and simple 3D meshes all together to precisely and intentionally lay out your scenes.                                                       |
| **Scene Blocking**                | (preview coming soon)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Scene Relighting**              | (preview coming soon)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Note: all of the above videos were generated for free with Grok Video; the cost to build this README was negligible.

## Quick and Easy Prompting
We haven&#039;t abandoned text-to-asset generation for quick prototyping and ideation. We support every popular workflow in a first class fashion.

We&#039;re going to be adding the following providers soon: Kling (via Kling website accounts), Google (via API keys), 
Runway (via website account), Luma (via website account).

We&#039;re potentially interested in adding other aggregators for those who already have subscriptions and credits at 
those providers, for example: OpenArt, FreePik, etc.

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the snippet below into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

```

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

**v3.6 Refactoring**

- Backend: 5-phase refactoring (error handling → command split → tests → services → concurrency)
- Frontend: 4-stage refactoring (test infra → hooks → components → cleanup)
- Testing: 100% hooks coverage + integration tests (vitest + MSW)

[![CI](https://github.com/levkk/pgdog/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/levkk/pgdog/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

PgDog is a proxy for scaling PostgreSQL. It supports connection pooling, load balancing queries and sharding entire databases. Written in Rust, PgDog is fast, secure and can manage thousands of connections on commodity hardware.

## Documentation

&amp;#128216; PgDog documentation can be **[found here](https://docs.pgdog.dev/)**. Any questions? Chat with us on **[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/CcBZkjSJdd)**.

## Quick start

### Kubernetes

Helm chart is **[here](https://github.com/pgdogdev/helm)**. To install it, run:

```bash
helm repo add pgdogdev https://helm.pgdog.dev
helm install pgdog pgdogdev/pgdog
```

### AWS

If you&#039;re using AWS RDS, you can deploy PgDog using one of two supported methods:

1. [Helm chart](https://github.com/pgdogdev/helm) with [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), or a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster
2. [Terraform module](https://github.com/pgdogdev/pgdog-ecs-terraform) to deploy PgDog on [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)

### Try in Docker

You can try PgDog quickly using Docker. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

Once started, you can connect to PgDog with psql or any other PostgreSQL client:

```
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6432 -U postgres
```

The demo comes with 3 shards and 2 sharded tables:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email) VALUES (1, &#039;admin@acme.com&#039;);
INSERT INTO payments (id, user_id, amount) VALUES (1, 1, 100.0);

SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM payments WHERE user_id = 1;
```

## Features

&amp;#128216; **[Configuration](https://docs.pgdog.dev/configuration/)**

All PgDog features are configurable and can be turned on and off. PgDog requires 2 configuration files to operate:

1. `pgdog.toml`: hosts, sharding configuration, and other settings
2. `users.toml`: usernames and passwords

### Example

Most options have reasonable defaults, so a basic configuration for a single user
and database running on the same machine is pretty short:

**`pgdog.toml`**

```toml
[general]
port = 6432
default_pool_size = 10

[[databases]]
name = &quot;pgdog&quot;
host = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
```

**`users.toml`**

```toml
[[users]]
name = &quot;alice&quot;
database = &quot;pgdog&quot;
password = &quot;hunter2&quot;
```

If a database in `pgdog.toml` doesn&#039;t have a user in `users.toml`, the connection pool for that database will not be created and users won&#039;t be able to connect.

If you&#039;d like to try it out locally, create the database and user like so:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE pgdog;
CREATE USER pgdog PASSWORD &#039;pgdog&#039; LOGIN;
```

### Transaction pooling

&amp;#128216; **[Transactions](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/transaction-mode)**

Like PgBouncer, PgDog supports transaction (and session) pooling, allowing
thousands of clients to use just a few PostgreSQL server connections.

Unlike PgBouncer, PgDog can parse and handle `SET` statements and startup options, ensuring session state is set correctly when sharing server connections between clients with different parameters.

PgDog also has more advanced connection recovery options, like automatic abandoned transaction rollbacks and connection re-synchronization to avoid churning server connections during an application crash.

### Load balancer

&amp;#128216; **[Load balancer](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/load-balancer/)**

PgDog is an application layer (OSI Level 7) load balancer for PostgreSQL. It understands the Postgres protocol, can proxy multiple replicas (and primary) and distributes transactions evenly between databases. The load balancer supports 3 strategies: round robin, random and least active connections.


**Example**

The load balancer is enabled automatically when a database has more than one host:

```toml
[[databases]]
name = &quot;prod&quot;
host = &quot;10.0.0.1&quot;
role = &quot;primary&quot;

[[databases]]
name = &quot;prod&quot;
host = &quot;10.0.0.2&quot;
role = &quot;replica&quot;
```

#### Health checks

&amp;#128216; **[Healthchecks](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/load-balancer/healthchecks/)**


PgDog maintains a real-time list of healthy hosts. When a database fails a health check, it&#039;s removed from the active rotation and queries are re-routed to other replicas. This works like an HTTP load balancer, except it&#039;s for your database.

Health checks maximize database availability and protect against bad network connections, temporary hardware failures or misconfiguration.


#### Single endpoint

&amp;#128216; **[Single endpoint](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/load-balancer/#single-endpoint)**


PgDog uses [`pg_query`](https://github.com/pganalyze/pg_query.rs), which includes the PostgreSQL native parser. By parsing queries, PgDog can detect writes (e.g. `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE TABLE`, etc.) and send them to the primary, leaving the replicas to serve reads (`SELECT`). This allows applications to connect to the same PgDog deployment for both reads and writes.


##### Transactions

&amp;#128216; **[Load balancer &amp; transactions](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/load-balancer/transactions/)**


Transactions can execute multiple statements, so in a primary &amp; replica configuration, PgDog routes them to the primary. Clients can indicate a transaction is read-only, in which case PgDog will send it to a replica:

```sql
BEGIN READ ONLY;
-- This goes to a replica.
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1;
COMMIT;
```


#### Failover

&amp;#128216; **[Failover](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/load-balancer/replication-failover/)**


PgDog monitors Postgres replication state and can automatically redirect writes to a different database if a replica is promoted. This doesn&#039;t replace tools like Patroni that actually orchestrate failovers. You can use PgDog alongside Patroni (or AWS RDS or other managed Postgres host), to gracefully failover live traffic.


**Example**

To enable failover, set all database `role` attributes to `auto` and enable replication monitoring (`lsn_check_delay` setting):

```toml
[general]
lsn_check_delay = 0

[[databases]]
name = &quot;prod&quot;
host = &quot;10.0.0.1&quot;
role = &quot;auto&quot;

[[databases]]
name = &quot;prod&quot;
host = &quot;10.0.0.2&quot;
role = &quot;auto&quot;
```

### Sharding

&amp;#128216; **[Sharding](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/)**

PgDog is able to manage databases with multiple shards. By using the PostgreSQL parser, PgDog extracts sharding keys and determines the best routing strategy for each query.

For cross-shard queries, PgDog assembles and transforms results in memory, sending all rows to the client as if they are coming from a single database.

**Example**

Configuring multiple hosts for the same database with different shard numbers (`shard` setting) enables sharding:

```toml
[[databases]]
name = &quot;prod&quot;
host = &quot;10.0.0.1&quot;
shard = 0

[[databases]]
name = &quot;prod&quot;
host = &quot;10.0.0.2&quot;
shard = 1
```

Note: read below for how to configure query routing. At least one sharded table is required for sharding to work as expected.

#### Sharding functions

&amp;#128216; **[Sharding functions](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/sharding-functions/)**

PgDog has two main sharding algorithms:

1. PostgreSQL partition functions (`HASH`, `LIST`, `RANGE`)
2. Using schemas

##### Partition-based sharding

Partition-based sharding functions are taken directly from Postgres source code. This choice intentionally allows to shard data both with PgDog and with Postgres [foreign tables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createforeigntable.html) and [`postgres_fdw`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/postgres-fdw.html).

**Examples**

The `PARTITION BY HASH` algorithm is used by default when configuring sharded tables:

```toml
[[sharded_tables]]
database = &quot;prod&quot;
column = &quot;user_id&quot;
```

List-based sharding (same as `PARTITION BY LIST` in Postgres) can be configured as follows:

```toml
# Sharded table definition still required.
[[sharded_tables]]
database = &quot;prod&quot;
column = &quot;user_id&quot;

# Value-specific shard mappings.
[[sharded_mapping]]
database = &quot;prod&quot;
column = &quot;user_id&quot;
values = [1, 2, 3, 4]
shard = 0

[[sharded_mapping]]
database = &quot;prod&quot;
column = &quot;user_id&quot;
values = [5, 6, 7, 8]
shard = 1
```

For range-based sharding, replace the `values` setting with a range, for example:

```toml
start = 0 # include
end = 5 # exclusive
```

##### Schema-based sharding

&amp;#128216; **[Schema-based sharding](https://docs.pgdog.dev/configuration/pgdog.toml/sharded_schemas/)**

Schema-based sharding works on the basis of PostgreSQL schemas. Tables under the same schema are placed on the same shard and all queries that refer to those tables are routed to that shard automatically.

**Example**

Configuring sharded schemas uses a different configuration from sharded tables:

```toml
[[sharded_schemas]]
database = &quot;prod&quot;
name = &quot;customer_a&quot;
shard = 0

[[sharded_schemas]]
database = &quot;prod&quot;
name = &quot;customer_b&quot;
shard = 1
```

Queries that refer tables in schema `customer_a` will be sent to shard 0. For example, a query that refers to a table by its fully-qualified name will be sent to one shard only:

```sql
INSERT INTO customer_a.orders (id, user_id, amount)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3);
```

Alternatively, the schema name can be specified in the `search_path` session variable:

```sql
SET search_path TO public, customer_a;
-- All subsequent queries will be sent to shard 0.
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 1;
```

You can also set the `search_path` for the duration of a single transaction, using `SET LOCAL`, ensuring only that transaction is sent to the desired shard:

```sql
-- The entire transaction will be sent to shard 1.
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL search_path TO public, customer_b;
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 1;
COMMIT;
```

#### Direct-to-shard queries

&amp;#128216; **[Direct-to-shard queries](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/query-routing/)**


Queries that contain a sharding key are sent to one database only. This is the best case scenario for sharded databases, since the load is uniformly distributed across the cluster.

**Example**:

```sql
-- user_id is the sharding key.
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = $1;
```

#### Cross-shard queries

- &amp;#128216; **[Cross-shard queries](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/cross-shard-queries/)**
- &amp;#128216; **[SELECT](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/cross-shard-queries/select/)**
- &amp;#128216; **[INSERT](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/cross-shard-queries/insert/)**
- &amp;#128216; **[UPDATE and DELETE](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/cross-shard-queries/update/)**
- &amp;#128216; **[DDL](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/cross-shard-queries/ddl/)**

Queries with multiple sharding keys or without one are sent to all databases and results are post-processed and assembled in memory. PgDog then sends the final result to the client.

Currently, support for certain SQL features in cross-shard queries is limited. However, the list of supported ones keeps growing:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| Aggregates | Partial | `count`, `min`, `max`, `stddev`, `variance`, `sum`, `avg` are supported. |
| `ORDER BY` | Partial | Column in `ORDER BY` clause must be present in the result set. |
| `GROUP BY` | Partial | Same as `ORDER BY`, referenced columns must be present in result set. |
| Multi-tuple `INSERT` | Supported | PgDog generates one statement per tuple and executes them automatically. |
| Sharding key `UPDATE` | Supported | PgDog generates a `SELECT`, `INSERT` and `DELETE` statements and execute them automatically. |
| Subqueries | No | The same subquery is executed on all shards. |
| CTEs | No | The same CTE is executed on all shards. |


#### Using `COPY`

&amp;#128216; **[Copy](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/cross-shard-queries/copy/)**

PgDog has a text, CSV &amp; binary parser and can split rows sent via `COPY` command between all shards automatically. This allows clients to ingest data into sharded PostgreSQL without preprocessing

**Example**

```sql
COPY orders (id, user_id, amount) FROM STDIN CSV HEADER;
```

Columns must be specified in the `COPY` statement, so PgDog can infer the sharding key automatically, but are optional in the data file.


#### Consistency (two-phase commit)

&amp;#128216; **[Two-phase commit](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/2pc/)**

To make sure cross-shard writes are atomic, PgDog supports Postgres&#039; [two-phase transactions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/two-phase.html). When enabled, PgDog handles `COMMIT` statements sent by clients by executing the 2pc exchange on their behalf:

```sql
PREPARE TRANSACTION &#039;__pgdog_unique_id&#039;;
COMMIT PREPARED &#039;__pgdog_unique_id&#039;;
```

In case the client disconnects or Postgres crashes, PgDog will automatically rollback the transaction if it&#039;s in phase I and commit it if it&#039;s in phase II.

#### Unique identifiers

&amp;#128216; **[Unique IDs](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/unique-ids/)**

While applications can use `UUID` (v4 and now v7) to generate unique primary keys, PgDog supports creating unique `BIGINT` identifiers, without using a sequence:

```sql
SELECT pgdog.unique_id();
```

This uses a timestamp-based algorithm, can produce millions of unique numbers per second and doesn&#039;t require an expensive cross-shard index to guarantee uniqueness.

#### Shard key updates

PgDog supports changing the sharding key for a row online. Under the hood, it will execute 3 statements to make it happen:

1. `SELECT` to get the entire row from its original shard
2. `INSERT` to write the new, changed row to the new shard
3. `DELETE` to remove it from the old shard

This happens automatically, and the client can retrieve the new row as normal:

```sql
UPDATE orders SET user_id = 5 WHERE user_id = 1 RETURNING *;
-- This will return the new row
```

Note: Only one row can be updated at a time and if a query attempts to update multiple, PgDog will abort the transaction.

To enable shard key updates, add this to `pgdog.toml`:

```toml
[rewrite]
enabled = true
shard_key = &quot;rewrite&quot; # options: ignore (possible data loss), error (block shard key update)
```

#### Multi-tuple inserts

PgDog can handle multi-tuple `INSERT` queries by sending each tuple to the right shard, e.g.:

```sql
INSERT INTO payments
    (id, user_id, amount) -- user_id is the sharding key
VALUES
(pgdog.unique_id(), 1, 25.00), -- Tuples go to different shards
(pgdog.unique_id(), 5, 55.0); -- Each tuple gets a unique primary key because unique ID function is invoked twice
```

This happens automatically, if enabled:

```toml
[rewrite]
enabled = true
split_inserts = &quot;rewrite&quot; # other options: ignore, error
```

#### Re-sharding

- &amp;#128216; **[Re-sharding](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/resharding/)**
- &amp;#128216; **[Schema sync](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/resharding/schema/)**
- &amp;#128216; **[Data sync](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/sharding/resharding/hash/)**

PgDog understands the PostgreSQL logical replication protocol and can orchestrate data splits between databases, in the background and without downtime. This allows to shard existing databases and add more shards to existing clusters in production, without impacting database operations.

The re-sharding process is done in 5 steps:

1. Create new empty cluster with the desired number of shards
2. Configure it in `pgdog.toml` and run `schema-sync` command to copy table schemas to the new databases
3. Run `data-sync` command to copy and re-shard table data with logical replication (tables are copied in parallel)
4. While keeping previous command running (it streams row updates in real-time), run `schema-sync --data-sync-complete` to create secondary indexes on the new databases (much faster to do this after data is copied)
5. Cutover traffic to new cluster with `MAINTENANCE ON`, `RELOAD`, `MAINTENANCE OFF` command sequence

Cutover can be done atomically with multiple PgDog containers because `RELOAD` doesn&#039;t resume traffic, `MAINTENANCE OFF` does, so the config is the same in all containers before queries are resumed. No complex synchronization tooling like etcd or  Zookeeper is required.

### Monitoring

&amp;#128216; **[Metrics](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/metrics/)**

PgDog exposes both the standard PgBouncer-style admin database and an OpenMetrics endpoint. The admin database isn&#039;t 100% compatible,
so we recommend you use OpenMetrics for monitoring. Example Datadog configuration and dashboard are [included](examples/datadog).


## Running PgDog locally

Install the latest version of the Rust compiler from [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org).
Clone this repository and build the project in release mode:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

It&#039;s important to use the release profile if you&#039;re deploying to production or want to run
performance benchmarks.

#### Try sharding

Sharded database clusters are set in the config. For example, to set up a 2 shard cluster, you can:

**`pgdog.toml`**

```toml
[[databases]]
name = &quot;pgdog_sharded&quot;
host = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
database_name = &quot;shard_0&quot;
shard = 0

[[databases]]
name = &quot;pgdog_sharded&quot;
host = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
database_name = &quot;shard_1&quot;
shard = 1

[[sharded_tables]]
database = &quot;pgdog_sharded&quot;
column = &quot;user_id&quot;
```

Don&#039;t forget to configure a user:

**`users.toml`**

```toml
[[users]]
database = &quot;pgdog_sharded&quot;
name = &quot;pgdog&quot;
password = &quot;pgdog&quot;
```

And finally, to make it work locally, create the required databases:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shard_0;
CREATE DATABASE shard_1;

GRANT ALL ON DATABASE shard_0 TO pgdog;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE shard_1 TO pgdog;
```

### Start PgDog

Running PgDog can be done with Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

#### Command-line options

PgDog supports several command-line options:

- `-c, --config &lt;CONFIG&gt;`: Path to the configuration file (default: `&quot;pgdog.toml&quot;`)
- `-u, --users &lt;USERS&gt;`: Path to the users.toml file (default: `&quot;users.toml&quot;`)
- `-d, --database_url &lt;DATABASE_URL&gt;`: Connection URL(s). Can be specified multiple times to add multiple database connections. When provided, these URLs override database configurations from the config file.

Example using database URLs directly:

```bash
cargo run --release -- -d postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db1 -d postgres://user:pass@localhost:5433/db2
```

You can connect to PgDog with `psql` or any other PostgreSQL client:

```bash
psql postgres://pgdog:pgdog@127.0.0.1:6432/pgdog
```

## &amp;#128678; Status &amp;#128678;

PgDog is used in production and at scale. Most features are stable, while some are experimental. Check [documentation](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/) for more details. New sharding features are added almost weekly.

## Performance

&amp;#128216; **[Architecture &amp; benchmarks](https://docs.pgdog.dev/architecture/)**

PgDog is heavily optimized for performance. We use Rust, [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/), [bytes crate](https://docs.rs/bytes/latest/bytes/) to avoid unnecessary memory allocations, and profile for performance regressions on a regular basis.

## License

PgDog is free and open source software, licensed under the AGPL v3. While often misunderstood, this license is very permissive
and allows the following without any additional requirements from you or your organization:

* Internal use
* Private modifications for internal use without sharing any source code

You can freely use PgDog to power your PostgreSQL databases without having to
share any source code, including proprietary work product or any PgDog modifications you make.

AGPL was written specifically for organizations that offer PgDog _as a public service_ (e.g. database cloud providers) and require
those organizations to share any modifications they make to PgDog, including new features and bug fixes.

&lt;hr /&gt;

Lance is an open lakehouse format for multimodal AI. It contains a file format, table format, and catalog spec that allows you to build a complete lakehouse on top of object storage to power your AI workflows. Lance is perfect for:

1. Building search engines and feature stores with hybrid search capabilities.
2. Large-scale ML training requiring high performance IO and random access.
3. Storing, querying, and managing multimodal data including images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings.

The key features of Lance include:

* **Expressive hybrid search:** Combine vector similarity search, full-text search (BM25), and SQL analytics on the same dataset with accelerated secondary indices.

* **Lightning-fast random access:** 100x faster than Parquet or Iceberg for random access without sacrificing scan performance.

* **Native multimodal data support:** Store images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings in a single unified format with efficient blob encoding and lazy loading.

* **Data evolution:** Efficiently add columns with backfilled values without full table rewrites, perfect for ML feature engineering.

* **Zero-copy versioning:** Automatic versioning with ACID transactions, time travel, tags, and branches—no extra infrastructure needed.

* **Rich ecosystem integrations:** Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Apache Spark, Ray, Trino, Apache Flink, and open catalogs (Apache Polaris, Unity Catalog, Apache Gravitino).

For more details, see the full [Lance format specification](https://lance.org/format).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Lance is in active development and we welcome contributions. Please see our [contributing guide](https://lance.org/community/contributing/) for more information.

## Quick Start

**Installation**

```shell
pip install pylance
```

To install a preview release:

```shell
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lance-format/pylance
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; For versions prior to 1.0.0-beta.4, you can find them at https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/pylance

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Preview releases are released more often than full releases and contain the
&gt; latest features and bug fixes. They receive the same level of testing as full releases.
&gt; We guarantee they will remain published and available for download for at
&gt; least 6 months. When you want to pin to a specific version, prefer a stable release.

**Converting to Lance**

```python
import lance

import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.dataset

df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;a&quot;: [5], &quot;b&quot;: [10]})
uri = &quot;/tmp/test.parquet&quot;
tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
pa.dataset.write_dataset(tbl, uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)

parquet = pa.dataset.dataset(uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)
lance.write_dataset(parquet, &quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
```

**Reading Lance data**
```python
dataset = lance.dataset(&quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
assert isinstance(dataset, pa.dataset.Dataset)
```

**Pandas**
```python
df = dataset.to_table().to_pandas()
df
```

**DuckDB**
```python
import duckdb

# If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM dataset LIMIT 10&quot;).to_df()
```

**Vector search**

Download the sift1m subset

```shell
wget ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz
tar -xzf sift.tar.gz
```

Convert it to Lance

```python
import lance
from lance.vector import vec_to_table
import numpy as np
import struct

nvecs = 1000000
ndims = 128
with open(&quot;sift/sift_base.fvecs&quot;, mode=&quot;rb&quot;) as fobj:
    buf = fobj.read()
    data = np.array(struct.unpack(&quot;&lt;128000000f&quot;, buf[4 : 4 + 4 * nvecs * ndims])).reshape((nvecs, ndims))
    dd = dict(zip(range(nvecs), data))

table = vec_to_table(dd)
uri = &quot;vec_data.lance&quot;
sift1m = lance.write_dataset(table, uri, max_rows_per_group=8192, max_rows_per_file=1024*1024)
```

Build the index

```python
sift1m.create_index(&quot;vector&quot;,
                    index_type=&quot;IVF_PQ&quot;,
                    num_partitions=256,  # IVF
                    num_sub_vectors=16)  # PQ
```

Search the dataset

```python
# Get top 10 similar vectors
import duckdb

dataset = lance.dataset(uri)

# Sample 100 query vectors. If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
sample = duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT vector FROM dataset USING SAMPLE 100&quot;).to_df()
query_vectors = np.array([np.array(x) for x in sample.vector])

# Get nearest neighbors for all of them
rs = [dataset.to_table(nearest={&quot;column&quot;: &quot;vector&quot;, &quot;k&quot;: 10, &quot;q&quot;: q})
      for q in query_vectors]
```

## Directory structure

| Directory          | Description              |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| [rust](./rust)     | Core Rust implementation |

| [java](./java)     | Java bindings (JNI)      |
| [docs](./docs)     | Documentation source     |

## Benchmarks

### Vector search

We used the SIFT dataset to benchmark our results with 1M vectors of 128D

1. For 100 randomly sampled query vectors, we get &lt;1ms average response time (on a 2023 m2 MacBook Air)

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/avg_latency.png)

2. ANNs are always a trade-off between recall and performance

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/recall_vs_latency.png)

### Vs. parquet

We create a Lance dataset using the Oxford Pet dataset to do some preliminary performance testing of Lance as compared to Parquet and raw image/XMLs. For analytics queries, Lance is 50-100x better than reading the raw metadata. For batched random access, Lance is 100x better than both parquet and raw files.

![](docs/src/images/lance_perf.png)

## Why Lance for AI/ML workflows?

The machine learning development cycle involves multiple stages:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --&gt; B[Exploration];
    B --&gt; C[Analytics];
    C --&gt; D[Feature Engineer];
    D --&gt; E[Training];
    E --&gt; F[Evaluation];
    F --&gt; C;
    E --&gt; G[Deployment];
    G --&gt; H[Monitoring];
    H --&gt; A;
```

Traditional lakehouse formats were designed for SQL analytics and struggle with AI/ML workloads that require:
- **Vector search** for similarity and semantic retrieval
- **Fast random access** for sampling and interactive exploration
- **Multimodal data** storage (images, videos, audio alongside embeddings)
- **Data evolution** for feature engineering without full table rewrites
- **Hybrid search** combining vectors, full-text, and SQL predicates

While existing formats (Parquet, Iceberg, Delta Lake) excel at SQL analytics, they require additional specialized systems for AI capabilities. Lance brings these AI-first features directly into the lakehouse format.

A comparison of different formats across ML development stages:

|                     | Lance | Parquet &amp; ORC | JSON &amp; XML | TFRecord | Database | Warehouse |
|---------------------|-------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Analytics           | Fast  | Fast          | Slow       | Slow     | Decent   | Fast      |
| Feature Engineering | Fast  | Fast          | Decent     | Slow     | Decent   | Good      |
| Training            | Fast  | Decent        | Slow       | Fast     | N/A      | N/A       |
| Exploration         | Fast  | Slow          | Fast       | Slow     | Fast     | Decent    |
| Infra Support       | Rich  | Rich          | Decent     | Limited  | Rich     | Rich      |

自动检测操作系统、架构和包管理器，一条命令完成下载与安装。

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/v4.1.23/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

&gt; **支持的格式**: Linux (`.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage`) | macOS (`.dmg`) | Windows (NSIS `.exe`)
&gt;
&gt; **高级用法**: 安装指定版本 `curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --version 4.1.23`，预览模式 `curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --dry-run`

#### macOS - Homebrew
如果您已安装 [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)，也可以通过以下命令安装：

```bash
# 1. 订阅本仓库的 Tap
brew tap lbjlaq/antigravity-manager https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager

# 2. 安装应用
brew install --cask antigravity-tools
```
&gt; **提示**: 如果遇到权限问题，建议添加 `--no-quarantine` 参数。

#### Arch Linux
您可以选择通过一键安装脚本或 Homebrew 进行安装：

**方式 1：一键安装脚本 (推荐)**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/main/deploy/arch/install.sh | bash
```

**方式 2：通过 Homebrew** (如果您已安装 [Linuxbrew](https://sh.brew.sh/))
```bash
brew tap lbjlaq/antigravity-manager https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager
brew install --cask antigravity-tools
```

#### 其他 Linux 发行版
安装后会自动将 AppImage 添加到二进制路径并配置可执行权限。

### 选项 B: 手动下载
前往 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/releases) 下载对应系统的包：
*   **macOS**: `.dmg` (支持 Apple Silicon &amp; Intel)
*   **Windows**: `.msi` 或 便携版 `.zip`
*   **Linux**: `.deb` 或 `AppImage`

### 选项 C: Docker 部署 (推荐用于 NAS/服务器)
如果您希望在容器化环境中运行，我们提供了原生的 Docker 镜像。该镜像内置了对 v4.0.2 原生 Headless 架构的支持，可自动托管前端静态资源，并通过浏览器直接进行管理。

```bash
# 方式 1: 直接运行 (推荐)
# - API_KEY: 必填。用于所有协议的 AI 请求鉴定。
# - WEB_PASSWORD: 可选。用于管理后台登录。若不设置则默认使用 API_KEY。
docker run -d --name antigravity-manager \
  -p 8045:8045 \
  -e API_KEY=sk-your-api-key \
  -e WEB_PASSWORD=your-login-password \
  -e ABV_MAX_BODY_SIZE=104857600 \
  -v ~/.antigravity_tools:/root/.antigravity_tools \
  lbjlaq/antigravity-manager:latest

# 忘记密钥？执行 docker logs antigravity-manager 或 grep -E &#039;&quot;api_key&quot;|&quot;admin_password&quot;&#039; ~/.antigravity_tools/gui_config.json

#### 🔐 鉴权逻辑说明
*   **场景 A：仅设置了 `API_KEY`**
    - **Web 登录**：使用 `API_KEY` 进入后台。
    - **API 调用**：使用 `API_KEY` 进行 AI 请求鉴权。
*   **场景 B：同时设置了 `API_KEY` 和 `WEB_PASSWORD` (推荐)**
    - **Web 登录**：**必须**使用 `WEB_PASSWORD`，使用 API Key 将被拒绝（更安全）。
    - **API 调用**：统一使用 `API_KEY`。这样您可以将 API Key 分发给成员，而保留密码仅供管理员使用。

#### 🆙 旧版本升级指引
如果您是从 v4.0.1 及更早版本升级，系统默认未设置 `WEB_PASSWORD`。您可以通过以下任一方式设置：
1.  **Web UI 界面 (推荐)**：使用原有 `API_KEY` 登录后，在 **API 反代设置** 页面手动设置并保存。新密码将持久化存储在 `gui_config.json` 中。
2.  **环境变量 (Docker)**：在启动容器时增加 `-e WEB_PASSWORD=您的新密码`。**注意：环境变量具有最高优先级，将覆盖 UI 中的任何修改。**
3.  **配置文件 (持久化)**：直接修改 `~/.antigravity_tools/gui_config.json`，在 `proxy` 对象中修改或添加 `&quot;admin_password&quot;: &quot;您的新密码&quot;` 字段。
    - *注：`WEB_PASSWORD` 是环境变量名，`admin_password` 是配置文件中的 JSON 键名。*

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **密码优先级逻辑 (Priority)**:
&gt; - **第一优先级 (环境变量)**: `ABV_WEB_PASSWORD` 或 `WEB_PASSWORD`。只要设置了环境变量，系统将始终使用它。
&gt; - **第二优先级 (配置文件)**: `gui_config.json` 中的 `admin_password` 字段。UI 的“保存”操作会更新此值。
&gt; - **保底回退 (向后兼容)**: 若上述均未设置，则回退使用 `API_KEY` 作为登录密码。

# 方式 2: 使用 Docker Compose
# 1. 进入项目的 docker 目录
cd docker
# 2. 启动服务
docker compose up -d
```
&gt; **访问地址**: `http://localhost:8045` (管理后台) | `http://localhost:8045/v1` (API Base)
&gt; **系统要求**:
&gt; - **内存**: 建议 **1GB** (最小 256MB)。
&gt; - **持久化**: 需挂载 `/root/.antigravity_tools` 以保存数据。
&gt; - **架构**: 支持 x86_64 和 ARM64。
&gt; **详情见**: [Docker 部署指南 (docker)](./docker/README.md)

### 🛠️ 常见问题排查 (Troubleshooting)

#### macOS 提示“应用已损坏，无法打开”？
由于 macOS 的安全机制，非 App Store 下载的应用可能会触发此提示。您可以按照以下步骤快速修复：

1.  **命令行修复** (推荐):
    打开终端，执行以下命令：
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine &quot;/Applications/Antigravity Tools.app&quot;
    ```
2.  **Homebrew 安装技巧**:
    如果您使用 brew 安装，可以添加 `--no-quarantine` 参数来规避此问题：
    ```bash
    brew install --cask --no-quarantine antigravity-tools
    ```

## 🔌 快速接入示例

### 🔐 OAuth 授权流程（添加账号）
1. 打开“Accounts / 账号” → “添加账号” → “OAuth”。
2. 弹窗会在点击按钮前预生成授权链接；点击链接即可复制到系统剪贴板，然后用你希望的浏览器打开并完成授权。
3. 授权完成后浏览器会打开本地回调页并显示“✅ 授权成功!”。
4. 应用会自动继续完成授权并保存账号；如未自动完成，可点击“我已授权，继续”手动完成。

&gt; 提示：授权链接包含一次性回调端口，请始终使用弹窗里生成的最新链接；如果授权时应用未运行或弹窗已关闭，浏览器可能会提示 `localhost refused connection`。

### 如何接入 Claude Code CLI?
1.  启动 Antigravity，并在“API 反代”页面开启服务。
2.  在终端执行：
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045&quot;
claude
```

### 如何接入 OpenCode?
1.  进入 **API 反代**页面 → **外部 Providers** → 点击 **OpenCode Sync** 卡片。
2.  点击 **Sync** 按钮，将自动生成 `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` 配置文件：
    - 创建独立 provider `antigravity-manager`（不覆盖 google/anthropic 原生配置）
    - 可选：勾选 **Sync accounts** 导出 `antigravity-accounts.json`（plugin-compatible v3 格式），供 OpenCode 插件直接导入
3.  点击 **Clear Config** 可一键清除 Manager 配置并清理 legacy 残留；点击 **Restore** 可从备份恢复。
4.  Windows 用户路径为 `C:\Users\&lt;用户名&gt;\.config\opencode\`（与 `~/.config/opencode` 规则一致）。

**快速验证命令：**
```bash
# 测试 antigravity-manager provider（支持 --variant）
opencode run &quot;test&quot; --model antigravity-manager/claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking --variant high

# 若已安装 opencode-antigravity-auth 插件，验证 google provider 仍可独立工作
opencode run &quot;test&quot; --model google/antigravity-claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking --variant max
```

### 如何接入 Kilo Code?
1.  **协议选择**: 建议优先使用 **Gemini 协议**。
2.  **Base URL**: 填写 `http://127.0.0.1:8045`。
3.  **注意**: 
    - **OpenAI 协议限制**: Kilo Code 在使用 OpenAI 模式时，其请求路径会叠加产生 `/v1/chat/completions/responses` 这种非标准路径，导致 Antigravity 返回 404。因此请务必填入 Base URL 后选择 Gemini 模式。
    - **模型映射**: Kilo Code 中的模型名称可能与 Antigravity 默认设置不一致，如遇到无法连接，请在“模型映射”页面设置自定义映射，并查看**日志文件**进行调试。

### 如何在 Python 中使用?
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;,
    base_url=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1&quot;
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-flash&quot;,
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;你好，请自我介绍&quot;}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 如何使用图片生成 (Imagen 3)?

#### 方式一：OpenAI Images API (推荐)
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;,
    base_url=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1&quot;
)

# 生成图片
response = client.images.generate(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    prompt=&quot;一座未来主义风格的城市，赛博朋克，霓虹灯&quot;,
    size=&quot;1920x1080&quot;,      # 支持任意 WIDTHxHEIGHT 格式，自动计算宽高比
    quality=&quot;hd&quot;,          # &quot;standard&quot; | &quot;hd&quot; | &quot;medium&quot;
    n=1,
    response_format=&quot;b64_json&quot;
)

# 保存图片
import base64
image_data = base64.b64decode(response.data[0].b64_json)
with open(&quot;output.png&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;) as f:
    f.write(image_data)
```

**支持的参数**：
- **`size`**: 任意 `WIDTHxHEIGHT` 格式（如 `1280x720`, `1024x1024`, `1920x1080`），自动计算并映射到标准宽高比（21:9, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, 1:1）
- **`quality`**: 
  - `&quot;hd&quot;` → 4K 分辨率（高质量）
  - `&quot;medium&quot;` → 2K 分辨率（中等质量）
  - `&quot;standard&quot;` → 默认分辨率（标准质量）
- **`n`**: 生成图片数量（1-10）
- **`response_format`**: `&quot;b64_json&quot;` 或 `&quot;url&quot;`（Data URI）

#### 方式二：Chat API + 参数设置 (✨ 新增)

**所有协议**（OpenAI、Claude）的 Chat API 现在都支持直接传递 `size` 和 `quality` 参数：

```python
# OpenAI Chat API
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    size=&quot;1920x1080&quot;,      # ✅ 支持任意 WIDTHxHEIGHT 格式
    quality=&quot;hd&quot;,          # ✅ &quot;standard&quot; | &quot;hd&quot; | &quot;medium&quot;
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

```bash
# Claude Messages API
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1/messages \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;x-api-key: sk-antigravity&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;: &quot;1280x720&quot;,
    &quot;quality&quot;: &quot;hd&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一只可爱的猫咪&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

```

**参数优先级**: `imageSize` 参数 &gt; `quality` 参数 &gt; 模型后缀

**✨ 新增 `imageSize` 参数支持**:

除了 `quality` 参数外,现在还支持直接使用 Gemini 原生的 `imageSize` 参数:

```python
# 使用 imageSize 参数(最高优先级)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    size=&quot;16:9&quot;,           # 宽高比
    imageSize=&quot;4K&quot;,        # ✨ 直接指定分辨率: &quot;1K&quot; | &quot;2K&quot; | &quot;4K&quot;
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

```bash
# Claude Messages API 也支持 imageSize
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1/messages \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;x-api-key: sk-antigravity&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;: &quot;1280x720&quot;,
    &quot;imageSize&quot;: &quot;4K&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一只可爱的猫咪&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

**参数说明**:
- **`imageSize`**: 直接指定分辨率 (`&quot;1K&quot;` / `&quot;2K&quot;` / `&quot;4K&quot;`)
- **`quality`**: 通过质量等级推断分辨率 (`&quot;standard&quot;` → 1K, `&quot;medium&quot;` → 2K, `&quot;hd&quot;` → 4K)
- **优先级**: 如果同时指定 `imageSize` 和 `quality`,系统会优先使用 `imageSize`


#### 方式三：Chat 接口 + 模型后缀
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image-16-9-4k&quot;,  # 格式：gemini-3-pro-image-[比例]-[质量]
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

**模型后缀说明**：
- **宽高比**: `-16-9`, `-9-16`, `-4-3`, `-3-4`, `-21-9`, `-1-1`
- **质量**: `-4k` (4K), `-2k` (2K), 不加后缀（标准）
- **示例**: `gemini-3-pro-image-16-9-4k` → 16:9 比例 + 4K 分辨率

#### 方式四：Cherry Studio 等客户端设置
在支持 OpenAI 协议的客户端（如 Cherry Studio）中，可以通过**模型设置**页面配置图片生成参数：

1. **进入模型设置**：选择 `gemini-3-pro-image` 模型
2. **配置参数**：
   - **Size (尺寸)**: 输入任意 `WIDTHxHEIGHT` 格式（如 `1920x1080`, `1024x1024`）
   - **Quality (质量)**: 选择 `standard` / `hd` / `medium`
   - **Number (数量)**: 设置生成图片数量（1-10）
3. **发送请求**：直接在对话框中输入图片描述即可

**参数映射规则**：
- `size: &quot;1920x1080&quot;` → 自动计算为 `16:9` 宽高比
- `quality: &quot;hd&quot;` → 映射为 `4K` 分辨率
- `quality: &quot;medium&quot;` → 映射为 `2K` 分辨率


## 📝 开发者与社区

*   **版本演进 (Changelog)**:
    *   **v4.1.23 (2026-02-25)**:
        -   **[安全增强] 优化与原生对齐应用层与底层特征指纹，提升请求稳定性与防拦截能力。**
        -   **[核心修复] 将 v1beta thinkingLevel 转换为 v1internal thinkingBudget (PR #2095)**:
            -   **问题根源**: OpenClaw、Cline 等客户端发送 v1beta 格式的 `thinkingLevel` 字符串（`&quot;NONE&quot;` / `&quot;LOW&quot;` / `&quot;MEDIUM&quot;` / `&quot;HIGH&quot;`）到 `generationConfig.thinkingConfig`。当 AGM 通过 Google v1internal API 代理请求时，Google 会因为 v1internal 仅接受数字型 `thinkingBudget` 而拒绝请求，返回 `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`。
            -   **修复方案**: 在 `wrap_request()` 的现有 budget 处理逻辑之前，新增一个早期转换步骤：检测 `thinkingLevel` 字符串，将其映射为对应的数字 `thinkingBudget`（`NONE`→0, `LOW`→4096, `MEDIUM`→8192, `HIGH`→24576），然后删除 `thinkingLevel` 字段并写入 `thinkingBudget`，确保下游所有 budget 处理逻辑（预算封顶、`maxOutputTokens` 调整、自适应检测）都能看到正确的数值预算。
            -   **测试**: 已验证 OpenClaw 发送 `thinkingLevel: &quot;LOW&quot;` 到 `gemini-3.1-pro-high`（Gemini 原生协议），请求现返回 `200 OK`，不再报 400 错误。
        -   **[核心修复] 账号数据损坏与后台任务无限循环修复 (PR #2094)**:
            -   **问题根源**: 当用户在设置中输入过大的刷新间隔值（如 999999999）时，`interval * 60 * 1000` 超过 JS 引擎 32 位有符号整数上限 `2,147,483,647ms`，浏览器会将 `setInterval` 延迟静默截断为 1ms，导致前端每秒触发数千次 `refreshAllQuotas`/`syncAccountFromDb` 请求，进而引发多线程并发写同一 `[uuid].json` 文件，造成字节流交错、JSON 尾部残留，账号数据永久损坏。
            -   **原子文件写入 (`account.rs`)**: `save_account` 改为先写入 UUID 后缀的临时文件，再通过 `fs::rename`（POSIX）/ `MoveFileExW`（Windows）原子替换目标文件，与已有的 `save_account_index` 保持一致，从根本上消除并发写导致的 JSON 损坏。
            -   **setInterval 溢出保护 (`BackgroundTaskRunner.tsx`)**: 对 `refresh_interval` 和 `sync_interval` 两个定时器的延迟参数加上 `Math.min(..., 2147483647)` 上界限制，防止超过 INT32_MAX 后被浏览器截断为 1ms 无限循环。
            -   **输入验证 (`Settings.tsx`)**: 将 `refresh_interval` 和 `sync_interval` 输入框的 `max` 属性从 `60` 更新为 `35791`（35791 min × 60000 &lt; INT32_MAX），并在 `onChange` 中添加 `NaN` fallback（默认为 1）及范围夹紧 `[1, 35791]`，从源头阻断非法值输入。
        -   **[核心优化] OAuth 换票专属：剔除 JA3 指纹与动态 User-Agent 伪装**:
            -   **纯净请求**: 仅针对 `exchange_code`（首次授权）和 `refresh_access_token`（静默续期）的换票请求，移除了底层网络库的 Chrome JA3 指纹伪装，恢复标准纯净的 TLS特征。
            -   **动态 UA**: 换票时自动提取编译时版本号 (`CURRENT_VERSION`) 构建专属的 `User-Agent`（如 `vscode/1.X.X (Antigravity/4.1.23)`），以匹配纯净 TLS 链路。
        -   **[功能增强] API 反代页面与设置页模型列表全面接入动态模型数据**:
            -   **问题根源**: &quot;API 反代 → 支持模型与集成&quot;列表与&quot;模型路由中心&quot;的目标模型选择下拉框，以及&quot;设置 → 固定配额模型&quot;列表，此前均仅从静态 `MODEL_CONFIG` 读取硬编码模型信息，导致账号实际下发的动态新模型（如 `GPT-OSS 120B`、`Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)` 等）无法出现在这些列表中。
            -   **修复方案**:
                -   重构 `useProxyModels` Hook：以账号 `quota.models` 动态数据为第一优先数据源，聚合所有账号里所有模型的 `display_name`（为主展示名称）和 `name`（为模型 ID）；`MODEL_CONFIG` 仅作为图标/分组的样式补充，以及无账号数据时的静态兜底。
                -   新增自动懒加载逻辑：`ApiProxy` 页面本身不调用 `fetchAccounts`，现在 Hook 内部检测到 store 为空时自动触发，保证动态模型在任意导航路径下均可正常展示。
                -   重构 `PinnedQuotaModels` 组件：采用同等策略，从 `useAccountStore` 拉取全账号动态模型，并修复了已固定的 &quot;thinking&quot; 类型模型显示&quot;未知&quot;的问题，改为优先展示其真实 `display_name`。
            -   **去重优化**: 所有列表均基于模型原始 `name`（小写）去重，并额外过滤掉 `-thinking` 后缀的 MODEL_CONFIG 静态别名条目（这类变体已由账号数据中的 `supports_thinking` 标记覆盖）。
    *   **v4.1.22 (2026-02-21)**:
        -   **[重要提醒] 2api 风控风险提示**:
            -   由于近期的谷歌风控原因，使用 2api 功能会导致账号被风控的概率显著增加。
            -   **强烈建议**: 为了确保您的账号安全与调用稳定性，建议减少或停止使用 2api 功能。目前更原生、更稳定的 **gRPC (`application/grpc`)** 或 **gRPC-Web (`application/grpc-web`)** 协议代理支持仍在积极测试中，如果您有相关的测试经验或想法，非常欢迎联系讨论，也欢迎您建立新分支一起探索！

        -   **[核心优化] Claude Sonnet 4.5 迁移至 4.6 (PR #2014)**:
            -   **模型升级**: 引入 `claude-sonnet-4-6` 及 `claude-sonnet-4-6-thinking` 作为主推模型。
            -   **平滑过渡**: 自动将 legacy 模型 `claude-sonnet-4-5` 重定向至 `4.6`。
            -   **全局适配**: 更新了全部 12 种语言的本地化文件、UI 标签（Sonnet 4.6, Sonnet 4.6 TK, Opus 4.6 TK）以及预设路由。
        -   **[核心优化] Gemini Pro 模型名称迁移 (PR #2063)**: 将 `gemini-pro-high/low` 迁移至 `gemini-3.1-pro`，确保与 Google 最新 API 命名对齐。
        -   **[重大架构] 国际化 (i18n) 与结构化模型配置集成 (PR #2040)**:
            -   **架构重构**: 引入了全新的 i18n 翻译框架，将硬编码的模型展示逻辑解耦至结构化 `MODEL_CONFIG`。
            -   **逻辑适配**: 在账号表格、详情弹窗和设置页面中集成了基于 i18n 标签的动态去重机制，修复了 Gemini 3.1 Pro 额度重复显示的 UI 问题。
            -   **多语言提升**: 优化并修正了所有 12 种语言的版本描述，将 `Claude 4.5` 描述全面升级为正式版 `4.6`，并将 `G3` 描述统一为 `G3.1`。
            -   **[核心修复] Claude Opus 4.6 思考模式 400 报错 (Claude 协议)**:
            -   **参数专项对齐**: 修复了 `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` 在 Claude 协议下返回 `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` 的问题。通过强制对齐 `thinkingBudget` (24576) 与 `maxOutputTokens` (57344)，并剔除在该模式下不兼容的 `stopSequences`，确保其请求参数与 100% 成功的 OpenAI 协议完全一致，提升了对 Claude 原生协议客户端的兼容性。
    *   **v4.1.21 (2026-02-17)**:
        -   **[核心修复] Cherry Studio / Claude 协议兼容性 (Fix Issue #2007)**:
            -   **maxOutputTokens 限制**: 修复了 Cherry Studio 等客户端发送超大 `maxOutputTokens` (128k) 导致 Google API 返回 `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` 的问题。现在自动将 Claude 协议的输出上限限制为 **65536**，确保请求始终在 Gemini 允许的范围内。
            -   **Adaptive 思考模式对齐**: 针对 Gemini 模型优化了 Claude 协议的 `thinking: { type: &quot;adaptive&quot; }` 行为。现在自动映射为 **24576** 的固定思考预算 (与 OpenAI 协议一致)，解决了 Gemini Vertex AI 对 `thinkingBudget: -1` 的不兼容问题，显著提升了 Cherry Studio 的思考模式稳定性。
        -   **[核心修复] 生产环境自定义协议支持 (PR #2005)**:
            -   **协议修复**: 默认启用 `custom-protocol` 特性，修复了生产环境下自定义协议 (如 `tauri://`) 加载失败的问题，确保本地资源和特殊协议请求的稳定性。
        -   **[核心优化] 托盘图标与窗口生命周期管理**:
            -   **智能托盘**: 引入 `AppRuntimeFlags` 状态管理，实现了窗口关闭行为与托盘状态的联动。
            -   **行为优化**: 当托盘启用时，关闭窗口将自动隐藏而非退出应

## ⚓ Oxc

_/oʊ ɛks siː/_

The Oxidation Compiler is a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript written in Rust.

Oxc is part of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/)&#039;s vision for a unified, high-performance toolchain for JavaScript. It powers [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) ([Vite]&#039;s future bundler) and enables the next generation of ultra-fast development tools that work seamlessly together.

For more information, check out our website at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs).

&lt;sub&gt;\* Oxidation is the chemical process that creates rust&lt;/sub&gt;

## 🏗️ Design Principles

- **Performance**: Through rigorous performance engineering.
- **Correctness**: Through conformance testing to standards and similar projects.
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and sensible configuration.
- **Modular composability**: Use individual components independently or compose them into complete toolchains.

## ⚡️ Quick Start

### Linter

The production-ready linter catches mistakes for you with sensible defaults and optional configuration:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds:

&lt;p float=&quot;left&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

→ [oxlint documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/cli.html)

### Formatter

Fast, opinionated code formatter compatible with [Prettier]:

```bash
npx oxfmt@latest
```

→ [Formatter documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter)

### Parser (Node.js)

The fastest JavaScript/TypeScript parser written in Rust:

```bash
npm install oxc-parser
```

```js
import { parseSync } from &quot;oxc-parser&quot;;
const result = parseSync(&quot;const x = 1;&quot;);
```

→ [Parser documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/parser)

### Transformer (Node.js)

TypeScript, React, and modern JavaScript transformation:

```bash
npm install oxc-transform
```

```js
import { transform } from &quot;oxc-transform&quot;;
const result = transform(&quot;source.tsx&quot;, code, { typescript: true });
```

→ [Transformer documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/transformer)

### Minifier (Node.js)

High-performance JavaScript minifier:

```bash
npm install oxc-minify
```

```js
import { minify } from &quot;oxc-minify&quot;;
const result = minify(code, { mangle: true });
```

→ [Minifier documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/minifier)

### Rust

Individual crates are published for building your own JavaScript tools:

```toml
[dependencies]
oxc = &quot;0.x&quot;
```

&lt;br/&gt;

GitButler is a powerful new Git-based version control system, designed from scratch to be simple, powerful and flexible. It is designed for ease of use and modern agentic workflows.

It features stacked branches, parallel branches, unlimited undo, easy commit mutations, forge integrations and more.

Works instantly in any existing Git repo as a friendlier and more powerful drop-in Git user interface replacement - for you and your agents.

## Main Features

Why use GitButler instead of vanilla Git? What a great question.

- **Stacked Branches** ([gui](https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/branch-management/stacked-branches), [cli](https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/branching-and-commiting#stacked-branches))
  - Effortlessly create branches stacked on other branches. Amend or edit any commit easily with automatic restacking.
- **Parallel Branches** ([gui](https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/branch-management/virtual-branches), [cli](https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/branching-and-commiting#parallel-branches))
  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches.
- **Easy Commit Management** ([gui](https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/branch-management/commits), [cli](https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/rubbing))
  - Uncommit, reword, amend, move, split and squash commits by dragging and dropping or simple CLI commands. Forget about `rebase -i`, you don&#039;t need it anymore.
- **Undo Timeline** ([gui](https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/timeline), [cli](https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/operations-log))
  - Logs all operations and changes and allows you to easily undo or revert any operation.
- **First Class Conflicts** ([gui](https://docs.gitbutler.com/overview#conflicting-branches), [cli](https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/conflict-resolution))
  - Rebases always succeed. Commits can be marked as conflicted and resolved at any time, in any order.
- **Forge Integration** ([gui](https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/forge-integration/github-integration), [cli](https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/forges))
  - Authenticate to GitHub or GitLab to easily open and update Pull Requests, list branches, get CI statuses and more. No other tools required.
- **AI Tooling** ([gui](https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/ai-integration/ai-overview), [cli](https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/ai-stuff))
  - Use built-in AI handlers to help create commit messages, branch names, PR descriptions and more.
  - Easily install hooks or skills for all modern agent systems to level up their Git management.

## Tech

The GitButler desktop app is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The `but` CLI is the same Rust backend engine with a Rust command line UI.

or [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D).

## License

The TLDR is that GitButler is under a [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) software license, meaning that you can use it, view the source, contribute, etc. You just can&#039;t build a competitor with it. It also becomes MIT after 2 years. So, MIT with an expiring non-compete clause.

## Contributing

So you want to help out? Please check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
document.

If you want to skip right to getting the code to actually compile, take a look
at the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;

CocoIndex makes it effortless to transform data with AI, and keep source data and target in sync. Whether you’re building a vector index, creating knowledge graphs for context engineering or performing any custom data transformations — goes beyond SQL.

&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot; src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/venn2.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;

## Exceptional velocity

Just declare transformation in dataflow with ~100 lines of python

```python
# import
data[&#039;content&#039;] = flow_builder.add_source(...)

# transform
data[&#039;out&#039;] = data[&#039;content&#039;]
    .transform(...)
    .transform(...)

# collect data
collector.collect(...)

# export to db, vector db, graph db ...
collector.export(...)
```

CocoIndex follows the idea of [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) programming model. Each transformation creates a new field solely based on input fields, without hidden states and value mutation. All data before/after each transformation is observable, with lineage out of the box.

**Particularly**, developers don&#039;t explicitly mutate data by creating, updating and deleting. They just need to define transformation/formula for a set of source data.

## Plug-and-Play Building Blocks

Native builtins for different source, targets and transformations. Standardize interface, make it 1-line code switch between different components - as easy as assembling building blocks.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/components.svg&quot; alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Data Freshness

CocoIndex keep source data and target in sync effortlessly.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4eb29b3-84ee-4fa0-a1e2-80eedeeabde6&quot; alt=&quot;Incremental Processing&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It has out-of-box support for incremental indexing:

- minimal recomputation on source or logic change.
- (re-)processing necessary portions; reuse cache when possible

## Quick Start

If you&#039;re new to CocoIndex, we recommend checking out

- 📖 [Documentation](https://cocoindex.io/docs)
- ⚡  [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart)
- 🎬 [Quick Start Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gv5R8nOXsWU?si=9ioeKYkMEnYevTXT)

### Setup

1. Install CocoIndex Python library

```sh
pip install -U cocoindex
```

2. [Install Postgres](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/installation#-install-postgres) if you don&#039;t have one. CocoIndex uses it for incremental processing.

3. (Optional) Install Claude Code skill for enhanced development experience. Run these commands in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code):

```
/plugin marketplace add cocoindex-io/cocoindex-claude
/plugin install cocoindex-skills@cocoindex
```

## Define data flow

Follow [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart) to define your first indexing flow. An example flow looks like:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name=&quot;TextEmbedding&quot;)
def text_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    # Add a data source to read files from a directory
    data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;] = flow_builder.add_source(cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path=&quot;markdown_files&quot;))

    # Add a collector for data to be exported to the vector index
    doc_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()

    # Transform data of each document
    with data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;].row() as doc:
        # Split the document into chunks, put into `chunks` field
        doc[&quot;chunks&quot;] = doc[&quot;content&quot;].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language=&quot;markdown&quot;, chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=500)

        # Transform data of each chunk
        with doc[&quot;chunks&quot;].row() as chunk:
            # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
            chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;] = chunk[&quot;text&quot;].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
                    model=&quot;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&quot;))

            # Collect the chunk into the collector.
            doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc[&quot;filename&quot;], location=chunk[&quot;location&quot;],
                                   text=chunk[&quot;text&quot;], embedding=chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;])

    # Export collected data to a vector index.
    doc_embeddings.export(
        &quot;doc_embeddings&quot;,
        cocoindex.targets.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=[&quot;filename&quot;, &quot;location&quot;],
        vector_indexes=[
            cocoindex.VectorIndexDef(
                field_name=&quot;embedding&quot;,
                metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

It defines an index flow like this:

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; The web-vault requires the use a secure context for the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API).
&gt; That means it will only work via `http://localhost:8000` (using the port from the example below) or if you [enable HTTPS](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS).

The recommended way to install and use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).
See [which container image to use](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Which-container-image-to-use) for an explanation of the provided tags.

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

Alternatively, you can also [build Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Building-binary) yourself.

While Vaultwarden is based upon the [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs) which has built-in support for TLS our recommendation would be that you setup a reverse proxy (see [proxy examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:8000:80
```

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

Vector is maintained by Datadog&#039;s [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.

Open-source, cross-platform, and feature rich iOS sideloading application. Supporting macOS, Linux[^1], and Windows[^2].

[^1]: On Linux, usbmuxd must be installed on your system. Don&#039;t worry though, it comes with most popular distributions by default already! However, due to some distributions [udev](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udev.7.html) rules `usbmuxd` may stop running after no devices are connected causing Impactor to not detect the device after plugging it in. You can mitigate this by plugging your phone first then restarting the app. \
\
Auto-refresh will not work the same as it would on other platforms like macOS/Windows, due to `usbmuxd` lacking WiFi connectivity so it will attempt to do it automatically only when a device is plugged in, we are looking for a proper solution though.\
\
Some distributions (like Bazzite) may need you to run `sudo update-crypto-policies` so `usbmuxd` ends up detecting the device again.

[^2]: On Windows, [iTunes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106372) must be downloaded so Impactor is able to use the drivers for interacting with Apple devices.

## Download

Visit [releases](https://github.com/khcrysalis/PlumeImpactor/releases) and get the latest version for your computer.

###### *This is also available on flatpak &amp; homebrew.*

**Linux:**

&lt;a href=&quot;https://flathub.org/en/apps/dev.khcrysalis.PlumeImpactor&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

**macOS:**

```sh
brew install --cask impactor
```

## How it works

How it works is that we try to replicate what [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) would do but in our own application, by using your Apple Account (which serves the purpose of being a &quot;Developer&quot;) so we can request certificates, provisioning profiles, and register your device from Apple themselves. 

Apple here is the provider of these and how we&#039;ll even be able to get apps on your phone. Unfortunately, without paying for their developer program you are limited to 7-days and a limited amount of apps/components you can register.

The very first thing we do when trying to sideload an app, is register your idevice to their servers, then try to create a certificate. These last 365 days, we also store the key locally so you would need to copy these keys over to other machines, if you don&#039;t, Impactor will try to make a new one.

After that, we try to register your app that you&#039;re trying to sideload, and try to provision it with proper entitlements gathered from the binary. Once we do, we have to download the neccessary files when signing, that being the certificate and provisioning profile that we just created.

Lastly, we do all of the necessary modifications we need to the app you&#039;re trying to sideload, can range between tweaks, name changing, etc. Though most importantly, we need to *sign* the app using [apple-codesign-rs](https://github.com/indygreg/apple-platform-rs) so we can **install it** with [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice)!

That&#039;s the entire gist of how this works! Of course its very short and brief, however feel free to look how it works since its open source :D

### Pairing File

Impactor also allows the user to generate a pairing file for applications to talk directly to the device remotely. This pairing file is device specific and will become invalid if you ever re-trust/update/reset.

Supported apps for pairing file:
- [`SideStore`](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore): Uses your Apple ID to install iOS apps.
- [`Feather`](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather): Uses raw certificates to install iOS apps.
- [`SparseBox`](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/SparseBox): Device customizer.
- [`LiveContainer + SideStore`](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer) Uses your Apple ID to install iOS apps.
- [`Antrag`](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag): List currently installed iOS apps.
- [`Protokolle`](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Protokolle): View logs from system processes.
- [`StikDebug`](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug): Enable JIT for iOS apps.
- [`EnsWilde`](https://github.com/YangJiiii/EnsWilde): Device customizer.
- [`ByeTunes`](https://github.com/EduAlexxis/ByeTunes): Import mp3 files to the Music App.

You can retrieve this file by either sideloading the supported app of your choice, or going to the `Utilities` page when a device is connected and press install for the supported app. Head over to the [downloads](https://github.com/khcrysalis/PlumeImpactor/releases).

## Overview

AI coding agents are increasingly writing the world&#039;s code and human engineers now spend the majority of their time planning, reviewing, and orchestrating tasks. Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:

- Easily switch between different coding agents
- Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence
- Quickly review work and start dev servers
- Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on
- Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs
- Open projects remotely via SSH when running Vibe Kanban on a remote server

You can watch a video overview [here](https://youtu.be/TFT3KnZOOAk).

## Installation

Make sure you have authenticated with your favourite coding agent. A full list of supported coding agents can be found in the [docs](https://vibekanban.com/docs). Then in your terminal run:

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

## Support

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) for feature requests. Please open a discussion to create a feature request. For bugs please open an issue on this repo.

## Contributing

We would prefer that ideas and changes are first raised with the core team via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/AC4nwVtJM3), where we can discuss implementation details and alignment with the existing roadmap. Please do not open PRs without first discussing your proposal with the team.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (&gt;=20)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (&gt;=8)

Additional development tools:
```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Running the dev server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the backend and web app. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.

### Building the web app

To build just the web app:

```bash
cd packages/local-web
pnpm run build
```

### Build from source (macOS)

1. Run `./local-build.sh`
2. Test with `cd npx-cli &amp;&amp; node bin/cli.js`

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |
| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |
| `PORT` | Runtime | Auto-assign | **Production**: Server port. **Dev**: Frontend port (backend uses PORT+1) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT+1) |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend dev server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT) |
| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |
| `MCP_HOST` | Runtime | Value of `HOST` | MCP server connection host (use `127.0.0.1` when `HOST=0.0.0.0` on Windows) |
| `MCP_PORT` | Runtime | Value of `BACKEND_PORT` | MCP server connection port |
| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable all git worktree cleanup including orphan and expired workspace cleanup (for debugging) |
| `VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Runtime | Not set | Comma-separated list of origins that are allowed to make backend API requests (e.g., `https://my-vibekanban-frontend.com`) |

**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.

#### Self-Hosting with a Reverse Proxy or Custom Domain

When running Vibe Kanban behind a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, Caddy, Traefik) or on a custom domain, you must set the `VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. Without this, the browser&#039;s Origin header won&#039;t match the backend&#039;s expected host, and API requests will be rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.

Set it to the full origin URL(s) where your frontend is accessible:

```bash
# Single origin
VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://vk.example.com

# Multiple origins (comma-separated)
VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://vk.example.com,https://vk-staging.example.com
```

### Remote Deployment

When running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (e.g., via systemctl, Docker, or cloud hosting), you can configure your editor to open projects via SSH:

1. **Access via tunnel**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or similar to expose the web UI
2. **Configure remote SSH** in Settings → Editor Integration:
   - Set **Remote SSH Host** to your server hostname or IP
   - Set **Remote SSH User** to your SSH username (optional)
3. **Prerequisites**:
   - SSH access from your local machine to the remote server
   - SSH keys configured (passwordless authentication)
   - VSCode Remote-SSH extension

When configured, the &quot;Open in VSCode&quot; buttons will generate URLs like `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path` that open your local editor and connect to the remote server.

See the [documentation](https://vibekanban.com/docs/configuration-customisation/global-settings#remote-ssh-configuration) for detailed setup instructions.

# Tempo

The blockchain for payments at scale.

[Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/) is a blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments. Its architecture focuses on high throughput, low cost, and features that financial institutions, payment service providers, and fintech platforms expect from modern payment infrastructure.

You can get started today by integrating with the [Tempo testnet](https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/integrate-tempo), [building on Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/guide/use-accounts), [running a Tempo node](https://docs.tempo.xyz/guide/node), reading the [Tempo protocol specs](https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol) or by [building with Tempo SDKs](https://docs.tempo.xyz/sdk).

## What makes Tempo different

- [TIP‑20 token standard](https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol/tip20/overview) (enshrined ERC‑20 extensions)

  - Predictable payment throughput via dedicated payment lanes reserved for TIP‑20 transfers (eliminates noisy‑neighbor contention).
  - Native reconciliation with on‑transfer memos and commitment patterns (hash/locator) for off‑chain PII and large data.
  - Built‑in compliance through [TIP‑403 Policy Registry](https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol/tip403/overview): single policy shared across multiple tokens, updated once and enforced everywhere.

- Low, predictable fees in [stablecoins](https://docs.tempo.xyz/learn/stablecoins)

  - Users pay gas directly in USD-stablecoins at launch; the [Fee AMM](https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol/fees/fee-amm#fee-amm-overview) automatically converts to the validator’s preferred stablecoin.
  - TIP‑20 transfers target sub‑millidollar costs (&lt;$0.001).

- [Tempo Transactions](https://docs.tempo.xyz/guide/tempo-transaction) (native “smart accounts”)

  - Batched payments: atomic multi‑operation payouts (payroll, settlements, refunds).
  - Fee sponsorship: apps can pay users&#039; gas to streamline onboarding and flows.
  - Scheduled payments: protocol‑level time windows for recurring and timed disbursements.
  - Modern authentication: passkeys via WebAuthn/P256 (biometric sign‑in, secure enclave, cross‑device sync).

- Performance and finality

  - Built on the [Reth SDK](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), the most performant and flexible EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) execution client.
  - Simplex Consensus (via [Commonware](https://commonware.xyz/)): fast, sub‑second finality in normal conditions; graceful degradation under adverse networks.

- Coming soon

  - On‑chain FX and non‑USD stablecoin support for direct on‑chain liquidity; pay fees in more currencies.
  - Native private token standard: opt‑in privacy for balances/transfers coexisting with issuer compliance and auditability.

## What makes Tempo familiar

- Fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), targeting the Osaka hardfork.
- Deploy and interact with smart contracts using the same tools, languages, and frameworks used on Ethereum, such as Solidity, Foundry, and Hardhat.
- All Ethereum JSON-RPC methods work out of the box.

While the execution environment mirrors Ethereum&#039;s, Tempo introduces some differences optimized for payments, described [here](https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/evm-compatibility).

## Getting Started

### As a user

You can connect to Tempo&#039;s public testnet using the following details:

| Property           | Value                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Network Name**   | Tempo Testnet (Moderato)           |
| **Currency**       | `USD`                              |
| **Chain ID**       | `42431`                            |
| **HTTP URL**       | `https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz`   |
| **WebSocket URL**  | `wss://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz`     |
| **Block Explorer** | `https://explore.tempo.xyz`        |

Next, grab some stablecoins to test with from Tempo&#039;s [Faucet](https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/faucet#faucet).

Alternatively, use [`cast`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-foundry):

```bash
cast rpc tempo_fundAddress &lt;ADDRESS&gt; --rpc-url https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz
```

### As an operator
