            <h2>README</h2><pre># Overview

libsignal contains platform-agnostic APIs used by the official Signal clients and servers, exposed
as a Java, Swift, or TypeScript library. The underlying implementations are written in Rust:

- libsignal-protocol: Implements the Signal protocol, including the [Double Ratchet algorithm][]. A
  replacement for [libsignal-protocol-java][] and [libsignal-metadata-java][].
- signal-crypto: Cryptographic primitives such as AES-GCM. We use [RustCrypto][]&#039;s where we can
  but sometimes have differing needs.
- device-transfer: Support logic for Signal&#039;s device-to-device transfer feature.
- attest: Functionality for remote attestation of [SGX enclaves][] and server-side [HSMs][].
- zkgroup: Functionality for [zero-knowledge groups][] and related features available in Signal.
- zkcredential: An abstraction for the sort of zero-knowledge credentials used by zkgroup, based on the paper &quot;[The Signal Private Group System][]&quot; by Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha.
- poksho: Utilities for implementing zero-knowledge proofs (such as those used by zkgroup); stands for &quot;proof-of-knowledge, stateful-hash-object&quot;.
- account-keys: Functionality for consistently using [PINs][] as passwords in Signal&#039;s Secure Value Recovery system, as well as other account-wide key operations.
- usernames: Functionality for username generation, hashing, and proofs.
- media: Utilities for manipulating media.

This repository is used by the Signal client apps ([Android][], [iOS][], and [Desktop][]) as well as
server-side. Use outside of Signal is unsupported. In particular, the products of this repository
are the Java, Swift, and TypeScript libraries that wrap the underlying Rust implementations. All
APIs and implementations are subject to change without notice, as are the JNI, C, and Node add-on
&quot;bridge&quot; layers. However, backwards-incompatible changes to the Java, Swift, TypeScript, and
non-bridge Rust APIs will be reflected in the version number on a best-effort basis, including
increases to the minimum supported tools versions.

# Building

### Toolchain Installation

To build anything in this repository you must have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed,
as well as Clang, libclang, [CMake](https://cmake.org), Make, protoc, and git.

#### Linux/Debian

On a Debian-like system, you can get these extra dependencies through `apt`:

```shell
$ apt-get install clang libclang-dev cmake make protobuf-compiler git
```

#### macOS

On macOS, we have a best-effort maintained script to set up the Rust toolchain you can run by:

```shell
$ bin/mac_setup.sh
```

## Rust

### First Build and Test

The build currently uses a specific version of the Rust nightly compiler, which
will be downloaded automatically by cargo. To build and test the basic protocol
libraries:

```shell
$ cargo build
...
$ cargo test
...
```

### Additional Rust Tools

The basic tools above should get you set up for most libsignal Rust development. 

Eventually, you may find that you need some additional Rust tools like `cbindgen` to modify the bridges to the 
client libraries or `taplo` for code formatting. 

You should always install any Rust tools you need that may affect the build from cargo rather than from your system
package manager (e.g. `apt` or `brew`). Package managers sometimes contain outdated versions of these tools that can break
the build with incompatibility issues (especially cbindgen).

To install the main Rust extra dependencies matching the versions we use, you can run the following commands: 

```shell
$ cargo +stable install cbindgen cargo-fuzz
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat ../acknowledgments/cargo-about-version)&quot; --locked cargo-about
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat ../.taplo-cli-version)&quot; --locked taplo-cli
```

## Java/Android

To build for Android you must install several additional packages including a JDK,
the Android NDK/SDK, and add the Android targets to the Rust compiler, using

```rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android```

To build the Java/Android ``jar`` and ``aar``, and run the tests:

```shell
$ cd java
$ ./gradlew test
$ ./gradlew build # if you need AAR outputs
```

You can pass `-P debugLevelLogs` to Gradle to build without filtering out debug- and verbose-level
logs from Rust.

Alternately, a build system using Docker is available:

```shell
$ cd java
$ make
```

When exposing new APIs to Java, you will need to run `rust/bridge/jni/bin/gen_java_decl.py` in
addition to rebuilding. This requires installing the `cbindgen` Rust tool, as detailed above. 

### Maven Central

Signal publishes Java packages on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org) for its own use,
under the names org.signal:libsignal-server, org.signal:libsignal-client, and
org.signal:libsignal-android. libsignal-client and libsignal-server contain native libraries for
Debian-flavored x86_64 Linux as well as Windows (x86_64) and macOS (x86_64 and arm64).
libsignal-android contains native libraries for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64 Android.

When building for Android you need *both* libsignal-android and libsignal-client, but the Windows
and macOS libraries in libsignal-client won&#039;t automatically be excluded from your final app. You can
explicitly exclude them using `packagingOptions`:

```
android {
  // ...
  packagingOptions {
    resources {
      excludes += setOf(&quot;libsignal_jni*.dylib&quot;, &quot;signal_jni*.dll&quot;)
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

You can additionally exclude `libsignal_jni_testing.so` if you do not plan to use any of the APIs
intended for client testing.


## Swift

To learn about the Swift build process see [``swift/README.md``](swift/)


## Node

You&#039;ll need Node installed to build. If you have [nvm][], you can run `nvm use` to select an
appropriate version automatically.

We use `npm` as our package manager, and `node-gyp` to control building the Rust library.

```shell
$ cd node
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ npx node-gyp rebuild  # clean-&gt;configure-&gt;build
$ npm run tsc
$ npm run test
```

When testing changes locally, you can use `npm run build` to do an incremental rebuild of the Rust library. Alternately, `npm run build-with-debug-level-logs` will rebuild without filtering out debug- and verbose-level logs.

When exposing new APIs to Node, you will need to run `rust/bridge/node/bin/gen_ts_decl.py` in
addition to rebuilding.

[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

### NPM

Signal publishes the NPM package `@signalapp/libsignal-client` for its own use, including native
libraries for Windows, macOS, and Debian-flavored Linux. Both x64 and arm64 builds are included for
all three platforms, but the arm64 builds for Windows and Linux are considered experimental, since
there are no official builds of Signal for those architectures.


# Contributions

Signal does accept external contributions to this project. However unless the change is
simple and easily understood, for example fixing a bug or portability issue, adding a new
test, or improving performance, first open an issue to discuss your intended change as not
all changes can be accepted.

Contributions that will not be used directly by one of Signal&#039;s official client apps may still be
considered, but only if they do not pose an undue maintenance burden or conflict with the goals of
the project.

Signing a [CLA (Contributor License Agreement)](https://signal.org/cla/) is required for all contributions.

## Code Formatting and Acknowledgments

You can run the styler on the entire project by running:

```shell
just format-all
```

You can run more extensive tests as well as linters and clippy by running:

```shell
just check-pre-commit
```

When making a PR that adjusts dependencies, you&#039;ll need to regenerate our acknowledgments files. See [``acknowledgments/README.md``](acknowledgments/).

&lt;a href=&quot;#introduction&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Juspay, founded in 2012, is a global leader in payment orchestration and checkout solutions, trusted by 400+ leading enterprises and brands worldwide. Hyperswitch is Juspay&#039;s new generation of composable, commercial open-source payments platform for merchant and brands. It is an enterprise-grade, transparent and modular payments platform designed to provide digital businesses access to the best payments infrastructure.

Here are the key components of Hyperswitch that deliver the whole solution:

* [Hyperswitch Backend](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch): Hyperswitch backend enables seamless payment processing with comprehensive support for various payment flows - authorization, authentication, void and capture workflows along with robust management of post-payment processes like refunds and chargeback handling. Additionally, Hyperswitch supports non-payment use cases by enabling connections with external FRM or authentication providers as part of the payment flow. The backend optimizes payment routing with customizable workflows, including success rate-based routing, rule-based routing, volume distribution, fallback handling, and intelligent retry mechanisms for failed payments based on specific error codes.

* [SDK (Frontend)](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web): The SDK, available for web, [Android, and iOS](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-client-core), unifies the payment experience across various methods such as cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers, and more, while supporting the diverse payment flows of underlying PSPs. When paired with the locker, it surfaces the user&#039;s saved payment methods.    

* [Control Center](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-control-center): The Control Center enables users to manage the entire payments stack without any coding. It allows the creation of workflows for routing, payment retries, and defining conditions to invoke 3DS, fraud risk management (FRM), and surcharge modules. The Control Center provides access to transaction, refund, and chargeback operations across all integrated PSPs, transaction-level logs for initial debugging, and detailed analytics and insights into payment performance.

# Rayhunter

![Tests](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/actions/workflows/check-and-test.yml/badge.svg)

Rayhunter is an IMSI Catcher Catcher for the Orbic mobile hotspot.

**THIS CODE IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON IN HIGH RISK SITUATIONS!**


## The Hardware

Rayhunter has been built and tested for the Orbic RC400L mobile hotspot. It may work on other orbics and other
linux/qualcom devices, but this is the only one we have tested on.
Buy the orbic [using bezos bucks](https://www.amazon.com/Orbic-Verizon-Hotspot-Connect-Enabled/dp/B08N3CHC4Y),
or on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=orbic+rc400l).

## Setup


1. Download the latest [Rayhunter release bundle](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/releases) and extract it.
**If you are installing from the cloned github repository please see the development instructions below, running `install.sh` from the git tree will not work.**
2. Turn on the Orbic device and plug it into your computer using a USB-C Cable.
3. On MacOS or Linux run the install script `install.sh`. 
4. Once finished, Rayhunter should be running! You can verify this by visiting the web UI as described below.

### Notes 
  * The install script has only been tested for Linux on the latest version of Ubuntu. If it fails you will need to follow the install steps outlined in **Development** below.
  * The install script also won&#039;t work on older macs with intel chips, for those macs you will need to follow the instructions at https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/wiki/Install-Rayhunter-on-Mac-Intel-devices
  * We don&#039;t currently support automated installs on windows, you will have to follow the manual install instructions below*

## Updating
Great news: if you&#039;ve successfully installed rayhunter, you already know how to update it! Our update process is identical to the setup process: simply download the latest release and follow the steps in the [setup section](#Setup).


## Usage

Once installed, Rayhunter will run automatically whenever your Orbic device is running. It serves a web UI that provides some basic controls, such as being able to start/stop recordings, download captures, and view heuristic analyses of captures. You can access this UI in one of two ways:

1. Over wifi: Connect your phone/laptop to the Orbic&#039;s wifi network and visit `http://192.168.1.1:8080` (click past your browser warning you about the connection not being secure, Rayhunter doesn&#039;t have HTTPS yet!).
    * Note that you&#039;ll need the Orbic&#039;s wifi password for this, which can be retrieved by pressing the &quot;MENU&quot; button on the device and opening the 2.4 GHz menu.
2. Over usb: Connect the Orbic device to your laptop via usb. Run `adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080`, then visit `http://localhost:8080`. For this you will need to install the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on your computer, you can copy the version that was downloaded inside the releases/platform-tools/` folder to somewhere else in your path or you can install it manually.  You can find instructions for doing so on your platform [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/#how-to-set-up-adb-on-your-computer), (don&#039;t worry about instructions for installing it on a phone/device yet).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need an active SIM card to use Rayhunter?
**It Depends**. Operation of Rayhunter does require the insertion of a SIM card into the device, but whether that SIM card has to be currently active for our tests to work is still under investigation. If you want to use the device as a hotspot in addition to a research device an active plan would of course be necessary, however we have not done enough testing yet to know whether an active subscription is required for detection. If you want to test the device with an inactive SIM card, we would certainly be interested in seeing any data you collect, and especially any runs that trigger an alert!
### Help, Rayhunter&#039;s line is red! What should I do?
Unfortunately, the circumstances that might lead to a positive CSS signal are quite varied, so we don&#039;t have a universal recommendation for how to deal with the a positive signal. Depending on your circumstances and threat model, you may want to turn off your phone until you are out of the area (or put it on airplane mode) and tell your friends to do the same!

If you&#039;ve received a Rayhunter warning and would like to help us with our research, please send your Rayhunter data captures (QMDL and PCAP logs) to us at our [Signal](https://signal.org/) username [**ElectronicFrontierFoundation.90**](https://signal.me/#eu/HZbPPED5LyMkbTxJsG2PtWc2TXxPUR1OxBMcJGLOPeeCDGPuaTpOi5cfGRY6RrGf) with the following information: capture date, capture location, device, device model, and Rayhunter version. If you&#039;re unfamiliar with Signal, feel free to check out our [Security Self Defense guide on it](https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-use-signal).
 
Please note that this file may contain sensitive information such as your IMSI and the unique IDs of cell towers you were near which could be used to ascertain your location at the time.

### Does Rayhunter work outside of the US?
**Probably**. Some Rayhunter users have reported successfully using it in other countries with unlocked devices and SIM cards from local telcos. We can&#039;t guarantee whether or not it will work for you though.
### Should I get a locked or unlocked orbic device? What is the difference?
If you want to use a non verizon SIM card you will probably need an unlocked device. But it&#039;s not clear how locked the locked devices are nor how to unlock them, we welcome any experimentation and information regarding the use of unlocked devices.
### Does Rayhunter work on any other devices besides the Orbic RC400L?
**Maybe**. We have not tested Rayhunter on any other hardware but we would love to expand the supported platforms. We will consider giving official support to any hardware platform that can be bought for around $20-30USD. The Rayhunter daemon should theoretically work on any linux/android device that has a qualcomm chip with a /dev/diag interface and root access, though our installer script has only been tested with an Orbic. If you get it working on another device, please let us know!
### How do I delete capture files from the Rayhunter device?
You can get a shell on the device by inputting `adb shell` to a terminal with the device connected, you can check if it is detected with `adb devices`.
The capture files are located at */data/rayhunter/qmdl* but you will need root access to modify or delete them. From the adb shell run `/bin/rootshell` and you can now use commands like &#039;rm&#039; as root to modify and delete entries in the */data/rayhunter/qmdl* directory. **Be careful not to delete important files in other directories as you may seriously damage the device**.

## Development
* Install ADB on your computer using the instructions above, and make sure it&#039;s in your terminal&#039;s PATH
  * You can verify if ADB is in your PATH by running `which adb` in a terminal. If it prints the filepath to where ADB is installed, you&#039;re set! Otherwise, try following one of these guides:
    * [linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/652936/adding-android-sdk-platform-tools-to-path-downloaded-from-umake)
    * [macOS](https://www.repeato.app/setting-up-adb-on-macos-a-step-by-step-guide/)
    * [Windows](https://medium.com/@yadav-ajay/a-step-by-step-guide-to-setting-up-adb-path-on-windows-0b833faebf18)

### If you&#039;re on x86 linux
Install rust the usual way and then install cross compiling dependences:
```
sudo apt install curl build-essential libc6-armhf-cross libc6-dev-armhf-cross gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

Now you can root your device and install Rayhunter by running `./tools/install-dev.sh`

### If you&#039;re on windows or can&#039;t run the install scripts
* Root your device on windows using the instructions here: https://xdaforums.com/t/resetting-verizon-orbic-speed-rc400l-firmware-flash-kajeet.4334899/#post-87855183

* Build for arm using `cargo build`

* Run tests using `cargo test_pc`

* Push the scripts in `scripts/` to `/etc/init.d` on device and make a directory called `/data/rayhunter` using `adb shell` (and sshell for your root shell if you followed the steps above)

* you also need to copy `config.toml.example` to `/data/rayhunter/config.toml`

* Then run `./make.sh` this will build the binary and push it over adb. Restart your device or run `/etc/init.d/rayhunter_daemon start` on the device and you are good to go.

* Write your code and write tests

* Build for arm using `cargo build`

* Run tests using `cargo test_pc`

* push to the device with `./make.sh`

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you are running these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, otherwise the application might not be able to find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

## Repository Structure

The main components of this repository are structured as follows:

  * `core/`: The implementation of `libp2p-core` with its `Transport` and
    `StreamMuxer` API on which almost all other crates depend.

  * `transports/`: Implementations of transport protocols (e.g. TCP) and protocol upgrades
    (e.g. for authenticated encryption, compression, ...) based on the `libp2p-core` `Transport`
    API.

  * `muxers/`: Implementations of the `StreamMuxer` interface of `libp2p-core`,
    e.g. (sub)stream multiplexing protocols on top of (typically TCP) connections.
    Multiplexing protocols are (mandatory) `Transport` upgrades.

  * `swarm/`: The implementation of `libp2p-swarm` building on `libp2p-core`
    with the central interfaces `NetworkBehaviour` and `ConnectionHandler` used
    to implement application protocols (see `protocols/`).

  * `protocols/`: Implementations of application protocols based on the
    `libp2p-swarm` APIs.

  * `misc/`: Utility libraries.

  * `libp2p/examples/`: Worked examples of built-in application protocols (see `protocols/`)
    with common `Transport` configurations.

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

See the [installation documentation](docs/install).

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

Tauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:

| Platform   | Versions                                                                                                        |

DataFusion is an extensible query engine written in [Rust] that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate provides libraries and binaries for developers building fast and
feature rich database and analytic systems, customized to particular workloads.
See [use cases] for examples. The following related subprojects target end users:

- [DataFusion Python](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/) offers a Python interface for SQL and DataFrame
  queries.
- [DataFusion Ray](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ray/) provides a distributed version of DataFusion that scales
  out on Ray clusters.
- [DataFusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/) is an accelerator for Apache Spark based on
  DataFusion.

&quot;Out of the box,&quot;
DataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs, excellent [performance],
built-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro, extensive customization, and
a great community.

DataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,
vectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can
customize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,
query languages, functions, custom operators and more.

## Crate features

This crate has several [features] which can be specified in your `Cargo.toml`.

[features]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html

Default features:

- `nested_expressions`: functions for working with nested type function such as `array_to_string`
- `compression`: reading files compressed with `xz2`, `bzip2`, `flate2`, and `zstd`
- `crypto_expressions`: cryptographic functions such as `md5` and `sha256`
- `datetime_expressions`: date and time functions such as `to_timestamp`

[apache avro]: https://avro.apache.org/
[apache parquet]: https://parquet.apache.org/

## Rust Version Compatibility Policy

The Rust toolchain releases are tracked at [Rust Versions](https://releases.rs) and follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A Rust toolchain release can be identified
by a version string like `1.80.0`, or more generally `major.minor.patch`.

DataFusion&#039;s supports the last 4 stable Rust minor versions released and any such versions released within the last 4 months.

For example, given the releases `1.78.0`, `1.79.0`, `1.80.0`, `1.80.1` and `1.81.0` DataFusion will support 1.78.0, which is 3 minor versions prior to the most minor recent `1.81`.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

DataFusion enforces MSRV policy using a [MSRV CI Check](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fdatafusion+rust-version+language%3ATOML+path%3A%2F%5ECargo.toml%2F&amp;type=code)

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html
[dependabot]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.

[![License: MIT OR Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/clippy.svg)](#license)

A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) code.

[There are over 750 lints included in this crate!](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html)

Lints are divided into categories, each with a default [lint level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html).
You can choose how much Clippy is supposed to ~~annoy~~ help you by changing the lint level by category.

| Category              | Description                                                                         | Default level |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `clippy::all`         | all lints that are on by default (correctness, suspicious, style, complexity, perf) | **warn/deny** |
| `clippy::correctness` | code that is outright wrong or useless                                              | **deny**      |
| `clippy::suspicious`  | code that is most likely wrong or useless                                           | **warn**      |
| `clippy::style`       | code that should be written in a more idiomatic way                                 | **warn**      |
| `clippy::complexity`  | code that does something simple but in a complex way                                | **warn**      |
| `clippy::perf`        | code that can be written to run faster                                              | **warn**      |
| `clippy::pedantic`    | lints which are rather strict or have occasional false positives                    | allow         |
| `clippy::restriction` | lints which prevent the use of language and library features[^restrict]             | allow         |
| `clippy::nursery`     | new lints that are still under development                                          | allow         |
| `clippy::cargo`       | lints for the cargo manifest                                                        | allow         |

More to come, please [file an issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues) if you have ideas!

The `restriction` category should, *emphatically*, not be enabled as a whole. The contained
lints may lint against perfectly reasonable code, may not have an alternative suggestion,
and may contradict any other lints (including other categories). Lints should be considered
on a case-by-case basis before enabling.

[^restrict]: Some use cases for `restriction` lints include:
    - Strict coding styles (e.g. [`clippy::else_if_without_else`]).
    - Additional restrictions on CI (e.g. [`clippy::todo`]).
    - Preventing panicking in certain functions (e.g. [`clippy::unwrap_used`]).
    - Running a lint only on a subset of code (e.g. `#[forbid(clippy::float_arithmetic)]` on a module).

[`clippy::else_if_without_else`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#else_if_without_else
[`clippy::todo`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#todo
[`clippy::unwrap_used`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#unwrap_used

## Usage

Below are instructions on how to use Clippy as a cargo subcommand,
in projects that do not use cargo, or in Travis CI.

### As a cargo subcommand (`cargo clippy`)

One way to use Clippy is by installing Clippy through rustup as a cargo
subcommand.

#### Step 1: Install Rustup

You can install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) on supported platforms. This will help
us install Clippy and its dependencies.

If you already have Rustup installed, update to ensure you have the latest
Rustup and compiler:

```terminal
rustup update
```

#### Step 2: Install Clippy

Once you have rustup and the latest stable release (at least Rust 1.29) installed, run the following command:

```terminal
rustup component add clippy
```

If it says that it can&#039;t find the `clippy` component, please run `rustup self update`.

#### Step 3: Run Clippy

Now you can run Clippy by invoking the following command:

```terminal
cargo clippy
```

#### Automatically applying Clippy suggestions

Clippy can automatically apply some lint suggestions, just like the compiler. Note that `--fix` implies
`--all-targets`, so it can fix as much code as it can.

```terminal
cargo clippy --fix
```

#### Workspaces

All the usual workspace options should work with Clippy. For example the following command
will run Clippy on the `example` crate:

```terminal
cargo clippy -p example
```

As with `cargo check`, this includes dependencies that are members of the workspace, like path dependencies.
If you want to run Clippy **only** on the given crate, use the `--no-deps` option like this:

```terminal
cargo clippy -p example -- --no-deps
```

### Using `clippy-driver`

Clippy can also be used in projects that do not use cargo. To do so, run `clippy-driver`
with the same arguments you use for `rustc`. For example:

```terminal
clippy-driver --edition 2018 -Cpanic=abort foo.rs
```

Note that `clippy-driver` is designed for running Clippy only and should not be used as a general
replacement for `rustc`. `clippy-driver` may produce artifacts that are not optimized as expected,
for example.

### Travis CI

You can add Clippy to Travis CI in the same way you use it locally:

```yaml
language: rust
rust:
  - stable
  - beta
before_script:
  - rustup component add clippy
script:
  - cargo clippy
  # if you want the build job to fail when encountering warnings, use
  - cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  # in order to also check tests and non-default crate features, use
  - cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  - cargo test
  # etc.
```

Note that adding `-D warnings` will cause your build to fail if **any** warnings are found in your code.
That includes warnings found by rustc (e.g. `dead_code`, etc.). If you want to avoid this and only cause
an error for Clippy warnings, use `#![deny(clippy::all)]` in your code or `-D clippy::all` on the command
line. (You can swap `clippy::all` with the specific lint category you are targeting.)

## Configuration

### Allowing/denying lints

You can add options to your code to `allow`/`warn`/`deny` Clippy lints:

* the whole set of `Warn` lints using the `clippy` lint group (`#![deny(clippy::all)]`).
  Note that `rustc` has additional [lint groups](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/groups.html).

* all lints using both the `clippy` and `clippy::pedantic` lint groups (`#![deny(clippy::all)]`,
  `#![deny(clippy::pedantic)]`). Note that `clippy::pedantic` contains some very aggressive
  lints prone to false positives.

* only some lints (`#![deny(clippy::single_match, clippy::box_vec)]`, etc.)

* `allow`/`warn`/`deny` can be limited to a single function or module using `#[allow(...)]`, etc.

Note: `allow` means to suppress the lint for your code. With `warn` the lint
will only emit a warning, while with `deny` the lint will emit an error, when
triggering for your code. An error causes Clippy to exit with an error code, so
is useful in scripts like CI/CD.

If you do not want to include your lint levels in your code, you can globally
enable/disable lints by passing extra flags to Clippy during the run:

To allow `lint_name`, run

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -A clippy::lint_name
```

And to warn on `lint_name`, run

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::lint_name
```

This also works with lint groups. For example, you
can run Clippy with warnings for all lints enabled:

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic
```

If you care only about a single lint, you can allow all others and then explicitly warn on
the lint(s) you are interested in:

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -A clippy::all -W clippy::useless_format -W clippy::...
```

### Configure the behavior of some lints

Some lints can be configured in a TOML file named `clippy.toml` or `.clippy.toml`. It contains a basic `variable =
value` mapping e.g.

```toml
avoid-breaking-exported-api = false
disallowed-names = [&quot;toto&quot;, &quot;tata&quot;, &quot;titi&quot;]
```

The [table of configurations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/clippy/lint_configuration.html)
contains all config values, their default, and a list of lints they affect.
Each [configurable lint](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#Configuration)
, also contains information about these values.

For configurations that are a list type with default values such as
[disallowed-names](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#disallowed_names),
you can use the unique value `&quot;..&quot;` to extend the default values instead of replacing them.

```toml
# default of disallowed-names is [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;quux&quot;]
disallowed-names = [&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;..&quot;] # -&gt; [&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;quux&quot;]
```

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; `clippy.toml` or `.clippy.toml` cannot be used to allow/deny lints.

To deactivate the “for further information visit *lint-link*” message you can
define the `CLIPPY_DISABLE_DOCS_LINKS` environment variable.

### Specifying the minimum supported Rust version

Projects that intend to support old versions of Rust can disable lints pertaining to newer features by
specifying the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) in the Clippy configuration file.

```toml
msrv = &quot;1.30.0&quot;
```

Alternatively, the [`rust-version` field](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field)
in the `Cargo.toml` can be used.

```toml
# Cargo.toml
rust-version = &quot;1.30&quot;
```

The MSRV can also be specified as an attribute, like below.

```rust,ignore
#![feature(custom_inner_attributes)]
#![clippy::msrv = &quot;1.30.0&quot;]

fn main() {
  ...
}
```

You can also omit the patch version when specifying the MSRV, so `msrv = 1.30`
is equivalent to `msrv = 1.30.0`.

Note: `custom_inner_attributes` is an unstable feature, so it has to be enabled explicitly.

Lints that recognize this configuration option can be found [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#msrv)

Pronounced **_/u:ˈtoʊ:i.pɑ/_** or **_/u:ˈtoʊˌaɪ.piˈeɪ/_** whatever works better for you.

Want to have your API documented with OpenAPI? But don&#039;t want to be bothered
with manual YAML or JSON tweaking? Would like it to be so easy that it would almost
be utopic? Don&#039;t worry: utoipa is here to fill this gap. It aims to do, if not all, then
most of the heavy lifting for you, enabling you to focus on writing the actual API logic instead of
documentation. It aims to be _minimal_, _simple_ and _fast_. It uses simple `proc` macros which
you can use to annotate your code to have items documented.

The `utoipa` crate provides auto-generated OpenAPI documentation for Rust REST APIs. It treats
code-first approach as a first class citizen and simplifies API documentation by providing
simple macros for generating the documentation from your code.

It also contains Rust types of the OpenAPI spec, allowing you to write the OpenAPI spec only using
Rust if auto generation is not your flavor or does not fit your purpose.

Long term goal of the library is to be the place to go when OpenAPI documentation is needed in any Rust
codebase.

Utoipa is framework-agnostic, and could be used together with any web framework, or even without one. While
being portable and standalone, one of its key aspects is simple integration with web frameworks.

## Choose your flavor and document your API with ice-cold IPA

|Flavor|Support|
|--|--|
|[actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web)|Parse path, path parameters and query parameters, recognize request body and response body, [`utoipa-actix-web` bindings](./utoipa-actix-web/README.md). See more at [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#actix_extras-feature-support-for-actix-web)|
|[axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)|Parse path and query parameters, recognize request body and response body, [`utoipa-axum` bindings](./utoipa-axum/README.md). See more at [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#axum_extras-feature-support-for-axum)|
|[rocket](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket)| Parse path, path parameters and query parameters, recognize request body and response body. See more at [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#rocket_extras-feature-support-for-rocket)|
|Others*| Plain `utoipa` without extra flavor. This gives you all the basic benefits listed below in **[Features](#features)** section but with little less automation.|

&gt; Others* = For example [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) but could be anything.

Refer to the existing [examples](./examples) to find out more.

## Features

* OpenAPI 3.1
* Pluggable, easy setup and integration with frameworks. 
* No bloat, enable what you need.
* Support for generic types
  * **Note!**&lt;br&gt;
    Tuples, arrays and slices cannot be used as generic arguments on types. Types implementing `ToSchema` manually should not have generic arguments, as
    they are not composeable and will result compile error.
* Automatic schema collection from usages recursively. 
  * Request body from either handler function arguments (if supported by framework) or from `request_body` attribute.
  * Response body from response `body` attribute or response `content` attribute.
* Various OpenAPI visualization tools supported out of the box.
* Rust type aliases via [`utoipa-config`](./utoipa-config/README.md).

## What&#039;s up with the word play?

The name comes from the words `utopic` and `api` where `uto` are the first three letters of _utopic_
and the `ipa` is _api_ reversed. Aaand... `ipa` is also an awesome type of beer :beer:.

## Crate Features

- **`macros`** Enable `utoipa-gen` macros. **This is enabled by default.**
- **`yaml`**: Enables **serde_norway** serialization of OpenAPI objects.
- **`actix_extras`**: Enhances [actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web/) integration with being able to
  parse `path`, `path` and `query` parameters from actix web path attribute macros. See
  [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#actix_extras-feature-support-for-actix-web) or [examples](./examples) for more details.
- **`rocket_extras`**: Enhances [rocket](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket) framework integration with being
  able to parse `path`, `path` and `query` parameters from rocket path attribute macros. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#rocket_extras-feature-support-for-rocket)
  or [examples](./examples) for more details.
- **`axum_extras`**: Enhances [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework integration allowing users to use `IntoParams` without
  defining the `parameter_in` attribute. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#axum_extras-feature-support-for-axum)
  or [examples](./examples) for more details.
- **`debug`**: Add extra traits such as debug traits to openapi definitions and elsewhere.
- **`chrono`**: Add support for [chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) `DateTime`, `Date`, `NaiveDate`, `NaiveDateTime`, `NaiveTime` and `Duration`
  types. By default these types are parsed to `string` types with additional `format` information.
  `format: date-time` for `DateTime` and `NaiveDateTime` and `format: date` for `Date` and `NaiveDate` according
  [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6) as `ISO-8601`. To
  override default `string` representation users have to use `value_type` attribute to override the type.
  See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html) for more details.
- **`time`**: Add support for [time](https://crates.io/crates/time) `OffsetDateTime`, `PrimitiveDateTime`, `Date`, and `Duration` types.
  By default these types are parsed as `string`. `OffsetDateTime` and `PrimitiveDateTime` will use `date-time` format. `Date` will use
  `date` format and `Duration` will not have any format. To override default `string` representation users have to use `value_type` attribute
  to override the type. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html) for more details.
- **`decimal`**: Add support for [rust_decimal](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal) `Decimal` type. **By default**
  it is interpreted as `String`. If you wish to change the format you need to override the type.
  See the `value_type` in [component derive docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html).
- **`decimal_float`**: Add support for [rust_decimal](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal) `Decimal` type. **By default**
  it is interpreted as `Number`. This feature is mutually exclusive with **decimal** and allow to change the default type used in your
  documentation for `Decimal` much like `serde_with_float` feature exposed by rust_decimal.
- **`uuid`**: Add support for [uuid](https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid). `Uuid` type will be presented as `String` with
  format `uuid` in OpenAPI spec.
- **`ulid`**: Add support for [ulid](https://github.com/dylanhart/ulid-rs). `Ulid` type will be presented as `String` with
  format `ulid` in OpenAPI spec.
- **`url`**: Add support for [url](https://github.com/servo/rust-url). `Url` type will be presented as `String` with
  format `uri` in OpenAPI spec.
- **`smallvec`**: Add support for [smallvec](https://crates.io/crates/smallvec). `SmallVec` will be treated as `Vec`.
- **`openapi_extensions`**: Adds traits and functions that provide extra convenience functions.
  See the [`request_body` docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/openapi/request_body) for an example.
- **`repr`**: Add support for [repr_serde](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-repr)&#039;s `repr(u*)` and `repr(i*)` attributes to unit type enums for
  C-like enum representation. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html) for more details.
- **`preserve_order`**: Preserve order of properties when serializing the schema for a component.
  When enabled, the properties are listed in order of fields in the corresponding struct definition.
  When disabled, the properties are listed in alphabetical order.
- **`preserve_path_order`**: Preserve order of OpenAPI Paths according to order they have been
  introduced to the `#[openapi(paths(...))]` macro attribute. If disabled the paths will be
  ordered in alphabetical order. **However** the operations order under the path **will** be always constant according to [specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#fixed-fields-6)
- **`indexmap`**: Add support for [indexmap](https://crates.io/crates/indexmap). When enabled `IndexMap` will be rendered as a map similar to
  `BTreeMap` and `HashMap`.
- **`non_strict_integers`**: Add support for non-standard integer formats `int8`, `int16`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, and `uint64`.
- **`rc_schema`**: Add `ToSchema` support for `Arc&lt;T&gt;` and `Rc&lt;T&gt;` types. **Note!** serde `rc` feature flag must be enabled separately to allow
  serialization and deserialization of `Arc&lt;T&gt;` and `Rc&lt;T&gt;` types. See more about [serde feature flags](https://serde.rs/feature-flags.html).
- **`config`** Enables [`utoipa-config`](./utoipa-config/README.md) for the project which allows defining global configuration options for `utoipa`.

### Default Library Support

* Implicit partial support for `serde` attributes. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html#partial-serde-attributes-support) for more details.
* Support for [http](https://crates.io/crates/http) `StatusCode` in responses.

## Install

Add dependency declaration to `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
utoipa = &quot;5&quot;
```

## Examples

_Create type with `ToSchema` and use it in `#[utoipa::path(...)]` that is registered to the `OpenApi`._

```rust
use utoipa::{OpenApi, ToSchema};

#[derive(ToSchema)]
struct Pet {
   id: u64,
   name: String,
   age: Option&lt;i32&gt;,
}

mod pet_api {
    /// Get pet by id
    ///
    /// Get pet from database by pet id
    #[utoipa::path(
        get,
        path = &quot;/pets/{id}&quot;,
        responses(
            (status = 200, description = &quot;Pet found successfully&quot;, body = Pet),
            (status = NOT_FOUND, description = &quot;Pet was not found&quot;)
        ),
        params(
            (&quot;id&quot; = u64, Path, description = &quot;Pet database id to get Pet for&quot;),
        )
    )]
    async fn get_pet_by_id(pet_id: u64) -&gt; Result&lt;Pet, NotFound&gt; {
        Ok(Pet {
            id: pet_id,
            age: None,
            name: &quot;lightning&quot;.to_string(),
        })
    }
}

#[derive(OpenApi)]
#[openapi(paths(pet_api::get_pet_by_id))]
struct ApiDoc;

println!(&quot;{}&quot;, ApiDoc::openapi().to_pretty_json().unwrap());
```

&lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Above example will produce an OpenAPI doc like this:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```json

## Modify OpenAPI at runtime

You can modify generated OpenAPI at runtime either via generated types directly or using
[Modify](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/trait.Modify.html) trait.

_Modify generated OpenAPI via types directly._

```rust
#[derive(OpenApi)]
#[openapi(
    info(description = &quot;My Api description&quot;),
)]
struct ApiDoc;

let mut doc = ApiDoc::openapi();
doc.info.title = String::from(&quot;My Api&quot;);
```

_You can even convert the generated [OpenApi](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/openapi/struct.OpenApi.html) to [OpenApiBuilder](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/openapi/struct.OpenApiBuilder.html)._

```rust
let builder: OpenApiBuilder = ApiDoc::openapi().into();
```

See [Modify](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/trait.Modify.html) trait for examples on how to modify generated OpenAPI via it.

## Go beyond the surface

- See how to serve OpenAPI doc via Swagger UI check [utoipa-swagger-ui](https://docs.rs/utoipa-swagger-ui/) crate for more details.
- Browse to [examples](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/tree/master/examples) for more comprehensive examples.
- Check [IntoResponses](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.IntoResponses.html) and [ToResponse](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToResponse.html) for examples on deriving responses.
- More about OpenAPI security in [security documentation](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/openapi/security/index.html).
- Dump generated API doc to file at build time. See [issue 214 comment](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/issues/214#issuecomment-1179589373).

## FAQ

### Swagger UI returns 404 NotFound from built binary

This is highly probably due to `RustEmbed` not embedding the Swagger UI to the executable. This is natural since the `RustEmbed`
library **does not** by default embed files on debug builds. To get around this you can do one of the following.

1. Build your executable in `--release` mode
2. or add `debug-embed` feature flag to your `Cargo.toml` for `utoipa-swagger-ui`. This will enable the `debug-emebed` feature flag for
   `RustEmbed` as well. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/issues/527#issuecomment-1474219098) and [here](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/issues/268).

Find `utoipa-swagger-ui` [feature flags here](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/tree/master/utoipa-swagger-ui#crate-features).

### How to implement `ToSchema` for external type?

There are few ways around this that are elaborated [here in detail](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/issues/790#issuecomment-1787754185).

### Auto discover for OpenAPI schemas and paths?

Currently there is no build in solution to automatically discover the OpenAPI types but for your luck there is a pretty neat crate that 
just does this for you called [utoipauto](https://github.com/ProbablyClem/utoipauto).

# Native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet

Welcome to the [Rust][rust] implementation of [Apache Arrow], the popular in-memory columnar format.

This repository contains the following crates:

| Crate              | Description                                                                  | Latest API Docs                                  | README                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| [`arrow`]          | Core functionality (memory layout, arrays, low level computations)           | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest)          | [(README)][arrow-readme]          |
| [`arrow-flight`]   | Support for Arrow-Flight IPC protocol                                        | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/arrow-flight/latest)   | [(README)][flight-readme]         |
| [`parquet`]        | Support for Parquet columnar file format                                     | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/parquet/latest)        | [(README)][parquet-readme]        |
| [`parquet_derive`] | A crate for deriving RecordWriter/RecordReader for arbitrary, simple structs | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/parquet-derive/latest) | [(README)][parquet-derive-readme] |

The current development version the API documentation in this repo can be found [here](https://arrow.apache.org/rust).

Note: previously the [`object_store`] crate was also part of this repository,
but it has been moved to the [arrow-rs-object-store repository]

[`arrow`]: https://crates.io/crates/arrow
[`parquet`]: https://crates.io/crates/parquet

[arrow-rs-object-store repository]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs-object-store

## Release Versioning and Schedule

The Arrow Rust project releases approximately monthly and follows [Semantic
Versioning].

Due to available maintainer and testing bandwidth, [`arrow`] crates ([`arrow`],
[`arrow-flight`], etc.) are released on the same schedule with the same versions
as the [`parquet`] and [`parquet-derive`] crates.

This crate releases every month. We release new major versions (with potentially
breaking API changes) at most once a quarter, and release incremental minor
versions in the intervening months. See [ticket #5368] for more details.

To keep our maintenance burden down, we do regularly scheduled releases (major
and minor) from the `main` branch. How we handle PRs with breaking API changes
is described in the [contributing] guide.

[contributing]: CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-changes

Planned Release Schedule

| Approximate Date | Version  | Notes                                   |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Mar 2025         | `54.2.0` | Minor, NO breaking API changes          |
| Apr 2025         | `55.0.0` | Major, potentially breaking API changes |
| May 2025         | `55.1.0` | Minor, NO breaking API changes          |

[ticket #5368]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/5368
[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/

### Rust Version Compatibility Policy

arrow-rs, parquet and object_store are built and tested with stable Rust, and will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) that can only be updated in major releases on a need by basis (e.g. project dependencies bump their MSRV or a particular Rust feature is useful for us etc.). The new MSRV if selected will be at least 6 months old. The minor releases are guaranteed to have the same MSRV.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

E.g.

in Apr 2025 we will release version 55.0.0 which might have a version bump. But the Rust version selected in this case will be at most version 1.81.

### Guidelines for `panic` vs `Result`

In general, use panics for bad states that are unreachable, unrecoverable or harmful.
For those caused by invalid user input, however, we prefer to report that invalidity
gracefully as an error result instead of panicking. In general, invalid input should result
in an `Error` as soon as possible. It _is_ ok for code paths after validation to assume
validation has already occurred and panic if not. See [ticket #6737] for more nuances.

[ticket #6737]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/6737

### Deprecation Guidelines

Minor releases may deprecate, but not remove APIs. Deprecating APIs allows
downstream Rust programs to still compile, but generate compiler warnings. This
gives downstream crates time to migrate prior to API removal.

To deprecate an API:

- Mark the API as deprecated using `#[deprecated]` and specify the exact arrow-rs version in which it was deprecated
- Concisely describe the preferred API to help the user transition

The deprecated version is the next version which will be released (please
consult the list above). To mark the API as deprecated, use the
`#[deprecated(since = &quot;...&quot;, note = &quot;...&quot;)]` attribute.

Foe example

```rust
#[deprecated(since = &quot;51.0.0&quot;, note = &quot;Use `date_part` instead&quot;)]
```

In general, deprecated APIs will remain in the codebase for at least two major releases after
they were deprecated (typically between 6 - 9 months later). For example, an API
deprecated in `51.3.0` can be removed in `54.0.0` (or later). Deprecated APIs
may be removed earlier or later than these guidelines at the discretion of the
maintainers.

[object_store-readme]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs-object-store/blob/main/README.md

Collectively, these crates support a wider array of functionality for analytic computations in Rust.

For example, you can write SQL queries or a `DataFrame` (using the
[`datafusion`] crate) to read a parquet file (using the [`parquet`] crate),
evaluate it in-memory using Arrow&#039;s columnar format (using the [`arrow`] crate),
and send to another process (using the [`arrow-flight`] crate).

Generally speaking, the [`arrow`] crate offers functionality for using Arrow
arrays, and [`datafusion`] offers most operations typically found in SQL,
including `join`s and window functions.

You can find more details about each crate in their respective READMEs.

## Arrow Rust Community

The `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list serves as the core communication channel for the Arrow community. Instructions for signing up and links to the archives can be found on the [Arrow Community](https://arrow.apache.org/community/) page. All major announcements and communications happen there.

The Rust Arrow community also uses the official [ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) for informal discussions and coordination. This is
a great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to contribute. Join us in the `#arrow-rust` channel and feel free to ask for an invite via:

1. the `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list
2. the [GitHub Discussions][discussions]
3. the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YAb2TdazKQ)

The Rust implementation uses [GitHub issues][issues] as the system of record for new features and bug fixes and
this plays a critical role in the release process.

For design discussions we generally use GitHub issues.

![architecture](docs/assets/architecture.svg)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- MacOS
  - Xcode 13 or later
  - Brew

### 1. Clone repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-for-command-line.git
```

### 2. Install platform dependencies

This is all the dep

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config jq dpkg curl wget cmake clang libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libdbus-1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev valac libibus-1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev sqlite3 libxdo-dev protobuf-compiler
```

For Arch:

```shell
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S --needed webkit2gtk base-devel curl wget openssl appmenu-gtk-module gtk3 libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg libvips cmake jq pkgconf
```

For Fedora:

```shell
sudo dnf check-update
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk3-devel.x86_64 openssl-devel curl wget libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg2-devel jq
sudo dnf group install &quot;C Development Tools and Libraries&quot;
```

For MacOS:

```shell
xcode-select --install
brew install mise pnpm protobuf zsh bash fish shellcheck jq
```

### 2. Install Rust toolchain using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs):

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

For pre-commit hooks, the following commands are required:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install typos-cli
```

For MacOS development make sure the right targets are installed:

```shell
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Setup Python and Node using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Add mise integrations to your shell:

For zsh:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; &quot;${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc&quot;
```

For bash:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
```

For fish:
```shell
echo &#039;mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Install the Python and Node toolchains using:

```shell
mise trust
mise install
```

### 4. Setup precommit hooks

Run `pnpm` in root directory to add pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

## 💡 Quick Tip for Onboarding

Use Q CLI to help you onboard Q CLI! 

Start a `q chat` session:

```shell
q chat
```

Once inside `q chat`, you can supply project context by adding the [`codebase-summary.md`](codebase-summary.md) file:

```shell
/context add codebase-summary.md
```

This enables Q to answer onboarding questions like:

- “What does this crate do?”

- “Where is X implemented?”

- “How do these components interact?”

Great for speeding up your ramp-up and navigating the repo more effectively.

This is a simple graphical user interface for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (an
aggressively refactored and updated Vim editor). Where possible there are some graphical
improvements, but functionally it should act like the terminal UI.

## Author Notes

I&#039;ve been using this as my daily driver since November 2019. It should be relatively stable, but I&#039;m
still working out some kinks and ironing out some cross platform issues. In general it should be
usable at this point, and if it isn&#039;t I consider that a bug and appreciate a report in the issues!
Any help and ideas are also greatly appreciated.

I&#039;m also very interested in suggestions code quality/style wise when it comes to Rust. I&#039;m pretty
new to the language and appreciate any critiques that you might have to offer. I won&#039;t take all of
them, but I promise to consider anything you might have to offer.

## Polars: Blazingly fast DataFrames in Rust, Python, Node.js, R, and SQL

Polars is a DataFrame interface on top of an OLAP Query Engine implemented in Rust using
[Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html) as the memory
model.

- Lazy | eager execution
- Multi-threaded
- SIMD
- Query optimization
- Powerful expression API
- Hybrid Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Rust | Python | NodeJS | R | ...

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Python

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import polars as pl
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pl.DataFrame(
...     {
...         &quot;A&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
...         &quot;fruits&quot;: [&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;],
...         &quot;B&quot;: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
...         &quot;cars&quot;: [&quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;audi&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;],
...     }
... )

# embarrassingly parallel execution &amp; very expressive query language
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.sort(&quot;fruits&quot;).select(
...     &quot;fruits&quot;,
...     &quot;cars&quot;,
...     pl.lit(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;literal_string_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;B&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;cars&quot;) == &quot;beetle&quot;).sum(),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;B&quot;) &gt; 2).sum().over(&quot;cars&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_cars&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sum().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).reverse().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;rev_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sort_by(&quot;B&quot;).over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sort_A_by_B_by_fruits&quot;),
... )

...     df2.blooming_season
... FROM df
... LEFT JOIN df2 ON df.species = df2.species
... GROUP BY df.species, df2.blooming_season
... &quot;&quot;&quot;).collect()
```

SQL commands can also be run directly from your terminal using the Polars CLI:

```bash
# run an inline SQL query
&gt; polars -c &quot;SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;&quot;

# run interactively
&gt; polars
Polars CLI v0.3.0
Type .help for help.

&gt; SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;
```

Refer to the [Polars CLI repository](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-cli) for more information.

## Performance 🚀🚀

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is
still very fast!)

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

We also have a conda package (`conda install -c conda-forge polars`), however pip is the preferred
way to install Polars.

Install Polars with all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[all]&#039;
```

You can also install a subset of all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[numpy,pandas,pyarrow]&#039;
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating Polars regularly to
get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features /
performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```toml
polars = { git = &quot;https://github.com/pola-rs/polars&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;optional git tag&gt;&quot; }
```

Requires Rust version `&gt;=1.80`.

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

JSON is a ubiquitous open-standard format that uses human-readable text to
transmit data objects consisting of key-value pairs.

```json
{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
    &quot;age&quot;: 43,
    &quot;address&quot;: {
        &quot;street&quot;: &quot;10 Downing Street&quot;,
        &quot;city&quot;: &quot;London&quot;
    },
    &quot;phones&quot;: [
        &quot;+44 1234567&quot;,
        &quot;+44 2345678&quot;
    ]
}
```

There are three common ways that you might find yourself needing to work with
JSON data in Rust.

 - **As text data.** An unprocessed string of JSON data that you receive on an
   HTTP endpoint, read from a file, or prepare to send to a remote server.
 - **As an untyped or loosely typed representation.** Maybe you want to check
   that some JSON data is valid before passing it on, but without knowing the
   structure of what it contains. Or you want to do very basic manipulations
   like insert a key in a particular spot.
 - **As a strongly typed Rust data structure.** When you expect all or most of
   your data to conform to a particular structure and want to get real work done
   without JSON&#039;s loosey-goosey nature tripping you up.

Serde JSON provides efficient, flexible, safe ways of converting data between
each of these representations.

## Operating on untyped JSON values

Any valid JSON data can be manipulated in the following recursive enum
representation. This data structure is [`serde_json::Value`][value].

```rust
enum Value {
    Null,
    Bool(bool),
    Number(Number),
    String(String),
    Array(Vec&lt;Value&gt;),
    Object(Map&lt;String, Value&gt;),
}
```

A string of JSON data can be parsed into a `serde_json::Value` by the
[`serde_json::from_str`][from_str] function. There is also
[`from_slice`][from_slice] for parsing from a byte slice `&amp;[u8]` and
[`from_reader`][from_reader] for parsing from any `io::Read` like a File or a
TCP stream.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=d69d8e3156d4bb81c4461b60b772ab72&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
use serde_json::{Result, Value};

fn untyped_example() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // Some JSON input data as a &amp;str. Maybe this comes from the user.
    let data = r#&quot;
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
            &quot;age&quot;: 43,
            &quot;phones&quot;: [
                &quot;+44 1234567&quot;,
                &quot;+44 2345678&quot;
            ]
        }&quot;#;

    // Parse the string of data into serde_json::Value.
    let v: Value = serde_json::from_str(data)?;

    // Access parts of the data by indexing with square brackets.
    println!(&quot;Please call {} at the number {}&quot;, v[&quot;name&quot;], v[&quot;phones&quot;][0]);

    Ok(())
}
```

The result of square bracket indexing like `v[&quot;name&quot;]` is a borrow of the data
at that index, so the type is `&amp;Value`. A JSON map can be indexed with string
keys, while a JSON array can be indexed with integer keys. If the type of the
data is not right for the type with which it is being indexed, or if a map does
not contain the key being indexed, or if the index into a vector is out of
bounds, the returned element is `Value::Null`.

When a `Value` is printed, it is printed as a JSON string. So in the code above,
the output looks like `Please call &quot;John Doe&quot; at the number &quot;+44 1234567&quot;`. The
quotation marks appear because `v[&quot;name&quot;]` is a `&amp;Value` containing a JSON
string and its JSON representation is `&quot;John Doe&quot;`. Printing as a plain string
without quotation marks involves converting from a JSON string to a Rust string
with [`as_str()`] or avoiding the use of `Value` as described in the following
section.

[`as_str()`]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/1/serde_json/enum.Value.html#method.as_str

The `Value` representation is sufficient for very basic tasks but can be tedious
to work with for anything more significant. Error handling is verbose to
implement correctly, for example imagine trying to detect the presence of
unrecognized fields in the input data. The compiler is powerless to help you
when you make a mistake, for example imagine typoing `v[&quot;name&quot;]` as `v[&quot;nmae&quot;]`
in one of the dozens of places it is used in your code.

## Parsing JSON as strongly typed data structures

Serde provides a powerful way of mapping JSON data into Rust data structures
largely automatically.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=15cfab66d38ff8a15a9cf1d8d897ac68&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use serde_json::Result;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    phones: Vec&lt;String&gt;,
}

fn typed_example() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // Some JSON input data as a &amp;str. Maybe this comes from the user.
    let data = r#&quot;
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
            &quot;age&quot;: 43,
            &quot;phones&quot;: [
                &quot;+44 1234567&quot;,
                &quot;+44 2345678&quot;
            ]
        }&quot;#;

    // Parse the string of data into a Person object. This is exactly the
    // same function as the one that produced serde_json::Value above, but
    // now we are asking it for a Person as output.
    let p: Person = serde_json::from_str(data)?;

    // Do things just like with any other Rust data structure.
    println!(&quot;Please call {} at the number {}&quot;, p.name, p.phones[0]);

    Ok(())
}
```

This is the same `serde_json::from_str` function as before, but this time we
assign the return value to a variable of type `Person` so Serde will
automatically interpret the input data as a `Person` and produce informative
error messages if the layout does not conform to what a `Person` is expected to
look like.

Any type that implements Serde&#039;s `Deserialize` trait can be deserialized this
way. This includes built-in Rust standard library types like `Vec&lt;T&gt;` and
`HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;`, as well as any structs or enums annotated with
`#[derive(Deserialize)]`.

Once we have `p` of type `Person`, our IDE and the Rust compiler can help us use
it correctly like they do for any other Rust code. The IDE can autocomplete
field names to prevent typos, which was impossible in the `serde_json::Value`
representation. And the Rust compiler can check that when we write
`p.phones[0]`, then `p.phones` is guaranteed to be a `Vec&lt;String&gt;` so indexing
into it makes sense and produces a `String`.

The necessary setup for using Serde&#039;s derive macros is explained on the *[Using
derive]* page of the Serde site.

[Using derive]: https://serde.rs/derive.html

## Constructing JSON values

Serde JSON provides a [`json!` macro][macro] to build `serde_json::Value`
objects with very natural JSON syntax.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=6ccafad431d72b62e77cc34c8e879b24&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
use serde_json::json;

fn main() {
    // The type of `john` is `serde_json::Value`
    let john = json!({
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
        &quot;age&quot;: 43,
        &quot;phones&quot;: [
            &quot;+44 1234567&quot;,
            &quot;+44 2345678&quot;
        ]
    });

    println!(&quot;first phone number: {}&quot;, john[&quot;phones&quot;][0]);

    // Convert to a string of JSON and print it out
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, john.to_string());
}
```

The `Value::to_string()` function converts a `serde_json::Value` into a `String`
of JSON text.

One neat thing about the `json!` macro is that variables and expressions can be
interpolated directly into the JSON value as you are building it. Serde will
check at compile time that the value you are interpolating is able to be
represented as JSON.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=f9101a6e61dfc9e02c6a67f315ed24f2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
let full_name = &quot;John Doe&quot;;
let age_last_year = 42;

// The type of `john` is `serde_json::Value`
let john = json!({
    &quot;name&quot;: full_name,
    &quot;age&quot;: age_last_year + 1,
    &quot;phones&quot;: [
        format!(&quot;+44 {}&quot;, random_phone())
    ]
});
```

This is amazingly convenient, but we have the problem we had before with
`Value`: the IDE and Rust compiler cannot help us if we get it wrong. Serde JSON
provides a better way of serializing strongly-typed data structures into JSON
text.

## Creating JSON by serializing data structures

A data structure can be converted to a JSON string by
[`serde_json::to_string`][to_string]. There is also
[`serde_json::to_vec`][to_vec] which serializes to a `Vec&lt;u8&gt;` and
[`serde_json::to_writer`][to_writer] which serializes to any `io::Write`
such as a File or a TCP stream.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=3472242a08ed2ff88a944f2a2283b0ee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use serde_json::Result;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Address {
    street: String,
    city: String,
}

fn print_an_address() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // Some data structure.
    let address = Address {
        street: &quot;10 Downing Street&quot;.to_owned(),
        city: &quot;London&quot;.to_owned(),
    };

    // Serialize it to a JSON string.
    let j = serde_json::to_string(&amp;address)?;

    // Print, write to a file, or send to an HTTP server.
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, j);

    Ok(())
}
```

Any type that implements Serde&#039;s `Serialize` trait can be serialized this way.
This includes built-in Rust standard library types like `Vec&lt;T&gt;` and `HashMap&lt;K,
V&gt;`, as well as any structs or enums annotated with `#[derive(Serialize)]`.

## Performance

It is fast. You should expect in the ballpark of 500 to 1000 megabytes per
second deserialization and 600 to 900 megabytes per second serialization,
depending on the characteristics of your data. This is competitive with the
fastest C and C++ JSON libraries or even 30% faster for many use cases.
Benchmarks live in the [serde-rs/json-benchmark] repo.

## No-std support

As long as there is a memory allocator, it is possible to use serde_json without
the rest of the Rust standard library. Disable the default &quot;std&quot; feature and
enable the &quot;alloc&quot; feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde_json = { version = &quot;1.0&quot;, default-features = false, features = [&quot;alloc&quot;] }
```

For JSON support in Serde without a memory allocator, please see the
[`serde-json-core`] crate.

Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

Lapce (IPA: /læps/) is written in pure Rust with a UI in [Floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor) which makes for lightning-fast computation, and leverages [Wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering. More information about the features of Lapce can be found on the [main website](https://lapce.dev) and user documentation can be found on [GitBook](https://docs.lapce.dev/).

![](https://github.com/lapce/lapce/blob/master/extra/images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Features

* Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
* Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Enjoy the benefits of a &quot;local&quot; experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system. We also have [Lapdev](https://lap.dev/) which can help manage your remote dev environments. 
* Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.

## Serde in action

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Click to show Cargo.toml.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=72755f28f99afc95e01d63174b28c1f5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Run this code in the playground.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;

```toml
[dependencies]

# The core APIs, including the Serialize and Deserialize traits. Always
# required when using Serde. The &quot;derive&quot; feature is only required when
# using #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] to make Serde work with structs
# and enums defined in your crate.
serde = { version = &quot;1.0&quot;, features = [&quot;derive&quot;] }

# Each data format lives in its own crate; the sample code below uses JSON
# but you may be using a different one.
serde_json = &quot;1.0&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

    // Convert the Point to a JSON string.
    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&amp;point).unwrap();

    // Prints serialized = {&quot;x&quot;:1,&quot;y&quot;:2}
    println!(&quot;serialized = {}&quot;, serialized);

    // Convert the JSON string back to a Point.
    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&amp;serialized).unwrap();

    // Prints deserialized = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }
    println!(&quot;deserialized = {:?}&quot;, deserialized);
}
```

## Getting help

Serde is one of the most widely used Rust libraries so any place that Rustaceans
congregate will be able to help you out. For chat, consider trying the
[#rust-questions] or [#rust-beginners] channels of the unofficial community
Discord (invite: &lt;https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community&gt;), the [#rust-usage] or
[#beginners] channels of the official Rust Project Discord (invite:
&lt;https://discord.gg/rust-lang&gt;), or the [#general][zulip] stream in Zulip. For
asynchronous, consider the [\[rust\] tag on StackOverflow][stackoverflow], the
[/r/rust] subreddit which has a pinned weekly easy questions post, or the Rust
[Discourse forum][discourse]. It&#039;s acceptable to file a support issue in this
repo but they tend not to get as many eyes as any of the above and may get
closed without a response after some time.
