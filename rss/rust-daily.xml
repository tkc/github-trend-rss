## About

### What is FHEVM?

**FHEVM** is the core framework of the *Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol*. It enables confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing encrypted data to be processed directly onchain.

FHEVM ensures both confidentiality and composability, with the following guarantees:
- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn&#039;t impact existing dApps.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Project structure
The directories of this repository are organized in the following way:

###### FHEVM Contracts

- **`gateway-contracts/`**: Smart contracts managing the gateway between on-chain and off-chain components.

- **`host-contracts/`**: Smart Contracts deployed on the host chain for orchestrating FHE workflows.

###### FHEVM Compute Engines

- **`coprocessor/`**: Rust-based coprocessor implementation for FHE operations.

- **`kms-connector/`**: Interface for integrating with Key Management Services (KMS) to handle encryption keys securely.

###### FHEVM Utilities
- **`charts/`**: Helm charts and deployment configurations for the stack.

- **`golden-container-images/`**: Docker golden images for Node.js and Rust environments used as base images by the stack.

- **`test-suite/`**: Integration with docker-compose and tests covering end-to-end FHEVM stack behavior.



  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
### Main features

- **Privacy by design:** Building decentralized apps with full privacy and confidentiality on Ethereum, leveraging FHE.
- **Solidity integration:** Write FHEVM contracts like any standard Solidity contract using Solidity. Compatible with existing toolchains — such as Hardhat and Foundry (*coming soon*).
- **Programmable privacy:**  Define exactly what data is encrypted and write the access control logic directly in your smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers.
- **Full range of operators:** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, ternary-if, boolean operations…. Consecutive FHE operations are not limited.
- **Security:** The underlying FHE crypto-scheme of FHEVM is quantum-resistant. Decryption is managed via a key management system (KMS) using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring security even if some parties are compromised or misbehaving.
- **Symbolic execution of FHE computations:** All FHE operations are executed symbolically on the host chain, significantly reducing execution time. The actual computations on encrypted data are offloaded asynchronously to our coprocessor, allowing for faster, efficient, and scalable processing.

_Learn more about FHEVM features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) and in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/fhevm-whitepaper.pdf)._
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Use cases

FHEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without the need to learn cryptography. Leveraging FHEVM, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFi, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Confidential transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.
- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.

_Learn more use cases in the [list of examples](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/examples)._

## Prerequisites

See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for software requirements to develop in this repo.

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX

# Set the path of the future wallet.
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[1]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[1]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;
```

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[wcc]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/
[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any
questions, or want to talk about future plans, please join us on Discord

start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [colocated local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#colocated-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily restore to
an earlier repo state, simply undo your operations one-by-one or even _revert_ a
particular operation which does not have to be the most recent one.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

**This software is still in an early stage of development. Check out the issues, and feel free to contribute!**

## Summary

This is a complete rewrite in Rust of the [UAD project](https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater),
which aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary
and obscure system apps.
This can also contribute to improve security by reducing [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface).

Packages are as well documented as possible in order to provide a better
understanding of what you can delete or not. The worst issue that could happen
is removing an essential system package needed during boot causing then an unfortunate
bootloop. After about 5 failed system boots, the phone will automatically reboot
in recovery mode, and you&#039;ll have to perform a FACTORY RESET. Make a backup first!

In any case, you **CANNOT** brick your device with this software!
That&#039;s the main point, right?

## Features

- [x] Uninstall/Disable and Restore/Enable system packages
- [x] Multi-user support (e.g. apps in work profiles)
- [x] Export/Import your selection in `uad_exported_selection.txt`
- [x] Multi-device support: you can connect multiple phones at the same time
- [x] All your actions are logged, so you never forget what you&#039;ve done

NB : System apps cannot truly be uninstalled without root (see the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ))

  ```bash
  sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools
  ```

  Arch-Linux Base:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S android-tools
  ```

  Red Hat Base:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install android-tools
  ```

  OpenSUSE Base:

  ```bash
  sudo zypper install android-tools
  ```

  &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;MAC OS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Install _Android platform tools_

    ```bash

    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;WINDOWS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Download [android platform tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)
    and unzip it somewhere.
  - [Add the android platform tools to your PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)
    **OR** make sure to launch UAD from the same directory.

  - [Install USB drivers for your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#Drivers)
  - Check your device is detected:

    ```bash
     adb devices
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

- Download the latest release of UAD GUI for your Operating System [here](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/releases).
  Take the `opengl` version only if the default version (with a Vulkan backend)
  doesn&#039;t launch.

**NOTE:** Chinese phones users may need to use the AOSP list for removing some stock
apps because those Chinese manufacturers (especially Xiaomi and Huawei) have been
using the name of AOSP packages for their own (modified &amp; closed-source) apps.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You will have to run this software whenever your OEM pushes
an update to your phone as some _uninstalled_ system apps could be reinstalled.

## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic —  with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting, enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

developer/user communities.
However, Python has performance and typing limitations for large-scale, latency-sensitive systems. Cython addresses many of these issues by introducing static typing into Python&#039;s rich ecosystem of libraries and communities.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

**NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** or on demand.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels **ship** in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

**Note**: Wheels from the `develop` branch are only built for the Linux x86_64 platform to save time
and compute resources, while `nightly` wheels support additional platforms as shown below.

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | -       |

This process also helps preserve compute resources and ensures easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212` for December 12, 2024):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.208.0a20241212 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mullvad VPN desktop and mobile app

Welcome to the Mullvad VPN client app source code repository.
This is the VPN client software for the Mullvad VPN service.
For more information about the service, please visit our website,
[mullvad.net](https://mullvad.net) (Also accessible via Tor on our
[onion service](http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/)).

This repository contains all the source code for the
desktop and mobile versions of the app. For desktop this includes the system service/daemon
([`mullvad-daemon`](mullvad-daemon/)), a graphical user interface ([GUI](desktop/)) and a command
line interface ([CLI](mullvad-cli/)). The Android app uses the same backing system service for the
tunnel and security but has a dedicated frontend in [android/](android/). iOS consists of a
completely standalone implementation that resides in [ios/](ios/).

## Releases

There are built and signed releases for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android available on
[our website](https://mullvad.net/download/) and on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases/). The Android app is also available
on [Google Play] and [F-Droid] and the iOS version on [App Store].

[Google Play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mullvad.mullvadvpn
[F-Droid]: https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn/
[App Store]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mullvad-vpn/id1488466513

You can find our code signing keys as well as instructions for how to cryptographically verify
your download on [Mullvad&#039;s Open Source page].

### Platform/OS support

These are the operating systems and their versions that the app officially supports. It might
work on many more versions, but we don&#039;t test for those and can&#039;t guarantee the quality or
security.

| OS/Platform | Supported versions |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Windows     | 10 and 11          |
| macOS       | The three latest major releases |
| Linux (Ubuntu)| The two latest LTS releases and the latest non-LTS releases |
| Linux (Fedora) | The versions that are not yet [EOL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life) |
| Linux (Debian) | 12 and newer    |
| Android     | 8 and newer        |
| iOS         | 15.0 and newer     |

On Linux we test using the Gnome desktop environment. The app should, and probably does work
in other DEs, but we don&#039;t regularly test those.

## Features

Here is a table containing the features of the app across platforms. This is intended to reflect
the current state of the latest code in git, not necessarily any existing release.

## Security and anonymity

This app is a privacy preserving VPN client. As such it goes to great lengths to stop traffic
leaks. And basically all settings default to the more secure/private option. The user has to
explicitly allow more loose rules if desired. See the [dedicated security document] for details
on what the app blocks and allows, as well as how it does it.

[dedicated security document]: docs/security.md

## Checking out the code

This repository contains submodules needed for building the app. However, some of those submodules
also have further submodules that are quite large and not needed to build the app. So unless
you want the source code for OpenSSL, OpenVPN and a few other projects you should avoid a recursive
clone of the repository. Instead clone the repository normally and then get one level of submodules:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app.git
cd mullvadvpn-app
git submodule update --init
```

On Android, Windows, Linux and macOS you also want to checkout the wireguard-go submodule:
```bash
git submodule update --init wireguard-go-rs/libwg/wireguard-go
```
Further details on why this is necessary can be found in the [wireguard-go-rs crate](./wireguard-go-rs/README.md).

We sign every commit on the `main` branch as well as our release tags. If you would like to verify
your checkout, you can find our developer keys on [Mullvad&#039;s Open Source page].

### Binaries submodule

This repository has a git submodule at `dist-assets/binaries`. This submodule contains binaries and
build scripts for third party code we need to bundle with the app. Such as OpenVPN, Wintun
etc.

This submodule conforms to the same integrity/security standards as this repository. Every merge
commit should be signed. And this main repository should only ever point to a signed merge commit
of the binaries submodule.

See the [binaries submodule&#039;s](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app-binaries) README for more
details about that repository.

## Building the app

See the [build instructions](BuildInstructions.md) for help building the app on desktop platforms.

For building the Android app, see the [instructions](./android/BuildInstructions.md) for Android.

For building the iOS app, see the [instructions](./ios/BuildInstructions.md) for iOS.

## Releasing the app

See [this](Release.md) for instructions on how to make a new release.

## Environment variables used by the service

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DEBUG` - Helps debugging the firewall. Does different things depending on
  platform:
  * Linux: Set to `&quot;1&quot;` to add packet counters to all firewall rules.
  * macOS: Makes rules log the packets they match to the `pflog0` interface.
    * Set to `&quot;all&quot;` to add logging to all rules.
    * Set to `&quot;pass&quot;` to add logging to rules allowing packets.
    * Set to `&quot;drop&quot;` to add logging to rules blocking packets.

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_SRC_VALID_MARK` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from
    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark` kernel parameter to `1` on Linux when a tunnel
    is established.
    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise strict reverse path filtering
    may prevent relay traffic from reaching the daemon. If `rp_filter` is set to `1` on the interface
    that will be receiving relay traffic, and `src_valid_mark` is not set to `1`, the daemon will
    not be able to receive relay traffic.

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_ARP_IGNORE` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from
    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` kernel parameter to `2` on Linux when a tunnel
    is established.
    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise an attacker who can send ARP
    requests to the device running Mullvad can figure out the in-tunnel IP.

* `TALPID_DNS_MODULE` - Allows changing the method that will be used for DNS configuration.
  By default this is automatically detected, but you can set it to one of the options below to
  choose a specific method.

  * Linux
    * `&quot;static-file&quot;`: change the `/etc/resolv.conf` file directly
    * `&quot;resolvconf&quot;`: use the `resolvconf` program
    * `&quot;systemd&quot;`: use systemd&#039;s `resolved` service through DBus
    * `&quot;network-manager&quot;`: use `NetworkManager` service through DBus

  * Windows
    * `iphlpapi`: use the IP helper API
    * `netsh`: use the `netsh` program
    * `tcpip`: set TCP/IP parameters in the registry

* `TALPID_DISABLE_LOCAL_DNS_RESOLVER` - Set this variable to `1` to disable the local DNS resolver
  (macOS only).

* `TALPID_NEVER_FILTER_AAAA_QUERIES` - Set this variable to `1` to never ignore DNS AAAA queries
  (macOS only).

* `TALPID_FORCE_USERSPACE_WIREGUARD` - Forces the daemon to use the userspace implementation of
   WireGuard on Linux.

* `TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR` - Forces the daemon to always assume the host is online.

* `TALPID_NET_CLS_MOUNT_DIR` - On Linux, forces the daemon to mount the `net_cls` controller in the
  specified directory if it isn&#039;t mounted already.

* `MULLVAD_MANAGEMENT_SOCKET_GROUP` - On Linux and macOS, this restricts access to the management
  interface UDS socket to users in the specified group. This means that only users in that group can
  use the CLI and GUI. By default, everyone has access to the socket.

* `MULLVAD_BACKTRACE_ON_FAULT` - When enabled, if the daemon encounters a fault (e.g. `SIGSEGV`),
  it will log a backtrace to stdout, and to `daemon.log`. By default, this is disabled in
  release-builds and enabled in debug-builds. Set variable to `1` or `0` to explicitly enable or
  disable this feature. Logging the backtrace causes heap allocation. Allocation is not signal safe,
  but here it runs in the signal handler. This is technically undefined behavior and therefore
  disabled by default. This usually works, but enable at your own risk.

### Development builds only

* `MULLVAD_API_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in API requests. E.g. `api.mullvad.net`.

* `MULLVAD_API_ADDR` - Set the IP address and port to use in API requests. E.g. `10.10.1.2:443`.

* `MULLVAD_API_DISABLE_TLS` - Use plain HTTP for API requests.

* `MULLVAD_CONNCHECK_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in connection check requests. E.g. `am.i.mullvad.net`.

* `MULLVAD_ENABLE_DEV_UPDATES` - Enable version checks in development builds.

### Setting environment variables

#### Windows

Use `setx` from an elevated shell:

```bat
setx TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE 1 /m
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bat
sc.exe stop mullvadvpn
sc.exe start mullvadvpn
```

#### Linux

Edit the systemd unit file via `systemctl edit mullvad-daemon.service`:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=&quot;TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR=1&quot;
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mullvad-daemon
```

#### macOS

Use `plutil`:

```bash
sudo plutil -replace EnvironmentVariables -json &#039;{&quot;TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR&quot;: &quot;1&quot;}&#039; /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bash
launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
```

## Environment variables used by the desktop frontend

* `MULLVAD_PATH` - Allows changing the path to the folder with the `mullvad-problem-report` tool
   when running in development mode. Defaults to: `&lt;repo&gt;/target/debug/`.
* `MULLVAD_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION` - If set to `1`, notification will be disabled when
   an update is available.


## Command line tools for Electron app development

- `$ npm run develop` - develop app with live-reload enabled
- `$ npm run lint` - lint code
- `$ npm run pack:&lt;OS&gt;` - prepare app for distribution for your platform. Where `&lt;OS&gt;` can be
  `linux`, `mac` or `win`
- `$ npm test` - run tests


## Tray icon on Linux

The requirements for displaying a tray icon vary between different desktop environments. If the
tray icon doesn&#039;t appear, try installing one of these packages:
- `libappindicator3-1`
- `libappindicator1`
- `libappindicator`

If you&#039;re using GNOME, try installing one of these GNOME Shell extensions:
- `TopIconsFix`
- `TopIcons Plus`

### Mullvad Daemon

The daemon is implemented in Rust and is implemented in several crates. The main, or top level,
crate that builds the final daemon binary is `mullvad-daemon` which then depend on the others.

In general one can look at the daemon as split into two parts, the crates starting with `talpid`
and the crates starting with `mullvad`. The `talpid` crates are supposed to be completely unrelated
to Mullvad specific things. A `talpid` crate is not allowed to know anything about the API through
which the daemon fetch Mullvad account details or download VPN server lists for example. The
`talpid` components should be viewed as a generic VPN client with extra privacy and anonymity
preserving features. The crates having `mullvad` in their name on the other hand make use of the
`talpid` components to build a secure and Mullvad specific VPN client.


- **Cargo.toml** - Main Rust workspace definition. See this file for which folders here are daemon
  Rust crates.
- **mullvad-daemon/** - Main Rust crate building the daemon binary.
- **talpid-core/** - Main crate of the VPN client implementation itself. Completely Mullvad agnostic
  privacy preserving VPN client library.


## Vocabulary

Explanations for some common words used in the documentation and code in this repository.

- **App** - This entire product (everything in this repository) is the &quot;Mullvad VPN App&quot;, or App for
  short.
  - **Daemon** - Refers to the `mullvad-daemon` Rust program. This headless program exposes a
    management interface that can be used to control the daemon
  - **Frontend** - Term used for any program or component that connects to the daemon management
    interface and allows a user to control the daemon.
    - **GUI** - The Electron + React program that is a graphical frontend for the Mullvad VPN App.
    - **CLI** - The Rust program named `mullvad` that is a terminal based frontend for the Mullvad
      VPN app.


## File paths used by Mullvad VPN app

A list of file paths written to and read from by the various components of the Mullvad VPN app

### Daemon

On Windows, when a process runs as a system service the variable `%LOCALAPPDATA%` expands to
`C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local`.

All directory paths are defined in, and fetched from, the `mullvad-paths` crate.

#### Settings

The settings directory can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_SETTINGS_DIR` environment variable.

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `/etc/mullvad-vpn/` |
| macOS | `/etc/mullvad-vpn/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mullvad VPN\` |
| Android | [`getFilesDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getFilesDir()) |

#### Logs

The log directory can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_LOG_DIR` environment variable.

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `/var/log/mullvad-vpn/` + systemd |

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ — the state of your application
* __Messages__ — user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ — a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ — a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(&quot;A cool counter&quot;, Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

Read the [book], the [documentation], and the [examples] to learn more!

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio&#039;s zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust&#039;s ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system&#039;s event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc.).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

[net]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html
[scheduler]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you activated the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1.47.1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&amp;mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(0) =&gt; return,
                    Ok(n) =&gt; n,
                    Err(e) =&gt; {
                        eprintln!(&quot;failed to read from socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&amp;buf[0..n]).await {
                    eprintln!(&quot;failed to write to socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Supported Rust Versions

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- tokio/README.md
- tokio/Cargo.toml
- tokio-util/Cargo.toml
- tokio-test/Cargo.toml
- tokio-stream/Cargo.toml
--&gt;

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.70.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.39 to now  - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn&#039;t follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

 * `1.43.x` - LTS release until March 2026. (MSRV 1.70)
 * `1.47.x` - LTS release until September 2026. (MSRV 1.70)

Each LTS release will continue to receive backported fixes for at least a year.
If you wish to use a fixed minor release in your project, we recommend that you
use an LTS release.

To use a fixed minor version, you can specify the version with a tilde. For
example, to specify that you wish to use the newest `1.43.x` patch release, you
can use the following dependency specification:
```text
tokio = { version = &quot;~1.43&quot;, features = [...] }
```

### Previous LTS releases

 * `1.8.x` - LTS release until February 2022.
 * `1.14.x` - LTS release until June 2022.
 * `1.18.x` - LTS release until June 2023.
 * `1.20.x` - LTS release until September 2023.
 * `1.25.x` - LTS release until March 2024.
 * `1.32.x` - LTS release until September 2024.
 * `1.36.x` - LTS release until March 2025.
 * `1.38.x` - LTS release until July 2025.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

HelixDB was built on the thesis that current database infrastructure is built for how humans think about data, not AI. So we&#039;ve built a database that makes it easy to build all the components needed for an AI application in a single platform.

You no longer need a separate application DB, vector DB, graph DB, or application layers to manage the multiple storage locations. All you need to build any application that uses AI, agents or RAG, is a single HelixDB cluster and HelixQL; we take care of the rest.

HelixDB primarily operates with a graph + vector data model, but it can also support support KV, documents, and relational data.

## Key Features

|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Built-in MCP tools**           | Helix has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than having to generate human readable queries, letting agents actually think. |
| **Built-in Embeddings**          | Don&#039;t worry about needing to embed your data before sending it to Helix, just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text.                                                     |
| **Tooling for Knowledge Graphs** | It is super easy to ingest your unstructured data into a knowledge graph, with our integrations for Zep-AI&#039;s Graphiti, and our own implementation of OpenAI&#039;s KG tool.        |
| **Tooling for RAG**              | HelixDB has a built-in vector search, keyword search, and hybrid search that can be used to power your RAG applications.                                                      |
| **Secure by Default**            | HelixDB is private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled HelixQL queries.                                                                           |
| **Logical Isolation**            | Each Helix cluster is logically isolated in its own VPC meaning only you can ever see your data.                                                                              |
| **Ultra-Low Latency**            | Helix is built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.                                                                                |

## Getting Started

#### Helix CLI

The Helix CLI tool can be used to check, compile and deploy Helix locally.

1. Install CLI

   ```bash
   curl -sSL &quot;https://install.helix-db.com&quot; | bash
   ```

2. Install Helix

   ```bash
   helix install
   ```

3. Setup

   ```bash
   helix init --path &lt;path-to-project&gt;
   ```

4. Write queries

   Open your newly created `.hx` files and start writing your schema and queries.
   Head over to [our docs](https://docs.helix-db.com/introduction/cookbook/basic) for more information about writing queries

   ```js
   QUERY addUser(name: String, age: I64) =&gt;
      user &lt;- AddN&lt;User&gt;({name: name, age: age})
      RETURN user

   QUERY getUser(user_name: String) =&gt;
      user &lt;- N&lt;User&gt;::WHERE(_::{name}::EQ(user_name))
      RETURN user
   ```

5. Check your queries compile before building them into API endpoints (optional)

   ```bash
   # in ./&lt;path-to-project&gt;
   helix check
   ```

6. Deploy your queries

   ```bash
   # in ./&lt;path-to-project&gt;
   helix deploy
   ```

7. Start calling them using our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-ts) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py). For example:

   ```typescript
   import HelixDB from &quot;helix-ts&quot;;

   // Create a new HelixDB client
   // The default port is 6969
   const client = new HelixDB();

   // Query the database
   await client.query(&quot;addUser&quot;, {
     name: &quot;John&quot;,
     age: 20,
   });

   // Get the created user
   const user = await client.query(&quot;getUser&quot;, {
     user_name: &quot;John&quot;,
   });

   console.log(user);
   ```

Other commands:

- `helix instances` to see all your local instances.
- `helix stop &lt;instance-id&gt;` to stop your local instance with specified id.
- `helix stop --all` to stop all your local instances.
- `helix dockerdev run` to start a Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev status` to check the Docker development instance status.
- `helix dockerdev logs` to view Docker container logs.
- `helix dockerdev stop` to stop the Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev delete` to remove the Docker development instance and data.

## Roadmap

Our current focus areas include:

- Organizational auth to manage teams, and Helix clusters.
- Improvements to our server code to massively improve network IO performance and scalability.
- More 3rd party integrations to make it easier to build with Helix.
- Guides and educational content to help you get started with Helix.
- Binary quantisation for even better performance.

Long term projects:

- In-house SOTA knowledge graph ingestion tool for any data source.
- In-house graph-vector storage engine (to replace LMDB)
- In-house network protocol &amp; serdes libraries (similar to protobufs/gRPC)

### Syntax highlighting

`bat` supports syntax highlighting for a large number of programming and markup
languages:

![Syntax highlighting example](https://imgur.com/rGsdnDe.png)

### Git integration

`bat` communicates with `git` to show modifications with respect to the index
(see left side bar):

![Git integration example](https://i.imgur.com/2lSW4RE.png)

### Show non-printable characters

You can use the `-A`/`--show-all` option to show and highlight non-printable
characters:

![Non-printable character example](https://i.imgur.com/WndGp9H.png)

### Automatic paging

By default, `bat` pipes its own output to a pager (e.g. `less`) if the output is too large for one screen.
If you would rather `bat` work like `cat` all the time (never page output), you can set `--paging=never` as an option, either on the command line or in your configuration file.
If you intend to alias `cat` to `bat` in your shell configuration, you can use `alias cat=&#039;bat --paging=never&#039;` to preserve the default behavior.

#### File concatenation

Even with a pager set, you can still use `bat` to concatenate files :wink:.
Whenever `bat` detects a non-interactive terminal (i.e. when you pipe into another process or into a file), `bat` will act as a drop-in replacement for `cat` and fall back to printing the plain file contents, regardless of the `--pager` option&#039;s value.

## How to use

Display a single file on the terminal

```bash
bat README.md
```

Display multiple files at once

```bash
bat src/*.rs
```

Read from stdin, determine the syntax automatically (note, highlighting will
only work if the syntax can be determined from the first line of the file,
usually through a shebang such as `#!/bin/sh`)

```bash
curl -s https://sh.rustup.rs | bat
```

Read from stdin, specify the language explicitly

```bash
yaml2json .travis.yml | json_pp | bat -l json
```

Show and highlight non-printable characters:
```bash
bat -A /etc/hosts
```

Use it as a `cat` replacement:

```bash
bat &gt; note.md  # quickly create a new file

bat header.md content.md footer.md &gt; document.md

bat -n main.rs  # show line numbers (only)

bat f - g  # output &#039;f&#039;, then stdin, then &#039;g&#039;.
```

### Integration with other tools

#### `fzf`

You can use `bat` as a previewer for [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). To do this,
use `bat`&#039;s `--color=always` option to force colorized output. You can also use `--line-range`
option to restrict the load times for long files:

```bash
fzf --preview &quot;bat --color=always --style=numbers --line-range=:500 {}&quot;
```

For more information, see [`fzf`&#039;s `README`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#preview-window).

#### `find` or `fd`

You can use the `-exec` option of `find` to preview all search results with `bat`:

```bash
find … -exec bat {} +
```

If you happen to use [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), you can use the `-X`/`--exec-batch` option to do the same:

```bash
fd … -X bat
```

#### `ripgrep`

With [`batgrep`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batgrep.md), `bat` can be used as the printer for [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) search results.

```bash
batgrep needle src/
```

#### `tail -f`

`bat` can be combined with `tail -f` to continuously monitor a given file with syntax highlighting.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/pacman.log | bat --paging=never -l log
```

Note that we have to switch off paging in order for this to work. We have also specified the syntax
explicitly (`-l log`), as it can not be auto-detected in this case.

#### `git`

You can combine `bat` with `git show` to view an older version of a given file with proper syntax
highlighting:

```bash
git show v0.6.0:src/main.rs | bat -l rs
```

#### `git diff`

You can combine `bat` with `git diff` to view lines around code changes with proper syntax
highlighting:
```bash
batdiff() {
    git diff --name-only --relative --diff-filter=d -z | xargs -0 bat --diff
}
```
If you prefer to use this as a separate tool, check out `batdiff` in [`bat-extras`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras).

If you are looking for more support for git and diff operations, check out [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta).

#### `xclip`

The line numbers and Git modification markers in the output of `bat` can make it hard to copy
the contents of a file. To prevent this, you can call `bat` with the `-p`/`--plain` option or
simply pipe the output into `xclip`:
```bash
bat main.cpp | xclip
```
`bat` will detect that the output is being redirected and print the plain file contents.

#### `man`

`bat` can be used as a colorizing pager for `man`, by setting the
`MANPAGER` environment variable:

```bash
export MANPAGER=&quot;sh -c &#039;awk &#039;\&#039;&#039;{ gsub(/\x1B\[[0-9;]*m/, \&quot;\&quot;, \$0); gsub(/.\x08/, \&quot;\&quot;, \$0); print }&#039;\&#039;&#039; | bat -p -lman&#039;&quot;
man 2 select
```
(replace `bat` with `batcat` if you are on Debian or Ubuntu)

If you prefer to have this bundled in a new command, you can also use [`batman`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batman.md).

&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; This will [not work](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1145) out of the box with Mandoc&#039;s `man` implementation.
&gt;
&gt; Please either use `batman`, or convert the shell script to a [shebang executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) and point `MANPAGER` to that.

Note that the [Manpage syntax](assets/syntaxes/02_Extra/Manpage.sublime-syntax) is developed in this repository and still needs some work.

#### `prettier` / `shfmt` / `rustfmt`

The [`prettybat`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/prettybat.md) script is a wrapper that will format code and print it with `bat`.

#### `Warp`

&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.warp.dev/drive/folder/-Bat-Warp-Pack-lxhe7HrEwgwpG17mvrFSz1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;doc/sponsors/warp-pack-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;Warp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

#### Highlighting `--help` messages

You can use `bat` to colorize help text: `$ cp --help | bat -plhelp`

You can also use a wrapper around this:

```bash
# in your .bashrc/.zshrc/*rc
alias bathelp=&#039;bat --plain --language=help&#039;
help() {
    &quot;$@&quot; --help 2&gt;&amp;1 | bathelp
}
```

Then you can do `$ help cp` or `$ help git commit`.

When you are using `zsh`, you can also use global aliases to override `-h` and `--help` entirely:

```bash
alias -g -- -h=&#039;-h 2&gt;&amp;1 | bat --language=help --style=plain&#039;
alias -g -- --help=&#039;--help 2&gt;&amp;1 | bat --language=help --style=plain&#039;
```

For `fish`, you can use abbreviations:

```fish
abbr -a --position anywhere -- --help &#039;--help | bat -plhelp&#039;
abbr -a --position anywhere -- -h &#039;-h | bat -plhelp&#039;
```

This way, you can keep on using `cp --help`, but get colorized help pages.

Be aware that in some cases, `-h` may not be a shorthand of `--help` (for example with `ls`). In cases where you need to use `-h` 
as a command argument you can prepend `\` to the arguement (eg. `ls \-h`) to escape the aliasing defined above. 

Please report any issues with the help syntax in [this repository](https://github.com/victor-gp/cmd-help-sublime-syntax).


## Installation

&lt;!--

Installation instructions need to:
* be for widely used systems
* be non-obvious
* be from somewhat official sources

--&gt;

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/bat-cat.svg?columns=3&amp;exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/bat-cat/versions)

### On Ubuntu (using `apt`)
*... and other Debian-based Linux distributions.*

```
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The `--path .` above specifies the directory of the source code and NOT where `bat` will be installed.
&gt; For more information see the docs for [`cargo install`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html).

#### From `crates.io`
```bash
cargo install --locked bat
```

Note that additional files like the man page or shell completion
files can not be installed automatically in both these ways.
If installing from a local source, they will be generated by `cargo`
and should be available in the cargo target folder under `build`.

Furthermore, shell completions are also available by running:
```bash
bat --completion &lt;shell&gt;
# see --help for supported shells
```

## Customization

### Highlighting theme

Use `bat --list-themes` to get a list of all available themes for syntax
highlighting. By default, `bat` uses `Monokai Extended` or `Monokai Extended Light`
for dark and light themes respectively. To select the `TwoDark` theme, call `bat`
with the `--theme=TwoDark` option or set the `BAT_THEME` environment variable to
`TwoDark`. Use `export BAT_THEME=&quot;TwoDark&quot;` in your shell&#039;s startup file to
make the change permanent. Alternatively, use `bat`&#039;s
[configuration file](#configuration-file).

If you want to preview the different themes on a custom file, you can use
the following command (you need [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for this):
```bash
bat --list-themes | fzf --preview=&quot;bat --theme={} --color=always /path/to/file&quot;
```

`bat` automatically picks a fitting theme depending on your terminal&#039;s background color.
You can use the `--theme-dark` / `--theme-light` options or the `BAT_THEME_DARK` / `BAT_THEME_LIGHT` environment variables
to customize the themes used. This is especially useful if you frequently switch between dark and light mode.

You can also use a custom theme by following the
[&#039;Adding new themes&#039; section below](#adding-new-themes).

### 8-bit themes

`bat` has three themes that always use [8-bit colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors),
even when truecolor support is available:

- `ansi` looks decent on any terminal. It uses 3-bit colors: black, red, green,
  yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
- `base16` is designed for [base16](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home) terminal themes. It uses
  4-bit colors (3-bit colors plus bright variants) in accordance with the
  [base16 styling guidelines](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home/blob/main/styling.md).
- `base16-256` is designed for [tinted-shell](https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-shell).
  It replaces certain bright colors with 8-bit colors from 16 to 21. **Do not** use this simply
  because you have a 256-color terminal but are not using tinted-shell.

Although these themes are more restricted, they have three advantages over truecolor themes. They:

- Enjoy maximum compatibility. Some terminal utilities do not support more than 3-bit colors.
- Adapt to terminal theme changes. Even for already printed output.
- Visually harmonize better with other terminal software.

### Output style

You can use the `--style` option to control the appearance of `bat`&#039;s output.
You can use `--style=numbers,changes`, for example, to show only Git changes
and line numbers but no grid and no file header. Set the `BAT_STYLE` environment
variable to make these changes permanent or use `bat`&#039;s
[configuration file](#configuration-file).

&gt;[!tip]
&gt; If you specify a default style in `bat`&#039;s config file, you can change which components
&gt; are displayed during a single run of `bat` using the `--style` command-line argument.
&gt; By prefixing a component with `+` or `-`, it can be added or removed from the current style.
&gt;
&gt; For example, if your config contains `--style=full,-snip`, you can run bat with
&gt; `--style=-grid,+snip` to remove the grid and add back the `snip` component.
&gt; Or, if you want to override the styles completely, you use `--style=numbers` to
&gt; only show the line numbers.

### Adding new syntaxes / language definitions

Should you find that a particular syntax is not available within `bat`, you can follow these
instructions to easily add new syntaxes to your current `bat` installation.

`bat` uses the excellent [`syntect`](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/)
library for syntax highlighting. `syntect` can read any
[Sublime Text `.sublime-syntax` file](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html)
and theme.

A good resource for finding Sublime Syntax packages is [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). Once you found a
syntax:

1. Create a folder with syntax definition files:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes&quot;
   cd &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes&quot;

   # Put new &#039;.sublime-syntax&#039; language definition files
   # in this folder (or its subdirectories), for example:
   git clone https://github.com/tellnobody1/sublime-purescript-syntax
   ```

2. Now use the following command to parse these files into a binary cache:

   ```bash
   bat cache --build
   ```

3. Finally, use `bat --list-languages` to check if the new languages are available.

   If you ever want to go back to the default settings, call:

   ```bash
   bat cache --clear
   ```

4. If you think that a specific syntax should be included in `bat` by default, please
   consider opening a &quot;syntax request&quot; ticket after reading the policies and
   instructions [here](doc/assets.md): [Open Syntax Request](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/new?labels=syntax-request&amp;template=syntax_request.md).

### Adding new themes

This works very similar to how we add new syntax definitions.
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Themes are stored in [`.tmTheme` files](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/color_schemes_tmtheme.html).

First, create a folder with the new syntax highlighting themes:
```bash
mkdir -p &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/themes&quot;
cd &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/themes&quot;

# Download a theme in &#039;.tmTheme&#039; format, for example:
git clone https://github.com/greggb/sublime-snazzy

# Update the binary cache
bat cache --build
```

Finally, use `bat --list-themes` to check if the new themes are available.
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; `bat` uses the name of the `.tmTheme` file for the theme&#039;s name. 

### Adding or changing file type associations

You can add new (or change existing) file name patterns using the `--map-syntax`
command line option. The option takes an argument of the form `pattern:syntax` where

## Get an overview of a directory, even a big one

Hit `br -s`

![overview](website/docs/img/20230930-overview.png)

Notice the *unlisted*?

That&#039;s what makes it usable where the old `tree` command would produce pages of output.

`.gitignore` files are properly dealt with to put unwanted files out of your way.

As you sometimes want to see gitignored files, or hidden ones, you&#039;ll soon get used to the &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;i&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;h&lt;/kbd&gt; shortcuts to toggle those visibilities.

(you can ignore them though, see [documentation](https://dystroy.org/broot/navigation/#toggles)).

## Find a directory then `cd` to it

type a few letters

![cd](website/docs/img/20230930-cd.png)

Hit &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt; and you&#039;re back to the terminal in the desired location.

This way, you can navigate to a directory with the minimum amount of keystrokes, even if you don&#039;t exactly remember where it is.

Broot is fast and doesn&#039;t block (any keystroke interrupts the current search to start the next one).

Most useful keys for this:

* the letters of what you&#039;re looking for
* &lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt; on the root line to go up to the parent (staying in broot)
* &lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt; to focus a directory (staying in broot)
* &lt;kbd&gt;esc&lt;/kbd&gt; to get back to the previous state or clear your search
* &lt;kbd class=b&gt;↓&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd class=b&gt;↑&lt;/kbd&gt; may be used to move the selection
* &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt; to get back to the shell having `cd` to the selected directory
* &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;h&lt;/kbd&gt; to toggle showing hidden files (the ones whose name starts with a dot)
* &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;i&lt;/kbd&gt; to toggle showing gitignored files
* `:q` if you just want to quit (you can use &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;q&lt;/kbd&gt; if you prefer)

## Never lose track of file hierarchy while you search

![search](website/docs/img/20230930-gccran.png)

Broot tries to select the most relevant file. You can still go from one match to another one using &lt;kbd&gt;tab&lt;/kbd&gt; or arrow keys.

You may also search with a regular expression. To do this, add a `/` before the pattern.

And you have [other types of searches](input/#the-filtering-pattern), for example searching on file content (start with `c/`):

![content search](website/docs/img/20230930-content-memm.png)

You may also apply logical operators or combine patterns, for example searching `test` in all files except json ones could be `!/json$/&amp;c/test` and searching `carg` both in file names and file contents would be `carg|c/carg`.

Once the file you want is selected you can

* hit &lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt; (or double-click) to open it in your system&#039;s default program
* hit &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt; to open it in your system&#039;s default program and close broot
* hit &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;→&lt;/kbd&gt; to preview it (and then a second time to go inside the preview)
* type a verb. For example `:e` opens the file in your preferred editor (which may be a terminal one)

[blog: a broot content search workflow](https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-c-search/)

## Manipulate your files

Most often, when not using broot, you move your files in the blind. You do a few `ls` before, then your manipulation, and maybe you check after.

You can instead do it without losing the view of the file hierarchy.

![mv](website/docs/img/20230930-mv.png)

Move, copy, rm, mkdir, are built in and you can add your own shortcuts.

Here&#039;s chmod:

![chmod](website/docs/img/20230930-chmod.png)

## Manage files with panels

When a directory is selected, do &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;→&lt;/kbd&gt; and you open another panel (you may open other ones, or navigate between them, with &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;←&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;→&lt;/kbd&gt;).

![custom colors tree](website/docs/img/20230930-colored-panels.png)

(yes, colors are fully customizable)

You can for example copy or move elements between panels:

![cpp](website/docs/img/20230930-cpp.png)

If you like you may do it Norton Commander style by binding `:copy_to_panel` to &lt;kbd&gt;F5&lt;/kbd&gt; and `:move_to_panel` to &lt;kbd&gt;F6&lt;/kbd&gt;.

## Preview files

Hit &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;→&lt;/kbd&gt; when a file is selected and the preview panel appears.

![preview](website/docs/img/20230930-preview.png)

![preview](website/docs/img/20230930-preview-image.png)

The preview panel stays synchronized with the selection in tree panels.

Broot displays images in high resolution when the terminal supports Kitty&#039;s graphics protocol
(compatible terminals: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html), [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)):

![kitty preview](website/docs/img/20201127-kitty-preview.png)

## Apply a standard or personal command to a file

![size](website/docs/img/20230930-edit.png)

Just find the file you want to edit with a few keystrokes, type `:e`, then &lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt;.

You can add verbs or configure the existing ones; see [documentation](https://dystroy.org/broot/conf_file/#verbs-shortcuts-and-keys).

And you can add shortcuts, for example a &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; sequence or a function key

## Apply commands on several files

Add files to the [staging area](staging-area) then execute any command on all of them.

![staging mv](website/docs/img/20230930-staging-mv.png)

## Replace `ls` (and its clones):

If you want to display *sizes*, *dates* and *permissions*, do `br -sdp` which gets you this:

![replace ls](website/docs/img/20240501-sdp.png)

You may also toggle options with a few keystrokes while inside broot.
For example you could have typed this `-sdp` while in broot.
Or hit &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;h&lt;/kbd&gt; and you see hidden files.

## Sort, see what takes space:

You may sort by launching broot with `--sort-by-size` or `--sort-by-date`. Or you may, inside broot, type a space, then `sd`, and &lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt; and you toggled the `:sort_by_date` mode.

When sorting, the whole content of directories is taken into account. So if you want to find on Monday morning the most recently modified files, launch `br --sort-by-date ~`.

If you start broot with the `--whale-spotting` option (or its shortcut `-w`), you get a mode tailored to &quot;whale spotting&quot; navigation, making it easy to determine what files or folders take space.

Sizes, dates, files counts, are computed in the background, you don&#039;t have to wait for them when you navigate.

![size](website/docs/img/20230930-whale-spotting.png)

And you keep all broot tools, like filtering or the ability to delete or open files and directories.

If you hit `:fs`, you can check the usage of all filesystems, so that you focus on cleaning the full ones.

![fs](website/docs/img/20230930-fs.png)


## Check git statuses:

Use `:gf` to display the statuses of files (what are the new ones, the modified ones, etc.), the current branch name and the change statistics.

![size](website/docs/img/20230930-git.png)

And if you want to see *only* the files which would be displayed by the `git status` command, do `:gs`. From there it&#039;s easy to edit, or diff, selected files.

![gg](website/docs/img/20230930-gg.png)

From there it&#039;s easy to edit, diff,  or revert selected files.

[blog: use broot and meld to diff before commit](https://dystroy.org/blog/gg/)

## Overview

AI coding agents are increasingly writing the world&#039;s code and human engineers now spend the majority of their time planning, reviewing, and orchestrating tasks. Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:

- Easily switch between different coding agents
- Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence
- Quickly review work and start dev servers
- Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on
- Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs

You can watch a video overview [here](https://youtu.be/TFT3KnZOOAk).

## Installation

Make sure you have authenticated with your favourite coding agent. A full list of supported coding agents can be found in the [docs](https://vibekanban.com/docs). Then in your terminal run:

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

## Documentation

Please head to the [website](https://vibekanban.com/docs) for the latest documentation and user guides.

## Support

Please open an issue on this repo if you find any bugs or have any feature requests.

## Contributing

We would prefer that ideas and changes are raised with the core team via GitHub issues, where we can discuss implementation details and alignment with the existing roadmap. Please do not open PRs without first discussing your proposal with the team.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (&gt;=18)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (&gt;=8)

Additional development tools:
```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Running the dev server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the frontend and backend with live reloading. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.

### Build from source

1. Run `build-npm-package.sh`
2. In the `npx-cli` folder run `npm pack`
3. You can run your build with `npx [GENERATED FILE].tgz`


### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | Build-time | `Ov23li9bxz3kKfPOIsGm` | GitHub OAuth app client ID for authentication |
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |
| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend development server port |
| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |
| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_ORPHAN_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable git worktree cleanup (for debugging) |

**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.

#### Custom GitHub OAuth App (Optional)

By default, Vibe Kanban uses Bloop AI&#039;s GitHub OAuth app for authentication. To use your own GitHub app for self-hosting or custom branding:

1. Create a GitHub OAuth App at [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Enable &quot;Device Flow&quot; in the app settings
3. Set scopes to include `user:email,repo`
4. Build with your client ID:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here pnpm run build
   ```

rust-analyzer is a language server that provides IDE functionality for
writing Rust programs. You can use it with any editor that supports
the [Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (VS
Code, Vim, Emacs, Zed, etc).

rust-analyzer features include go-to-definition, find-all-references,
refactorings and code completion. rust-analyzer also supports
integrated formatting (with rustfmt) and integrated diagnostics (with
rustc and clippy).

Internally, rust-analyzer is structured as a set of libraries for
analyzing Rust code. See
[Architecture](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/book/contributing/architecture.html)

`gitoxide` is an implementation of `git` written in Rust for developing future-proof applications which strive for correctness and
performance while providing a pleasant and unsurprising developer experience.

There are two primary ways to use `gitoxide`:

1. **As Rust library**: Use the [`gix`](https://docs.rs/gix) crate as a Cargo dependency for API access.
1. **As command-line tool**: The `gix` binary as development tool to help testing the API in real repositories,
    and the `ein` binary with workflow-enhancing tools. Both binaries may forever be unstable,
    *do not rely on them in scripts*.

[`gix`]: https://docs.rs/gix

## Development Status

The command-line tools as well as the status of each crate is described in
[the crate status document](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md).

For use in applications, look for the [`gix`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md#gix) crate,
which serves as entrypoint to the functionality provided by various lower-level plumbing crates like
[`gix-config`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md#gix-config).

### Feature Discovery

&gt; Can `gix` do what I need it to do?

The above can be hard to answer and this paragraph is here to help with feature discovery.

Look at [`crate-status.md`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md) for a rather exhaustive document that contains
both implemented and planned features.

Further, the [`gix` crate documentation with the `git2` search term](https://docs.rs/gix/latest/gix?search=git2) helps to find all currently
known `git2` equivalent method calls. Please note that this list is definitely not exhaustive yet, but might help if you are coming from `git2`.

What follows is a high-level list of features and those which are planned:

* [x] clone
* [x] fetch
* [ ] push
* [x] blame (*plumbing*)
* [x] status
* [x] blob and tree-diff
* [ ] merge
    - [x] blobs
    - [x] trees
    - [ ] commits
* [x] commit
    - [ ] hooks
* [x] commit-graph traversal
* [ ] rebase
* [x] worktree checkout and worktree stream
* [ ] reset
* [x] reading and writing of objects
* [x] reading and writing of refs
* [x] reading and writing of `.git/index`
* [x] reading and writing of git configuration
* [x] pathspecs
* [x] revspecs
* [x] `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`

### Crates

Follow linked crate name for detailed status. Please note that all crates follow [semver] as well as the [stability guide].

[semver]: https://semver.org

### Production Grade

* **Stability Tier 1**
  - [gix-lock](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/gix-lock/README.md)

### Stability and MSRV

Our [stability guide] helps to judge how much churn can be expected when depending on crates in this workspace.

[stability guide]: https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/STABILITY.md

## Installation

### Download a Binary Release

Using `cargo binstall`, one is able to fetch [binary releases][releases]. You can install it via `cargo install cargo-binstall`, assuming
the [rust toolchain][rustup] is present.

Then install gitoxide with `cargo binstall gitoxide`.

See the [releases section][releases] for manual installation and various alternative builds that are _slimmer_ or _smaller_, depending
on your needs, for _Linux_, _MacOS_ and _Windows_.

[releases]: https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/releases

### Download from Arch Linux repository

For Arch Linux you can download `gitoxide` from `community` repository:

```sh
pacman -S gitoxide
```

### Download from Exherbo Linux Rust repository

For Exherbo Linux you can download `gitoxide` from the [Rust](https://gitlab.exherbo.org/exherbo/rust/-/tree/master/packages/dev-scm/gitoxide) repository:

```sh
cave resolve -x repository/rust
cave resolve -x gitoxide
```

### From Source via Cargo

`cargo` is the Rust package manager which can easily be obtained through [rustup]. With it, you can build your own binary
effortlessly and for your particular CPU for additional performance gains.

The minimum supported Rust version is [documented in the CI configuration](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/.github/workflows/msrv.yml#L23),
the latest stable one will work as well.

There are various build configurations, all of them are [documented here](https://docs.rs/crate/gitoxide/latest). The documentation should also be useful
for packagers who need to tune external dependencies.

```sh
# A way to install `gitoxide` with just Rust and a C compiler installed.
# If there are problems with SSL certificates during clones, try to omit `--locked`.
cargo install gitoxide --locked --no-default-features --features max-pure

# The default installation, &#039;max&#039;, is the fastest, but also needs `cmake` to build successfully.
# Installing it is platform-dependent.
cargo install gitoxide

# For smaller binaries and even faster build times that are traded for a less fancy CLI implementation,
# use the `lean` feature.
cargo install gitoxide --locked --no-default-features --features lean
```

The following installs the latest unpublished `max` release directly from git:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide gitoxide
```

#### How to deal with build failures

On some platforms, installation may fail due to lack of tools required by *C* toolchains. This can generally be avoided by installation with:

```sh
cargo install gitoxide --no-default-features --features max-pure
```

What follows is a list of known failures.

- On Fedora, `perl` needs to be installed for `OpenSSL` to build properly. This can be done with the following command (see [issue #592](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/issues/592)):

  ```sh
  dnf install perl
  ```

### Using Docker

Some CI/CD pipelines leverage repository cloning. Below is a copy-paste-able example to build docker images for such workflows.
As no official image exists (at this time), an image must first be built.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The dockerfile isn&#039;t continuously tested as it costs too much time and thus might already be broken.
&gt; PRs are welcome.

#### Building the most compatible base image

```sh
docker build -f etc/docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t gitoxide:latest --compress . --target=pipeline
```

#### Basic usage in a Pipeline

For example, if a `Dockerfile` currently uses something like `RUN git clone https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide`, first build the image:

```sh
docker build -f etc/docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t gitoxide:latest --compress .
```

Then copy the binaries into your image and replace the `git` directive with a `gix` equivalent.

```dockerfile
COPY --from gitoxide:latest /bin/gix /usr/local/bin/
COPY --from gitoxide:latest /bin/ein /usr/local/bin/

RUN /usr/local/bin/gix clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide gitoxide
```

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs

## Usage

Once installed, there are two binaries:

* **ein**
  * high level commands, _porcelain_, for every-day use, optimized for a pleasant user experience
* **gix**
  * low level commands, _plumbing_, for use in more specialized cases and to validate newly written code in real-world scenarios

## Project Goals

Project goals can change over time as we learn more, and they can be challenged.

 * **a pure-rust implementation of git**
   * including *transport*, *object database*, *references*, *cli* and *tui*
   * a simple command-line interface is provided for the most common git operations, optimized for
     user experience. A *simple-git* if you so will.
   * be the go-to implementation for anyone who wants to solve problems around git, and become
     *the* alternative to `GitPython` and *libgit2* in the process.
   * become the foundation for a distributed alternative to GitHub, and maybe even for use within GitHub itself
 * **learn from the best to write the best possible idiomatic Rust**
   * *libgit2* is a fantastic resource to see what abstractions work, we will use them
   * use Rust&#039;s type system to make misuse impossible
 * **be the best performing implementation**
   * use Rust&#039;s type system to optimize for work not done without being hard to use
   * make use of parallelism from the get go
   * _sparse checkout_ support from day one
 * **assure on-disk consistency**
   * assure reads never interfere with concurrent writes
   * assure multiple concurrent writes don&#039;t cause trouble
 * **take shortcuts, but not in quality**
   * binaries may use `anyhow::Error` exhaustively, knowing these errors are solely user-facing.
   * libraries use light-weight custom errors implemented using `quick-error` or `thiserror`.
   * internationalization is nothing we are concerned with right now.
   * IO errors due to insufficient amount of open file handles don&#039;t always lead to operation failure
 * **Cross platform support, including Windows**
   * With the tools and experience available here there is no reason not to support Windows.
   * [Windows is tested on CI](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/df66d74aa2a8cb62d8a03383135f08c8e8c579a8/.github/workflows/rust.yml#L34)
     and failures do prevent releases.

## Non-Goals

Project non-goals can change over time as we learn more, and they can be challenged.

 * **replicate `git` command functionality perfectly**
   * `git` is `git`, and there is no reason to not use it. Our path is the one of simplicity to make
     getting started with git easy.
 * **be incompatible to git**
   * the on-disk format must remain compatible, and we will never contend with it.
 * **use async IO everywhere**
   * for the most part, git operations are heavily reliant on memory mapped IO as well as CPU to decompress data,
     which doesn&#039;t lend itself well to async IO out of the box.
   * Use `blocking` as well as `gix-features::interrupt` to bring operations into the async world and to control
     long running operations.
   * When connecting or streaming over TCP connections, especially when receiving on the server, async seems like a must
     though, but behind a feature flag.

## Contributions

## Roadmap

### Features for 1.0

Provide a CLI to for the most basic user journey:

* [x] initialize a repository
* [x] fetch
    * [ ] and update worktree
* clone a repository
   - [ ] bare
   - [ ] with working tree
* [ ] create a commit after adding worktree files
* [x] add a remote
* [ ] push
  * [x] create (thin) pack

### Ideas for Examples

* [ ] `gix tool open-remote` open the URL of the remote, possibly after applying known transformations to go from `ssh` to `https`.
* [ ] `tix` as example implementation of `tig`, displaying a version of the commit graph, useful for practicing how highly responsive GUIs can be made.
* [ ] Something like [`git-sizer`](https://github.com/github/git-sizer), but leveraging extreme decompression speeds of indexed packs.
* [ ] Open up SQL for git using [sqlite virtual tables](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/blob/master/tests/vtab.rs). Check out gitqlite
  as well. What would an MVP look like? Maybe even something that could ship with git

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

## What is it?

- Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html).
- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## Demo

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

[![demo](./docs/tapes/demo.gif)](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

See [demo transcript](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html).

## Quickstart

### Install mise

See [Getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for more options.

```sh-session
$ curl https://mise.run | sh
$ ~/.local/bin/mise --version
2025.9.15 macos-arm64 (a1b2d3e 2025-09-21)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@22 -- node -v
mise node@22.x.x ✓ installed
v22.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@22 go@1
$ node -v
v22.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

&lt;/picture&gt;

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.
