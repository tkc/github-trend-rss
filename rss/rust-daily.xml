**Burn is a next generation Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on &lt;br /&gt;
flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

## Performance

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-blazingly-fast.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Because we believe the goal of a deep learning framework is to convert computation into useful
intelligence, we have made performance a core pillar of Burn. We strive to achieve top efficiency by
leveraging multiple optimization techniques described below.

**Click on each section for more details** üëá

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel fusion üí•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Using Burn means having your models optimized on any backend. When possible, we provide a way to
automatically and dynamically create custom kernels that minimize data relocation between different
memory spaces, extremely useful when moving memory is the bottleneck.

As an example, you could write your own GELU activation function with the high level tensor api (see
Rust code snippet below).

```rust
fn gelu_custom&lt;B: Backend, const D: usize&gt;(x: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
    let x = x.clone() * ((x / SQRT_2).erf() + 1);
    x / 2
}
```

Then, at runtime, a custom low-level kernel will be automatically created for your specific
implementation and will rival a handcrafted GPU implementation. The kernel consists of about 60
lines of WGSL [WebGPU Shading Language](&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/&quot;),
an extremely verbose lower level shader language you probably don&#039;t want to program your deep
learning models in!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Asynchronous execution ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

For [first-party backends](#backends), an asynchronous execution style
is used, which allows to perform various optimizations, such as the previously mentioned automatic
kernel fusion.

Asynchronous execution also ensures that the normal execution of the framework does not block the
model computations, which implies that the framework overhead won&#039;t impact the speed of execution
significantly. Conversely, the intense computations in the model do not interfere with the
responsiveness of the framework. For more information about our asynchronous backends, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Thread-safe building blocks ü¶û
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn emphasizes thread safety by leveraging the
[ownership system of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
With Burn, each module is the owner of its weights. It is therefore possible to send a module to
another thread for computing the gradients, then send the gradients to the main thread that can
aggregate them, and _voil√†_, you get multi-device training.

This is a very different approach from what PyTorch does, where backpropagation actually mutates the
_grad_ attribute of each tensor parameter. This is not a thread-safe operation and therefore
requires lower level synchronization primitives, see
[distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) for reference. Note that
this is still very fast, but not compatible across different backends and quite hard to implement.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Intelligent memory management ü¶Ä
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

One of the main roles of a deep learning framework is to reduce the amount of memory necessary to
run models. The naive way of handling memory is that each tensor has its own memory space, which is
allocated when the tensor is created then deallocated as the tensor gets out of scope. However,
allocating and deallocating data is very costly, so a memory pool is often required to achieve good
throughput. Burn offers an infrastructure that allows for easily creating and selecting memory
management strategies for backends. For more details on memory management in Burn, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

Another very important memory optimization of Burn is that we keep track of when a tensor can be
mutated in-place just by using the ownership system well. Even though it is a rather small memory
optimization on its own, it adds up considerably when training or running inference with larger
models and contributes to reduce the memory usage even more. For more information, see
[this blog post about tensor handling](https://burn.dev/blog/burn-rusty-approach-to-tensor-handling).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel selection üéØ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A good deep learning framework should ensure that models run smoothly on all hardware. However, not
all hardware share the same behavior in terms of execution speed. For instance, a matrix
multiplication kernel can be launched with many different parameters, which are highly sensitive to
the size of the matrices and the hardware. Using the wrong configuration could reduce the speed of
execution by a large factor (10 times or even more in extreme cases), so choosing the right kernels
becomes a priority.

With our home-made backends, we run benchmarks automatically and choose the best configuration for
the current hardware and matrix sizes with a reasonable caching strategy.

This adds a small overhead by increasing the warmup execution time, but stabilizes quickly after a
few forward and backward passes, saving lots of time in the long run. Note that this feature isn&#039;t
mandatory, and can be disabled when cold starts are a priority over optimized throughput.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Hardware specific features üî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is no secret that deep learning is mostly relying on matrix multiplication as its core operation,
since this is how fully-connected neural networks are modeled.

More and more, hardware manufacturers optimize their chips specifically for matrix multiplication
workloads. For instance, Nvidia has its _Tensor Cores_ and today most cellphones have AI specialized
chips. As of this moment, we support Tensor Cores with our LibTorch, Candle, CUDA, Metal and WGPU/SPIR-V
backends, but not other accelerators yet. We hope
[this issue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4195) gets resolved at some point to bring
support to our WGPU backend.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Custom Backend Extension üéí
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn aims to be the most flexible deep learning framework. While it&#039;s crucial to maintain
compatibility with a wide variety of backends, Burn also provides the ability to extend the
functionalities of a backend implementation to suit your personal modeling requirements.

This versatility is advantageous in numerous ways, such as supporting custom operations like flash
attention or manually writing your own kernel for a specific backend to enhance performance. See
[this section](https://burn.dev/burn-book/advanced/backend-extension/index.html) in the Burn Book üî•
for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;


Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust implementations.
We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your models in the cloud,
then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Supported Backends**

| Backend  | Devices                      | Class       |
| -------  | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| CUDA     | NVIDIA GPUs                  | First-Party |
| ROCm     | AMD GPUs                     | First-Party |
| Metal    | Apple GPUs                   | First-Party |
| Vulkan   | Most GPUs on Linux &amp; Windows | First-Party |
| Wgpu     | Most GPUs                    | First-Party |
| NdArray  | Most CPUs                    | Third-Party |
| LibTorch | Most GPUs &amp; CPUs             | Third-Party |
| Candle   | Nvidia, Apple GPUs &amp; CPUs    | Third-Party |

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend üîÑ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
For now, only the WGPU and CUDA backends have support for fused kernels.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Fusion, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Fusion&lt;Wgpu&gt;&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}

```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server.
The client sends tensor operations over the network to a remote compute backend.
You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand üëá**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard üìà
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption üõ°

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support üê´
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-standard format that exports both the architecture
and the weights of a deep learning model.

Burn supports the importation of models that follow the ONNX standard so you can easily port a model
you have written in another framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn to benefit from all the
advantages our framework offers.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch Models üöö
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Support for loading of PyTorch model weights into Burn‚Äôs native model architecture, ensuring
seamless integration. See
[Burn Book üî• section on importing PyTorch](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/pytorch-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser üåê
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can compile to Web Assembly: Candle and NdArray for CPU, and WGPU for GPU.
This means that you can run inference directly within a browser. We provide several examples of
this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2Ô∏è‚É£ 7Ô∏è‚É£ üò∞
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! üåÑ

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ‚öôÔ∏è
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).


&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**  
&gt; When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency chain.  
&gt; To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file:
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.


## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-walking.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book üî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/burn-book/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests üòÑ

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples üôè
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

We have a somewhat large amount of [examples](./examples) in the repository that shows how to use
the framework in diffe

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use‚Äîwhether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models‚Äîlike [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]‚Äîwith a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes‚Äîwhich is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any
questions, or want to talk about future plans, please join us on Discord
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/968932220549103686.svg?label=&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=ffffff&amp;color=7389D8&amp;labelColor=6A7EC2)](https://discord.gg/dkmfj3aGQN),
start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) C library and the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [&quot;co-located&quot; local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary&#039;s name may change (i.e.
away from `jj`). For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful
as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you
need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience,
consider signing up to our [collaborative online editor][app] for free.

## Example
A [gentle introduction][tutorial] to Typst is available in our documentation.
However, if you want to see the power of Typst encapsulated in one image, here
it is:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 &lt;img alt=&quot;Example&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


Let&#039;s dissect what&#039;s going on:

- We use _set rules_ to configure element properties like the size of pages or
  the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to `auto`, it scales to
  fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you
  need full control, you can also use [show rules][show] to completely redefine
  the appearance of an element.

- We insert a heading with the `= Heading` syntax. One equals sign creates a top
  level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight
  markup like this, see the [syntax] reference for a full list.

- [Mathematical equations][math] are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra
  spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block.
  Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions
  unless put into quotes. This way, we don&#039;t need backslashes for things like
  `floor` and `sqrt`. And `phi.alt` applies the `alt` modifier to the `phi` to
  select a particular symbol variant.

- Now, we get to some [scripting]. To input code into a Typst document, we can
  write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a
  recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the
  results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells
  row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas `$F_1$` to `$F_8$` and then
  the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator (`..`) to both
  because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays&#039; items as individual
  arguments.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Text version of the code example.&lt;/summary&gt;

  ```typst
  #set page(width: 10cm, height: auto)
  #set heading(numbering: &quot;1.&quot;)

  = Fibonacci sequence
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined through the
  recurrence relation $F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)$.
  It can also be expressed in _closed form:_

  $ F_n = round(1 / sqrt(5) phi.alt^n), quad
    phi.alt = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 $

  #let count = 8
  #let nums = range(1, count + 1)
  #let fib(n) = (
    if n &lt;= 2 { 1 }
    else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
  )

  The first #count numbers of the sequence are:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: count,
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; $F_#n$),
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; str(fib(n))),
  ))
  ```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation
Typst&#039;s CLI is available from different sources:

- You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst
  from the [releases page][releases]. Download the archive for your platform and
  place it in a directory that is in your `PATH`. To stay up to date with future
  releases, you can simply run `typst update`.

- You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the
  versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release.
  - Linux:
      - View [Typst on Repology][repology]
      - View [Typst&#039;s Snap][snap]
  - macOS: `brew install typst`
  - Windows: `winget install --id Typst.Typst`

- If you have a [Rust][rust] toolchain installed, you can install
  - the latest released Typst version with
    `cargo install --locked typst-cli`
  - a development version with
    `cargo install --git https://github.com/typst/typst --locked typst-cli`

- Nix users can
  - use the `typst` package with `nix-shell -p typst`
  - build and run a development version with
    `nix run github:typst/typst -- --version`.

- Docker users can run a prebuilt image with
  `docker run ghcr.io/typst/typst:latest --help`.

## Usage
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `file.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile file.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile path/to/source.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch file.typ
```

Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all
of the fonts it discovered:
```sh
# Adds additional directories to search for fonts.
typst compile --font-path path/to/fonts file.typ

# Lists all of the discovered fonts in the system and the given directory.
typst fonts --font-path path/to/fonts

# Or via environment variable (Linux syntax).
TYPST_FONT_PATHS=path/to/fonts typst fonts
```

For other CLI subcommands and options, see below:
```sh
# Prints available subcommands and options.
typst help

# Prints detailed usage of a subcommand.
typst help watch
```

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant
preview, you can also check out [Typst&#039;s free web app][app].

## Community
The main places where the community gathers are our [Forum][forum] and our
[Discord server][discord]. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help
others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more
suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat.
We&#039;d be happy to see you there!

[Typst Universe][universe] is where the community shares templates and packages.
If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our
[package repository][packages].

If you had a bad experience in our community, please [reach out to us][contact].

## Contributing
We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel
free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix,
please follow the steps outlined in the [contribution guide][contributing].

To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the
[latest stable Rust][rust] installed. Then, clone this repository and build the
CLI with the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typst/typst
cd typst
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be stored in `target/release/`.

Another good way to contribute is by [sharing packages][packages] with the
community.

## Pronunciation and Spelling
IPA: /ta…™pst/. &quot;Ty&quot; like in **Ty**pesetting and &quot;pst&quot; like in Hi**pst**er. When
writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital &quot;T&quot;.

## Design Principles
All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power,
simplicity, and performance. We think it&#039;s time for a system that matches the
power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize
instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles:

- **Simplicity through Consistency:**
  If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that
  knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing,
  one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g.
  it&#039;s okay that `= Introduction` and `#heading[Introduction]` do the same thing
  because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter.

- **Power through Composability:**
  There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or
  have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the
  second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we&#039;ve
  never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it&#039;s a bit
  low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don&#039;t really
  have that much composability. Instead, there&#039;s a package for everything
  (`\usepackage{knob}`).

- **Performance through Incrementality:**
  All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation.
  Luckily we have [`comemo`], a system for incremental compilation which does
  most of the hard work in the background.

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.


&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and Gnu Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,

# Time-aware multimodal data stack and visualizations
Rerun is building the multimodal data stack to model, ingest, store, query and view robotics-style data.
It&#039;s used in areas like robotics, spatial and embodied AI, generative media, industrial processing, simulation, security, and health.

Rerun is easy to use!
Use the Rerun SDK (available for C++, Python and Rust) to log data like images, tensors, point clouds, and text.
Logs are streamed to the Rerun Viewer for live visualization or to file for later use.
You can also query the logged data through [our dataframe API](https://rerun.io/docs/howto/dataframe-api).

[Get started](#getting-started) in minutes ‚Äì no account needed.

* [Run the Rerun Viewer in your browser](https://www.rerun.io/viewer)
* [Read about what Rerun is and who it is for](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-rerun)

### A short taste
```py
import rerun as rr  # pip install rerun-sdk

rr.init(&quot;rerun_example_app&quot;)

rr.connect()  # Connect to a remote viewer
# rr.spawn()  # Spawn a child process with a viewer and connect
# rr.save(&quot;recording.rrd&quot;)  # Stream all logs to disk

# Associate subsequent data with 42 on the ‚Äúframe‚Äù timeline
rr.set_time(&quot;frame&quot;, sequence=42)

# Log colored 3D points to the entity at `path/to/points`
rr.log(&quot;path/to/points&quot;, rr.Points3D(positions, colors=colors))
‚Ä¶

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting started
* [**C++**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/cpp)
* [**Python**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/python): `pip install rerun-sdk` or on [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/rerun-sdk-feedstock)
* [**Rust**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/rust): `cargo add rerun`

### Installing the Rerun Viewer binary
To stream log data over the network or load our `.rrd` data files you also need the `rerun` binary.
It can be installed with `pip install rerun-sdk` or with `cargo install rerun-cli --locked --features nasm` (see note below).
Note that only the Python SDK comes bundled with the Viewer whereas C++ &amp; Rust always rely on a separate install.

**Note**: the `nasm` Cargo feature requires the [`nasm`](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) CLI to be installed and available in your path.
Alternatively, you may skip enabling this feature, but this may result in inferior video decoding performance.

You should now be able to run `rerun --help` in any terminal.

## Status
We are in active development.
There are many features we want to add, and the API is still evolving.
_Expect breaking changes!_

Some shortcomings:
* [The viewer slows down when there are too many entities](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/7115)
* [We don&#039;t support transparency yet](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1611)
* The data you want to visualize must fit in RAM
  - See &lt;https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/limit-ram&gt; for how to bound memory use.
  - We plan on having a disk-based data store some time in the future.

## What is Rerun for?

Rerun is built to help you understand and improve complex processes that include rich multimodal data, like 2D, 3D, text, time series, tensors, etc.
It is used in many industries, including robotics, simulation, computer vision,
or anything that involves a lot of sensors or other signals that evolve over time.

### Example use case
Say you&#039;re building a vacuum cleaning robot and it keeps running into walls. Why is it doing that? You need some tool to debug it, but a normal debugger isn&#039;t gonna be helpful. Similarly, just logging text won&#039;t be very helpful either. The robot may log &quot;Going through doorway&quot; but that won&#039;t explain why it thinks the wall is a door.

What you need is a visual and temporal debugger, that can log all the different representations of the world the robots holds in its little head, such as:

* RGB camera feed
* depth images
* lidar scan
* segmentation image (how the robot interprets what it sees)
* its 3D map of the apartment
* all the objects the robot has detected (or thinks it has detected), as 3D shapes in the 3D map
* its confidence in its prediction
* etc

You also want to see how all these streams of data evolve over time so you can go back and pinpoint exactly what went wrong, when and why.

Maybe it turns out that a glare from the sun hit one of the sensors in the wrong way, confusing the segmentation network leading to bad object detection. Or maybe it was a bug in the lidar scanning code. Or maybe the robot thought it was somewhere else in the apartment, because its odometry was broken. Or it could be one of a thousand other things. Rerun will help you find out!

But seeing the world from the point of the view of the robot is not just for debugging - it will also give you ideas on how to improve the algorithms, new test cases to set up, or datasets to collect. It will also let you explain the brains of the robot to your colleagues, boss, and customers. And so on. Seeing is believing, and an image is worth a thousand words, and multimodal temporal logging is worth a thousand images :)

While seeing and understanding your data is core to making progress in robotics, there is one more thing:
You can also use the data you collected for visualization to create new datasets for training and evaluating the models and algorithms that run on your robot.
Rerun provides query APIs to make it easy to extract clean datasets from your recording for exactly that purpose.

Of course, Rerun is useful for much more than just robots. Any time you have any form of sensors, or 2D or 3D state evolving over time, Rerun is a great tool.


## Business model
Rerun uses an open-core model. Everything in this repository will stay open source and free (both as in beer and as in freedom).

We are also building a commercial data platform.
Right now that is only available for a few select design partners.
[Click here if you&#039;re interested](https://rerun.io/pricing).

The Rerun open source project targets the needs of individual developers.
The commercial product targets the needs specific to teams that build and run computer vision and robotics products.

## How to cite Rerun

When using Rerun in your research, please cite it to acknowledge its contribution to your work. This can be done by

## Features and Roadmap

Limbo is a _work-in-progress_, in-process OLTP database engine library written in Rust that has:

* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **SQLite compatibility** [[doc](COMPAT.md)] for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API
* **Language bindings** for JavaScript/WebAssembly, Rust, Go, Python, and [Java](bindings/java)
* **OS support** for Linux, macOS, and Windows

In the future, we will be also working on:

* **Integrated vector search** for embeddings and vector similarity.
* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput.
* **Improved schema management** including better `ALTER` support and strict column types by default.

## Getting Started

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üíª Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `limbo` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/releases/latest/download/limbo_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the shell to execute SQL statements:

```console
Limbo
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
limbo&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT);
limbo&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
limbo&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
limbo&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;ü¶Ä Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add limbo
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;‚ú® JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i limbo-wasm
```

Example usage:

```js
import { Database } from &#039;limbo-wasm&#039;;

const db = new Database(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üêç Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
pip install pylimbo
```

Example usage:

```python
import limbo

con = limbo.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üêπ Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the library and set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include limbo&#039;s target directory
```console
cargo build --package limbo-go
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/limbo/target/debug:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
3. Use the driver

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
go install github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _&quot;github.com/tursodatabase/limbo&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;sqlite3&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;‚òïÔ∏è Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Limbo into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Limbo with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

## FAQ

### How is Limbo different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Limbo is a project to build the modern evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Limbo is not - although it is evolving rapidly. As the project starts to near production readiness, we plan to rename it to just &quot;Turso&quot;. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile

cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you are running these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, otherwise the application might not be able to find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

  [![An animated visual of fluvio distributed streaming runtime](.github/assets/infinyon-fluvio-sdf.gif)](https://fluvio.io)

  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Fluvio** is a lean and mean distributed data streaming engine written in Rust. Combined with **Stateful DataFlow** distributed stream processing framework, Fluvio provides a *unified* *composable* *distributed streaming* and *stream processin*g paradigm for developers. It is the foundation of [InfinyOn Cloud](https://infinyon.cloud/).

## Quick Start - Get started with Fluvio and Stateful DataFlow in 5 minutes or less on your system!

### Step 1. Download Fluvio Version Manager:

Fluvio is installed via the **Fluvio Version Manager**, shortened to `fvm`.

To install `fvm`, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```
As part of the initial setup, `fvm` will also install the Fluvio CLI available in the stable channel as of the moment of installation.

Fluvio is stored in `$HOME/.fluvio`, with the executable binaries stored in `$HOME/.fluvio/bin`.

&gt; For the best compatibliity on Windows, InfinyOn recommends WSL2

### Step 2. Start a cluster:

Start cluster on you local machine with the following command:

```bash
fluvio cluster start
```

### Step 3. Install SDF CLI

Stateful dataflows are managed via `sdf cli` that we install it using `fvm`.

```bash
fvm install sdf-beta9
```

### Step 4. Create the Dataflow file

Create a dataflow file in the directory `split-sentence` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p split-sentence-inline
cd split-sentence-inline
```

Create the `dataflow.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: 0.5.0

meta:
  name: split-sentence-inline
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: example

config:
  converter: raw

topics:
  sentence:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw
  words:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw

services:
  sentence-words:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: sentence

    transforms:
      - operator: flat-map
        run: |
          fn sentence_to_words(sentence: String) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
            Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
          }
      - operator: map
        run: |
          pub fn augment_count(word: String) -&gt; Result&lt;String&gt; {
            Ok(format!(&quot;{}({})&quot;, word, word.chars().count()))
          }

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: words
```

### Step 5. Run the DataFlow

Use sdf command line tool to run the dataflow:

```bash
sdf run --ui
```
&gt; The --ui flag serves the graphical representation of the dataflow on SDF Studio.

### Step 6. Test the DataFlow

Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:
```bash
fluvio produce sentence
```
Input some text, for example:
```bash
Hello world
Hi there
```
Consume from `words` to retrieve the result:
```bash
fluvio consume words -Bd
```
See the results, for example:
```bash
Hello(1)
world(1)
Hi(1)
there(1)
```

### Step 6. Inspect State

The dataflow collects runtime metrics that you can inspect in the runtime terminal.

Check the sentence-to-words counters:
```bash
show state sentence-words/sentence-to-words/metrics
```
See results, for example:
```bash
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       2          0
 ```
 Check the augment-count counters:
 ```bash
 show state sentence-words/augment-count/metrics
 ```
 See results, for example:
 ```bash
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       4          0
 ```
Congratulations! You&#039;ve successfully built and run a composable dataflow!

#### Learn how to build custom connectors
Fluvio can connect to practically any system that you can think of.
- For first party systems, fluvio clients can integrate with the edge system or application to source data.
- For third party systems fluvio connectors connect at the protocol level and collects data into fluvio topics.

Out of the box Fluvio has native http, webhook, mqtt, kafka inbound connectors. In terms of outbound connectors out of the box Fluvio supports http, SQL, kafka, and experimental builds of DuckDB, Redis, S3, Graphite etc.

Using Connector Development Kit, its intuitive to build connectors to any system fast.

Check out the docs and let us know if you need help building any connector.

## Polars: Blazingly fast DataFrames in Rust, Python, Node.js, R, and SQL

Polars is a DataFrame interface on top of an OLAP Query Engine implemented in Rust using
[Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html) as the memory
model.

- Lazy | eager execution
- Multi-threaded
- SIMD
- Query optimization
- Powerful expression API
- Hybrid Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Rust | Python | NodeJS | R | ...

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Python

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import polars as pl
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pl.DataFrame(
...     {
...         &quot;A&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
...         &quot;fruits&quot;: [&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;],
...         &quot;B&quot;: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
...         &quot;cars&quot;: [&quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;audi&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;],
...     }
... )

# embarrassingly parallel execution &amp; very expressive query language
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.sort(&quot;fruits&quot;).select(
...     &quot;fruits&quot;,
...     &quot;cars&quot;,
...     pl.lit(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;literal_string_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;B&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;cars&quot;) == &quot;beetle&quot;).sum(),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;B&quot;) &gt; 2).sum().over(&quot;cars&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_cars&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sum().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).reverse().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;rev_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sort_by(&quot;B&quot;).over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sort_A_by_B_by_fruits&quot;),

SQL commands can also be run directly from your terminal using the Polars CLI:

```bash
# run an inline SQL query
&gt; polars -c &quot;SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;&quot;

# run interactively
&gt; polars
Polars CLI v0.3.0
Type .help for help.

&gt; SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;
```

Refer to the [Polars CLI repository](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-cli) for more information.

## Performance üöÄüöÄ

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is
still very fast!)

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

We also have a conda package (`conda install -c conda-forge polars`), however pip is the preferred
way to install Polars.

Install Polars with all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[all]&#039;
```

You can also install a subset of all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[numpy,pandas,pyarrow]&#039;
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating Polars regularly to
get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features /
performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```toml
polars = { git = &quot;https://github.com/pola-rs/polars&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;optional git tag&gt;&quot; }
```

Requires Rust version `&gt;=1.80`.

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

## What is it?

- Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html).
- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## Demo

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

[![demo](./docs/tapes/demo.gif)](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

See [demo transcript](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html).

## Quickstart

### Install mise

See [Getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for more options.

```sh-session
$ curl https://mise.run | sh
$ ~/.local/bin/mise --version
2025.4.9 macos-arm64 (a1b2d3e 2025-04-25)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@22 -- node -v
mise node@22.x.x ‚úì installed
v22.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@22 go@1
$ node -v
v22.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

# Welcome to Sui

[![Github release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/MystenLabs/sui.svg?sort=semver)](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/latest)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/MystenLabs/sui)](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/LICENSE)

[Sui](https://sui.io) is a next-generation smart contract platform with high throughput, low latency, and an asset-oriented programming model powered by the [Move programming language](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move).

## Sui Highlights

Sui offers the following benefits and capabilities:

 * Unmatched scalability, instant settlement
 * A safe smart contract language accessible to mainstream developers
 * Ability to define rich and composable on-chain assets
 * Better user experience for web3 apps

Sui is the only blockchain today that can scale with the growth of web3 while achieving industry-leading performance, cost, programmability, and usability. As Sui approaches Mainnet launch, it will demonstrate capacity beyond the transaction processing capabilities of established systems ‚Äì traditional and blockchain alike. Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform, a foundational layer for web3.

## Sui Overview

Sui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of authorities that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.

Sui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for common use cases. Sui makes the vast majority of transactions processable in parallel, which makes better use of processing resources, and offers the option to increase throughput with more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for common use cases, such as payment transactions and asset transfers. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications, ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.

Sui is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and supports smart contracts written in the [Move programming language](https://github.com/move-language/move) to define assets that may have an owner. Move programs define operations on these assets including custom rules for their creation, the transfer of these assets to new owners, and operations that mutate assets.

Sui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and is also used as [delegated stake on authorities](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos/) within an epoch. The voting power of authorities within this epoch is a function of this delegated stake. Authorities are periodically reconfigured according to the stake delegated to them. In any epoch, the set of authorities is [Byzantine fault tolerant](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to authorities according to their contribution to the operation of the system. Authorities can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that delegated stakes to them.

Sui is supported by several cutting-edge [peer-reviewed studies](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/concepts/research-papers.mdx) and extensive years of open-source development.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

Candle is a minimalist ML framework for Rust with a focus on performance (including GPU support) 
and ease of use. Try our online demos: 
[whisper](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-whisper),
[LLaMA2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2),
[T5](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/Candle-T5-Generation-Wasm),
[yolo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-yolo),
[Segment
Anything](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/candle-segment-anything-wasm).

## Get started

Make sure that you have [`candle-core`](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/tree/main/candle-core) correctly installed as described in [**Installation**](https://huggingface.github.io/candle/guide/installation.html).

Let&#039;s see how to run a simple matrix multiplication.
Write the following to your `myapp/src/main.rs` file:
```rust
use candle_core::{Device, Tensor};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let device = Device::Cpu;

    let a = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (2, 3), &amp;device)?;
    let b = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (3, 4), &amp;device)?;

    let c = a.matmul(&amp;b)?;
    println!(&quot;{c}&quot;);
    Ok(())
}
```

`cargo run` should display a tensor of shape `Tensor[[2, 4], f32]`.


Having installed `candle` with Cuda support, simply define the `device` to be on GPU:

```diff
- let device = Device::Cpu;
+ let device = Device::new_cuda(0)?;
```

For more advanced examples, please have a look at the following section.

## FAQ

### Why should I use Candle?

&lt;!--- ANCHOR: goals ---&gt;

Candle&#039;s core goal is to *make serverless inference possible*. Full machine learning frameworks like PyTorch
are very large, which makes creating instances on a cluster slow. Candle allows deployment of lightweight
binaries.

Secondly, Candle lets you *remove Python* from production workloads. Python overhead can seriously hurt performance,
and the [GIL](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-python-gil-past-present-and-future/) is a notorious source of headaches.

Finally, Rust is cool! A lot of the HF ecosystem already has Rust crates, like [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) and [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).

&lt;!--- ANCHOR_END: goals ---&gt;

### Other ML frameworks

- [dfdx](https://github.com/coreylowman/dfdx) is a formidable crate, with shapes being included
  in types. This prevents a lot of headaches by getting the compiler to complain about shape mismatches right off the bat.
  However, we found that some features still require nightly, and writing code can be a bit daunting for non rust experts.

  We&#039;re leveraging and contributing to other core crates for the runtime so hopefully both crates can benefit from each
  other.

- [burn](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn) is a general crate that can leverage multiple backends so you can choose the best
  engine for your workload.

- [tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs.git) Bindings to the torch library in Rust. Extremely versatile, but they 
  bring in the entire torch library into the runtime. The main contributor of `tch-rs` is also involved in the development
  of `candle`.

### Common Errors

#### Missing symbols when compiling with the mkl feature.

If you get some missing symbols when compiling binaries/tests using the mkl
or accelerate features, e.g. for mkl you get:
```
  = note: /usr/bin/ld: (....o): in function `blas::sgemm&#039;:
          .../blas-0.22.0/src/lib.rs:1944: undefined reference to `sgemm_&#039; collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  = note: some `extern` functions couldn&#039;t be found; some native libraries may need to be installed or have their path specified
  = note: use the `-l` flag to specify native libraries to link
  = note: use the `cargo:rustc-link-lib` directive to specify the native libraries to link with Cargo
```
or for accelerate:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
            &quot;_dgemm_&quot;, referenced from:
                candle_core::accelerate::dgemm::h1b71a038552bcabe in libcandle_core...
            &quot;_sgemm_&quot;, referenced from:
                candle_core::accelerate::sgemm::h2cf21c592cba3c47 in libcandle_core...
          ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
```

This is likely due to a missing linker flag that was needed to enable the mkl library. You
can try adding the following for mkl at the top of your binary:
```rust
extern crate intel_mkl_src;
```
or for accelerate:
```rust
extern crate accelerate_src;
```

#### Cannot run the LLaMA examples: access to source requires login credentials

```
Error: request error: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf/resolve/main/tokenizer.json: status code 401
```

This is likely because you&#039;re not permissioned for the LLaMA-v2 model. To fix
this, you have to register on the huggingface-hub, accept the [LLaMA-v2 model
conditions](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf), and set up your
authentication token. See issue
[#350](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/350) for more details.

#### Missing cute/cutlass headers when compiling flash-attn

```
  In file included from kernels/flash_fwd_launch_template.h:11:0,
                   from kernels/flash_fwd_hdim224_fp16_sm80.cu:5:

[English] | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá]


Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

- nushell
- xonsh

## Community

### Forum

Atuin has a community forum, please ask here for help and support: https://forum.atuin.sh/

### Discord

Atuin also has a community Discord, available [here](https://discord.gg/jR3tfchVvW)

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

# Security

If you find any security issues, we&#039;d appreciate it if you could alert ellie@atuin.sh

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ÀàdiÀêno ä/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found in the manual
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/references/contributing/building_from_source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).
