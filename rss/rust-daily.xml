## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust&#039;s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on
correctly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
&gt; the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
&gt; We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

Install optional dependencies as &#039;extras&#039; for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):

```bash
pip install -U &quot;nautilus_trader[docker,ib]&quot;
```

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |

**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.
Skipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, in

&lt;!-- description:start --&gt;
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the
language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.

*prek* is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust.
It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it,
while also providing some additional long-requested features.
&lt;!-- description:end --&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Although prek is pretty new, it’s already powering real‑world projects like [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi), and more projects are picking it up—see [Who is using prek?](#who-is-using-prek). If you’re looking for an alternative to `pre-commit`, please give it a try—we’d love your feedback!
&gt;
&gt; Please note that some subcommands and languages are still missing for full drop‑in parity with `pre-commit`. Track the remaining gaps here: [TODO](https://prek.j178.dev/todo/).

&lt;!-- features:start --&gt;
## Features

- 🚀 A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- ⚡ [Faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and more efficient in disk space usage.
- 🔄 Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- 🏗️ Built-in support for monorepos (i.e. [workspace mode](https://prek.j178.dev/workspace/)).
- 🐍 Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- 🛠️ Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- 📦 [Built-in](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/) Rust-native implementation of some common hooks.

&lt;summary&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;!-- github-actions:start --&gt;
prek can be used in GitHub Actions via the [j178/prek-action](https://github.com/j178/prek-action) repository.

Example workflow:

```yaml
name: Prek checks
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  prek:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: j178/prek-action@v1
```

This action installs prek and runs `prek run --all-files` on your repository.

prek is also available via [`taiki-e/install-action`](https://github.com/taiki-e/install-action) for installing various tools.
&lt;!-- github-actions:end --&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;!-- self-update:start --&gt;
If installed via the standalone installer, prek can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
prek self update
```
&lt;!-- self-update:end --&gt;

## Quick start

- **I already use pre-commit:** follow the short migration checklist in the [quickstart guide](https://prek.j178.dev/quickstart/#already-using-pre-commit) to swap in `prek` safely.
- **I&#039;m new to pre-commit-style tools:** learn the basics—creating a config, running hooks, and installing git hooks—in the [beginner quickstart walkthrough](https://prek.j178.dev/quickstart/#new-to-pre-commit-style-workflows).

&lt;!-- why:start --&gt;
## Why prek?

### prek is faster

- It is [multiple times faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and takes up half the disk space.
- It redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.
- Repositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.
- Hooks can run in parallel by priority (hooks with the same [`priority`](https://prek.j178.dev/configuration/#priority) may run concurrently), reducing end-to-end runtime.
- It uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.
- It implements some common hooks in Rust, [built in prek](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/), which are faster than their Python counterparts.
- It supports `repo: builtin` for offline, zero-setup hooks, which is not available in `pre-commit`.

### prek provides a better user experience

- No need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.
- No hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.
- Built-in support for [workspaces](https://prek.j178.dev/workspace/) (or monorepos), each subproject can have its own `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
- [`prek run`](https://prek.j178.dev/cli/#prek-run) has some nifty improvements over `pre-commit run`, such as:
  - `prek run --directory &lt;dir&gt;` runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use `git ls-files -- &lt;dir&gt; | xargs pre-commit run --files` anymore.
  - `prek run --last-commit` runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.
  - `prek run [HOOK] [HOOK]` selects and runs multiple hooks.
- [`prek list`](https://prek.j178.dev/cli/#prek-list) command lists all available hooks, their ids, and descriptions, providing a better overview of the configured hooks.
- [`prek auto-update`](https://prek.j178.dev/cli/#prek-auto-update) supports `--cooldown-days` to mitigate open source supply chain attacks.
- prek provides shell completions for `prek run &lt;hook_id&gt;` command, making it easier to run specific hooks without remembering their ids.

For more detailed improvements prek offers, take a look at [Difference from pre-commit](https://prek.j178.dev/diff/).

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn&#039;t be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I&#039;ve learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.

&gt; **January 2026**: Worktrunk was [released](https://x.com/max_sixty/status/2006077845391724739?s=20) over the holidays, and lots of folks seem to be using it. It&#039;s built with love (there&#039;s no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), &amp; [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg). Please let me know any frictions at all; I&#039;m intensely focused on making Worktrunk excellent, and the biggest gap is understanding how others experience using it.

Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for running AI agents in parallel.

Worktrunk&#039;s three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches. Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows.

Scaling agents becomes trivial. A quick demo:

&lt;!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from docs/content/worktrunk.md#context-git-worktrees..worktrunk-makes-git-worktrees-as-easy-as-branches — edit source to update --&gt;

## Context: git worktrees

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without
supervision, such that it&#039;s possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git&#039;s native
worktree feature give each agent its own working directory, so they don&#039;t step
on each other&#039;s changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new
worktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat
../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.

## Worktrunk makes git worktrees as easy as branches

Worktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template.

&gt; Start with the core commands

**Core commands:**

&lt;table class=&quot;cmd-compare&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Task&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Worktrunk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Plain git&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Switch worktrees&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt switch feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd ../repo.feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Create + start Claude&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt switch -c -x claude feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
cd ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
claude&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Clean up&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt remove&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd ../repo &amp;&amp; \
git worktree remove ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
git branch -d feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;List with status&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt list&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git worktree list&lt;/pre&gt; (paths only)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

**Workflow automation:**

&gt; Expand into the more advanced commands as needed

- **[Hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc
- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs via [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/)
- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- ...and **[lots more](#next-steps)**

A demo with some advanced features:

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS &amp; Linux):**

```bash
brew install worktrunk &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

Shell integration allows commands to change directories.

**Cargo:**

```bash
cargo install worktrunk &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

On Windows, `wt` defaults to Windows Terminal&#039;s command. Winget additionally installs Worktrunk as `git-wt` to avoid the conflict:

```bash
winget install max-sixty.worktrunk
git-wt config shell install
```

Alternatively, disable Windows Terminal&#039;s alias (Settings → Privacy &amp; security → For developers → App Execution Aliases → disable &quot;Windows Terminal&quot;) to use `wt` directly.

&lt;/details&gt;

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
paru worktrunk-bin &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

## Next steps

- Learn the core commands: [`wt switch`](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/), [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/), [`wt merge`](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/), [`wt remove`](https://worktrunk.dev/remove/)
- Set up [project hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) for automated setup
- Explore [LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/), [fzf-like
  selector](https://worktrunk.dev/select/), [Claude Code integration](https://worktrunk.dev/claude-code/), [CI
  status &amp; PR links](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#ci-status)
- Run `wt --help` or `wt &lt;command&gt; --help` for quick CLI reference

## About

Turso Database is an in-process SQL database written in Rust, compatible with SQLite.

&gt; **⚠️ Warning:** This software is in BETA. It may still contain bugs and unexpected behavior. Use caution with production data and ensure you have backups.

## Features and Roadmap

* **SQLite compatibility** for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API [see [document](COMPAT.md) for details]
* **Change data capture (CDC)** for real-time tracking of database changes.
* **Multi-language support** for
  * [Go](bindings/go)
  * [JavaScript](bindings/javascript)
  * [Java](bindings/java)
  * [Python](bindings/python)
  * [Rust](bindings/rust)
  * [WebAssembly](bindings/javascript)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **Cross-platform** support for Linux, macOS, Windows and browsers (through WebAssembly)
* **Vector support** support including exact search and vector manipulation
* **Improved schema management** including extended `ALTER` support and faster schema changes.

The database has the following experimental features:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput using multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
* **Encryption at rest** for protecting the data locally.
* **Incremental computation** using DBSP for incremental view maintenance and query subscriptions.
* **Full-Text-Search** powered by the awesome [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) library

The following features are on our current roadmap:

* **Vector indexing** for fast approximate vector search, similar to [libSQL vector search](https://turso.tech/vector).

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the interactive shell:

```shell
$ tursodb
```

This will start the Turso interactive shell where you can execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```

If you like docker, we got you covered. Simply run this in the root folder:

```bash
make docker-cli-build &amp;&amp; \
make docker-cli-run
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/database
```

Example usage:

```js
import { connect } from &#039;@tursodatabase/database&#039;;

const db = await connect(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
uv pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦫 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
go get turso.tech/database/tursogo
go install turso.tech/database/tursogo
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;turso.tech/database/tursogo&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;turso&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;☕️ Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Turso Database into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Turso Database with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🤖 MCP Server Mode&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


The Turso CLI includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your databases.

Start the MCP server with:

```shell
tursodb your_database.db --mcp
```

### Configuration

Add Turso to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;turso&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/.turso/tursodb&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/your/database.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides nine tools for database interaction:

1. **`open_database`** - Open a new database
2. **`current_database`** - Describe the current database
3. **`list_tables`** - List all tables in the database
4. **`describe_table`** - Describe the structure of a specific table
5. **`execute_query`** - Execute read-only SELECT queries
6. **`insert_data`** - Insert new data into tables
7. **`update_data`** - Update existing data in tables
8. **`delete_data`** - Delete data from tables
9. **`schema_change`** - Execute schema modification statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant:

- &quot;Show me all tables in the database&quot;
- &quot;What&#039;s the schema for the users table?&quot;
- &quot;Find all posts with more than 100 upvotes&quot;
- &quot;Insert a new user with name &#039;Alice&#039; and email &#039;alice@example.com&#039;&quot;

### MCP Clients

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Code&lt;/summary&gt;

If you&#039;re using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), you can easily connect to your Turso MCP server using the built-in MCP management commands:

#### Quick Setup

1. **Add the MCP server** to Claude Code:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to activate the connection

3. **Start querying** your database through natural language!

#### Command Breakdown

```bash
claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
#              ↑            ↑       ↑                           ↑
#              |            |       |                           |
#              Name         |       Database path               MCP flag
#                          Separator
```

- **`my-database`** - Choose any name for your MCP server
- **`--`** - Required separator between Claude options and your command
- **`tursodb`** - The Turso database CLI
- **`./path/to/your/database.db`** - Path to your SQLite database file
- **`--mcp`** - Enables MCP server mode

#### Example Usage

```bash
# For a local project database
cd /your/project
claude mcp add my-project-db -- tursodb ./data/app.db --mcp

# For an absolute path
claude mcp add analytics-db -- tursodb /Users/you/databases/analytics.db --mcp

# For a specific project (local scope)
claude mcp add project-db --local -- tursodb ./database.db --mcp
```

#### Managing MCP Servers

```bash
# List all configured MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Get details about a specific server
claude mcp get my-database

# Remove an MCP server
claude mcp remove my-database
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Desktop&lt;/summary&gt;

For Claude Desktop, add the configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;turso&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/.turso/tursodb&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;./path/to/your/database.db.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cursor&lt;/summary&gt;

For Cursor, configure MCP in your settings:

1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to Extensions → MCP
3. Add a new server with:
   - **Name**: `turso`
   - **Command**: `/path/to/.turso/tursodb`
   - **Args**: `[&quot;./path/to/your/database.db.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]`

Alternatively, you can add it to your Cursor configuration file directly.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Direct JSON-RPC Usage

The MCP server runs as a single process that handles multiple JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout. Here&#039;s how to interact with it directly:

#### Example with In-Memory Database

```bash
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;schema_change&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 4, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;insert_data&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;Alice&#039;, &#039;alice@example.com&#039;)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;execute_query&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;}}}
EOF
```

#### Example with Existing Database

```bash
# Working with an existing database file
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb mydb.db --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
EOF
```

&lt;/details&gt;

We&#039;d love to have you contribute to Turso Database! Please check out the [contribution guide] to get started.

### Found a data corruption bug? Get up to $1,000.00

SQLite is loved because it is the most reliable database in the world. The next evolution of SQLite has
to match or surpass this level of reliability. Turso is built with [Deterministic Simulation Testing](simulator/)
from the ground up, and is also tested by [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com).

Even during Alpha, if you find a bug that leads to a data corruption and demonstrate
how our simulator failed to catch it, you can get up to $1,000.00. As the project matures we will
increase the size of the prize, and the scope of the bugs.

List of rewarded cases:

* B-Tree interior cell replacement issue in btrees with depth &gt;=3 ([#2106](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/issues/2106))
* Don&#039;t allow autovacuum to be flipped on non-empty databases ([#3830](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/pull/3830))

More details [here](https://turso.algora.io).

Turso core staff are not eligible.

## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection(&quot;all-my-documents&quot;)

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=[&quot;This is document1&quot;, &quot;This is document2&quot;], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;notion&quot;}, {&quot;source&quot;: &quot;google-docs&quot;}], # filter on these!
    ids=[&quot;doc1&quot;, &quot;doc2&quot;], # unique for each doc
)

# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=[&quot;This is a query document&quot;],
    n_results=2,
    # where={&quot;metadata_field&quot;: &quot;is_equal_to_this&quot;}, # optional filter
    # where_document={&quot;$contains&quot;:&quot;search_string&quot;}  # optional filter

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># libc - Raw FFI bindings to platforms&#039; system libraries

[![GHA Status]][GitHub Actions] [![Cirrus CI Status]][Cirrus CI] [![Latest Version]][crates.io] [![Documentation]][docs.rs] ![License]

`libc` provides all of the definitions necessary to easily interoperate with C
code (or &quot;C-like&quot; code) on each of the platforms that Rust supports. This
includes type definitions (e.g. `c_int`), constants (e.g. `EINVAL`) as well as
function headers (e.g. `malloc`).

This crate exports all underlying platform types, functions, and constants under
the crate root, so all items are accessible as `libc::foo`. The types and values
of all the exported APIs match the platform that libc is compiled for.

Windows API bindings are not included in this crate. If you are looking for
WinAPI bindings, consider using crates like [windows-sys].

More detailed information about the design of this library can be found in its
[associated RFC][rfc].

[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/HEAD/text/1291-promote-libc.md
[windows-sys]: https://docs.rs/windows-sys

## v1.0 Roadmap

Currently, `libc` has two active branches: `main` for the upcoming v1.0 release,
and `libc-0.2` for the currently published version. By default all pull requests
should target `main`; once reviewed, they can be cherry picked to the `libc-0.2`
branch if needed.

We will stop making new v0.2 releases once v1.0 is released.

See the section in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#v10-roadmap) for more
details.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libc = &quot;0.2&quot;
```

## Features

* `std`: by default `libc` links to the standard library. Disable this feature
  to remove this dependency and be able to use `libc` in `#![no_std]` crates.

* `extra_traits`: all `struct`s implemented in `libc` are `Copy` and `Clone`.
  This feature derives `Debug`, `Eq`, `Hash`, and `PartialEq`.

## Rust version support

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently **Rust 1.63**.

Increases to the MSRV are allowed to change without a major (i.e. semver-
breaking) release in order to avoid a ripple effect in the ecosystem. A policy
for when this may change is a work in progress.

`libc` may continue to compile with Rust versions older than the current MSRV
but this is not guaranteed.

## Platform support

You can see the platform(target)-specific docs on [docs.rs], select a platform
you want to see.

See [`ci/verify-build.py`](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/HEAD/ci/verify-build.py) for
the platforms on which `libc` is guaranteed to build for each Rust toolchain.
The test-matrix at [GitHub Actions] and [Cirrus CI] show the platforms in which
`libc` tests are run.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Wild linker

Wild is a linker with the goal of being very fast for iterative development.

The plan is to eventually make it incremental, however that isn&#039;t yet implemented. It is however
already pretty fast even without incremental linking.

## Installation

### From GitHub releases

Download a tarball from the [releases page](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild/releases). Unpack
it and copy the `wild` binary somewhere on your path.

### Cargo binstall

If you have [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall), you can install wild as
follows:

```sh
cargo binstall wild-linker
```

### Build latest release from crates.io

```sh
cargo install --locked wild-linker
```

### Build from git head

To build and install the latest, unreleased code:

```sh
cargo install --locked --bin wild --git https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild.git wild-linker
```

### Nix

To use a stable Wild from Nixpkgs:

```nix
let
 wildStdenv = pkgs.useWildLinker pkgs.stdenv;
in
pkgs.callPackage ./package { stdenv = wildStdenv; }  
```

to use the latest unstable git revision of wild, see [the nix documentation](./nix/nix.md)

## Using as your default linker

If you&#039;d like to use Wild as your default linker for building Rust code, you can put the following
in `~/.cargo/config.toml`.

On Linux:
```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = &quot;clang&quot;
rustflags = [&quot;-Clink-arg=--ld-path=wild&quot;]
```

Alternatively, you can create symlink `ld.wild` pointing to `wild` and use:
```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = &quot;clang&quot;
rustflags = [&quot;-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=wild&quot;]
```
The above steps also work for clang when building C/C++ code, just add the following to your LDFLAGS
after adding the `ld.wild` symlink:
```
export LDFLAGS=&quot;${LDFLAGS} -fuse-ld=wild&quot;
```
GCC doesn&#039;t have [native](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2025-November/145870.html) support for `wild` in any released version yet. You can make it force use it with the [-Bprefix](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Directory-Options.html#index-B) option. Create a symlink `ld` pointing to `wild` and pass the directory containing it to gcc. For example you can do the following:
```
ln -s /usr/bin/wild /tmp/ld
```
And when compiling C/C++ code pass the directory containing `ld` to your CFLAGS,CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS:
```
export CFLAGS=&quot;${CFLAGS} -B/tmp&quot;
export CXXFLAGS=&quot;${CXXFLAGS} -B/tmp&quot;
export LDFLAGS=&quot;${LDFLAGS} -B/tmp&quot;
```
Afterwards you can check if wild was used for linking with [readelf](#how-can-i-verify-that-wild-was-used-to-link-a-binary)

On Illumos:
```
[target.x86_64-unknown-illumos]
# Absolute path to clang - on OmniOS this is likely something like /opt/ooce/bin/clang.
linker = &quot;/usr/bin/clang&quot;

rustflags = [
    # Will silently delegate to GNU ld or Sun ld unless the absolute path to Wild is provided.
    &quot;-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=/absolute/path/to/wild&quot;
]
```

## Using wild in CI

If you&#039;d like to use Wild as your linker for Rust code in CI, see
[wild-action](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild-action).

## Q&amp;A

### Why another linker?

Mold is already very fast, however it doesn&#039;t do incremental linking and the author has stated that
they don&#039;t intend to. Wild doesn&#039;t do incremental linking yet, but that is the end-goal. By writing
Wild in Rust, it&#039;s hoped that the complexity of incremental linking will be achievable.

### What&#039;s working?

The following platforms / architectures are currently supported:

* x86-64 on Linux
* ARM64 on Linux
* RISC-V (riscv64gc) on Linux
* LoongArch64 on Linux (initial support)

The following is working with the caveat that there may be bugs:

* Output to statically linked, non-relocatable binaries
* Output to statically linked, position-independent binaries (static-PIE)
* Output to dynamically linked binaries
* Output to shared objects (.so files)
* Rust proc-macros, when linked with Wild work
* Most of the top downloaded crates on crates.io have been tested with Wild and pass their tests
* Debug info
* GNU jobserver support
* Very basic linker script support (section mapping, keeping sections, alignment, defining start /
  stop symbols).

### What isn&#039;t yet supported?

Lots of stuff. Here are some of the larger things that aren&#039;t yet done, roughly sorted by current
priority:

* Incremental linking
* Support for more architectures
* Support for a wider range of linker flags
* More complex linker scripts
* Mac support
* Windows support
* LTO

### How can I verify that Wild was used to link a binary?

Install `readelf` (available from binutils package), then run:

```sh
readelf --string-dump .comment my-executable
```

Look for a line like:

```
Linker: Wild version 0.1.0
```

You can probably also get away with `strings` (also available from binutils package):

```sh
strings my-executable | grep &#039;Linker:&#039;
```

### Where did the name come from?

It&#039;s somewhat of a tradition for linkers to end with the letters &quot;ld&quot;. e.g. &quot;GNU ld, &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;lld&quot;,
&quot;mold&quot;. Since the end-goal is for the linker to be incremental, an &quot;I&quot; is added. Let&#039;s say the &quot;W&quot;
stands for &quot;Wild&quot;, since recursive acronyms are popular in open-source projects.

## Benchmarks

The goal of Wild is to eventually be very fast via incremental linking. However, we also want to be
as fast as we can be for non-incremental linking and for the initial link when incremental linking
is enabled.

All benchmarks are run with output to a tmpfs. See [BENCHMARKING.md](BENCHMARKING.md) for details on
running benchmarks.

We run benchmarks on a few different systems:

* [Ryzen 9 9955HX (16 core, 32 thread)](benchmarks/ryzen-9955hx.md)
* [2020 era Intel-based laptop with 4 cores and 8 threads](benchmarks/lemp9.md)
* [Raspberry Pi 5](benchmarks/raspberrypi.md)

Here&#039;s a few highlights.

### Ryzen 9955HX (16 core, 32 thread)

First, we link the Chrome web browser (or technically, Chromium).

![Benchmark of linking chrome-crel](benchmarks/images/ryzen-9955hx/chrome-crel-time.svg)

Memory consumption when linking Chromium:

![Benchmark of linking chrome-crel](benchmarks/images/ryzen-9955hx/chrome-crel-memory.svg)

librustc-driver is the shared object where most of the code in the Rust compiler lives. This
benchmark shows the time to link it.

![Benchmark of linking librustc-driver](benchmarks/images/ryzen-9955hx/librustc-driver-time.svg)

For something much smaller, this is the time to link Wild itself. This also shows a few different
Wild versions, so you can see how the link time has been tracking over releases.

![Benchmark of linking wild](benchmarks/images/ryzen-9955hx/wild-time.svg)

### Raspberry Pi 5

Here&#039;s linking rust-analyzer on a Raspberry Pi 5.

![Time to link rust-analyzer-no-debug](benchmarks/images/raspberrypi/rust-analyzer-no-debug-time.svg)

## Linking Rust code

The following is a `cargo test` command-line that can be used to build and test a crate using Wild.
This has been run successfully on a few popular crates (e.g. ripgrep, serde, tokio, rand, bitflags).
It assumes that the &quot;wild&quot; binary is on your path. It also depends on the Clang compiler being
installed, since GCC doesn&#039;t allow using an arbitrary linker.

```sh
RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-Clinker=clang -Clink-args=--ld-path=wild&quot; cargo test
```

Alternatively, with `ld.wild` symlink pointing at `wild`:
```sh
RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-Clinker=clang -Clink-args=-fuse-ld=wild&quot; cargo test
```

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What Can I Do with Hyperswitch?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Hyperswitch offers a modular, open-source payments infrastructure designed for flexibility and control. Apart from our Payment Suite offering, this solution allows businesses to pick and integrate only the modules they need on top of their existing payment stack — without unnecessary complexity or vendor lock-in.

Each module is independent and purpose-built to optimize different aspects of payment processing.

## Why Hyperswitch?

Hyperswitch is a commercial open-source payments stack purpose-built for scale, flexibility, and developer experience. Designed with a modular architecture, Hyperswitch lets you pick only the components you need—whether it’s routing, retries, vaulting, or observability—without vendor lock-in or bloated integrations.

Built in Rust for performance and reliability, Hyperswitch supports global payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL, UPI, Pay by Bank), exposes smart routing and retry logic, and provides a visual workflow builder in the Control Center. Whether you&#039;re integrating a full payment suite or augmenting an existing stack with a single module, Hyperswitch meets you where you are.

&lt;strong&gt;“Linux for Payments”&lt;/strong&gt; — Hyperswitch is a well-architected reference for teams who want to own their payments stack.

We believe in:

- &lt;strong&gt; Embracing Payment Diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; Innovation comes from enabling choice—across payment methods, processors, and flows.

- &lt;strong&gt; Open Source by Default:&lt;/strong&gt; Transparency drives trust and builds better, reusable software.

- &lt;strong&gt; Community-Driven Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Our roadmap is shaped by real-world use cases and contributors. 

- &lt;strong&gt; Systems-Level Engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; We hold ourselves to a high bar for reliability, security, and performance.

- &lt;strong&gt; Maximizing Value Creation:&lt;/strong&gt; For developers, customers, and partners alike.

- &lt;strong&gt; Community-Driven, Enterprise-Tested:&lt;/strong&gt; Hyperswitch is built in the open with real-world feedback from developers and contributors, and maintained by Juspay, the team powering payment infrastructure for 400+ leading enterprises worldwide.

## Overview

[Seelen UI](https://seelen.io/apps/seelen-ui) is a tool designed to enhance your Windows desktop experience with a focus
on customization and productivity. It integrates smoothly into your system, providing a range of features that allow you
to personalize your desktop and optimize your workflow.

- **Be Creative**: Seelen UI lets you tailor your desktop to fit your style and needs. You can adjust menus, widgets,
  icons, and other elements to create a personalized and visually appealing desktop environment.

  ![Seelen UI Custom Theme](./documentation/images/theme_preview.png)

&lt;br/&gt;

- **Enhance Your Productivity**: Seelen UI helps you organize your desktop efficiently. With a Tiling Windows Manager,
  windows automatically arrange themselves to support multitasking, making your work more streamlined.

  ![Seelen UI Tiling Window Manager](./documentation/images/twm_preview.png)

&lt;br/&gt;

- **Enjoy your music**: With an integrated media module that&#039;s compatible with most music players, Seelen UI allows you
  to enjoy your music seamlessly. You can pause, resume, and skip tracks at any time without the need to open additional
  windows.

  ![Seelen UI Media Module](./documentation/images/media_module_preview.png)

&lt;br/&gt;

- **Be faster!**: With an app launcher inspired by Rofi, Seelen UI provides a simple and intuitive way to quickly access
  your applications and execute commands.

  ![Seelen UI App Launcher](./documentation/images/app_launcher_preview.png)

&lt;br/&gt;

- **User-Friendly Configuration**: Seelen UI offers an intuitive interface for easy customization. Adjust settings such
  as themes, taskbar layouts, icons, etc. With just a few clicks.

&lt;br/&gt;

## Installation

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Seelen UI requires the WebView runtime to be installed. On Windows 11, it comes pre-installed with the system.
&gt; However, on Windows 10, the WebView runtime is included with the `setup.exe` installer. Additionally, Microsoft Edge
&gt; is necessary to function correctly. Some users may have modified their system and removed Edge, so please ensure both
&gt; Edge and the WebView runtime are installed on your system.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; On fresh installations of Windows, the app might show a white or dark screen. You only need to update your Windows
&gt; through Windows Update and restart your PC.

You can choose from different installation options based on your preference:

### Microsoft Store &lt;em&gt;(recommended)&lt;/em&gt;

Download the latest version from the [Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P67C2D4T9FB?ocid=pdpshare) page.
This is the recommended option because you will receive updates and a secure version of the program.

_**Note**_: It may take around 1 to 3 business days for changes to be reflected in the Microsoft Store, as updates are
approved by real people in the store.

### Winget

Install the latest version using:

```pwsh
winget install --id Seelen.SeelenUI
```

This option also uses the signed `.msix` package and ensures you have the latest secure version. Similar to the
Microsoft Store, it may take around 1 to 3 business days for changes to be reflected in Winget, as updates are approved
by real people in the `winget-pkg` project.

### .msix Installer

Download the `.msix` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/eythaann/seelen-ui/releases) page. This package is
signed, ensuring a secure installation. This is the same option as the Microsoft Store but is a portable installer.

### .exe Installer

Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/eythaann/seelen-ui/releases) page and run the
`setup.exe` installer. This option is less recommended as the installer is not signed, which may cause it to be flagged
as a potential threat by some antivirus programs. The `setup.exe` is updated more quickly than the Microsoft Store or
Winget versions and also it receives notifications updates on new release.

## Usage

Once installed or extracted, simply open the program. The easy-to-use and intuitive GUI will guide you through the
configuration process. Customize your desktop environment effortlessly.

## Documentation

For in-depth details on various aspects of Seelen UI, explore the following documents:

- [Languages](./documentation/languages.md) - Information regarding translations.
- [Toolbar](./documentation/toolbar.md) - Details about customizing and using the toolbar.
- [Themes](https://seelen.io/blog/seelen-ui-theme-tutorial) - Guidance on creating and applying themes.
- [Window Manager](./documentation/window_manager.md) - Instructions on configuring the window manager.
- [Project](./documentation/project.md) - General information about the project and its structure.

## Upcoming Features

I’m excited to share some upcoming features for Seelen UI! Here’s a glimpse of what’s planned for the future:

### ~~App Launcher~~ ✅

I’m planning to develop an app launcher inspired by [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) on Linux. This feature
will provide a sleek and highly customizable way to quickly access your applications.

### Customizable Popup Widgets

I aim to introduce a set of fully customizable popup widgets, similar to the features available in
[EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww). These widgets will be highly configurable and adaptable to your needs, providing
an enhanced and interactive way to manage your desktop environment.

### Custom Alt + Tab (Task Switching)

An upgraded Alt + Tab system for task switching is on the horizon. This will offer a more visually appealing and
functional experience, allowing for smoother transitions between open applications and windows.

### Custom Virtual Desktops Viewer and Animations

I’m also working on a custom virtual desktops viewer and dynamic animations to improve navigation between different
workspaces. This will provide a more intuitive and immersive multitasking experience.

Stay tuned for more updates as I develop these features. I appreciate your support and enthusiasm!

Happy customizing!

#### Memory Allocators

This project uses system (libc) memory allocator (Rust&#039;s default). But it also allows you to use other famous allocators by features:

- `jemalloc` - Uses [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) as global memory allocator
- `mimalloc` - Uses [mi-malloc](https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc/) as global memory allocator
- `tcmalloc` - Uses [TCMalloc](https://google.github.io/tcmalloc/overview.html) as global memory allocator. It tries to link system-wide tcmalloc by default, use vendored from source with `tcmalloc-vendored`.
- `snmalloc` - Uses [snmalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/snmalloc) as global memory allocator
- `rpmalloc` - Uses [rpmalloc](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc) as global memory allocator

### **crates.io**

Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/shadowsocks-rust):

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install shadowsocks-rust
```

then you can find `sslocal` and `ssserver` in `$CARGO_HOME/bin`.

### **Install using Homebrew**

For macOS and Linux, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install shadowsocks-rust
```

### **Install using snap**

```bash
# Install from snapstore
snap install shadowsocks-rust

# List services
snap services shadowsocks-rust

# Enable and start shadowsocks-rust.sslocal-daemon snap service
snap start --enable shadowsocks-rust.sslocal-daemon

# Show generated systemd service status
systemctl status snap.shadowsocks-rust.sslocal-daemon.service

# Override generated systemd service (configure startup options)
systemctl edit snap.shadowsocks-rust.sslocal-daemon.service

## NOTE: you can pass args to sslocal:
##  [Service]
##  ExecStart=
##  ExecStart=/usr/bin/snap run shadowsocks-rust.sslocal-daemon -b &quot;127.0.0.1:1080&quot; --server-url &quot;ss://....&quot;

# Restart generated systemd service to apply changes
systemctl restart snap.shadowsocks-rust.sslocal-daemon.service

# ... and show service status
systemctl status snap.shadowsocks-rust.sslocal-daemon.service
```

Default configuration file path probably is `/var/snap/shadowsocks-rust/common/etc/shadowsocks-rust/config.json`.

### **Download release**

Download static-linked build [here](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/releases).

- Most of them are built with [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross). Build environment details could be found in its README, such as glibc&#039;s version.
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin` are built in github&#039;s `macos-latest` image. Information could be found in [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).
- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is built in github&#039;s `windows-latest` image. Information could be found in [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

### **Docker**

This project provided Docker images for the `linux/i386` and `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64/v8` architectures.

&gt; :warning: **Docker containers do not have access to IPv6 by default**: Make sure to disable IPv6 Route in the client or [enable IPv6 access to docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/#use-ipv6-for-the-default-bridge-network).

#### Pull from GitHub Container Registry

Docker will pull the image of the appropriate architecture from our [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/shadowsocks/packages?repo_name=shadowsocks-rust).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/shadowsocks/sslocal-rust:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/shadowsocks/ssserver-rust:latest
```

#### Build on the local machine（Optional）

If you want to build the Docker image yourself, you need to use the [BuildX](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/).

```bash
docker buildx build -t shadowsocks/ssserver-rust:latest -t shadowsocks/ssserver-rust:v1.15.2 --target ssserver .
docker buildx build -t shadowsocks/sslocal-rust:latest -t shadowsocks/sslocal-rust:v1.15.2 --target sslocal .
```

#### Run the container

You need to mount the configuration file into the container and create an external port map for the container to connect to it.

```bash
docker run --name sslocal-rust \
  --restart always \
  -p 1080:1080/tcp \
  -v /path/to/config.json:/etc/shadowsocks-rust/config.json \
  -dit ghcr.io/shadowsocks/sslocal-rust:latest

docker run --name ssserver-rust \
  --restart always \
  -p 8388:8388/tcp \
  -p 8388:8388/udp \
  -v /path/to/config.json:/etc/shadowsocks-rust/config.json \
  -dit ghcr.io/shadowsocks/ssserver-rust:latest
```

### **Deploy to Kubernetes**

This project provided yaml manifests for deploying to Kubernetes.

You can leverage k8s Service to expose traffic outside, like LoadBalancer or NodePort which gains more fine-grained compared with fixed host or port.

For a more interesting use case, you can use a Ingress(Istio, nginx, etc.) which routes the matched traffic to shadowsocks along with the real web service.

#### Using `kubectl`

`kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/raw/master/k8s/shadowsocks-rust.yaml`

You can change the config via editing the ConfigMap named `shadowsocks-rust`.

For more fine-grained control, use `helm`.

#### Using `helm`

`helm install my-release k8s/chart -f my-values.yaml`

Below is the common default values you can change:

```yaml
# This is the shadowsocks config which will be mount to /etc/shadowocks-rust.
# You can put arbitrary yaml here, and it will be translated to json before mounting.
servers:
- server: &quot;::&quot;
  server_port: 8388
  service_port: 80 # the k8s service port, default to server_port
  password: mypassword
  method: aes-256-gcm
  fast_open: true
  mode: tcp_and_udp
  # plugin: v2ray-plugin
  # plugin_opts: server;tls;host=github.com

# Whether to download v2ray and xray plugin.
downloadPlugins: false

# Name of the ConfigMap with config.json configuration for shadowsocks-rust.
configMapName: &quot;&quot;

service:
  # Change to LoadBalancer if you are behind a cloud provider like aws, gce, or tke.
  type: ClusterIP

# Bind shadowsocks port port to host, i.e., we can use host:port to access shawdowsocks server.
hostPort: false

replicaCount: 1

image:
  repository: ghcr.io/shadowsocks/ssserver-rust
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  # Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion.
  tag: &quot;latest&quot;
```

### **Build from source**

Use cargo to build. NOTE: **RAM &gt;= 2GiB**

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Then `sslocal` and `ssserver` will appear in `./target/(debug|release)/`, it works similarly as the two binaries in the official ShadowSocks&#039; implementation.

```bash
make install TARGET=release
```

Then `sslocal`, `ssserver`, `ssmanager` and `ssurl` will be installed to `/usr/local/bin` (variable PREFIX).

For Windows users, if you have encountered any problem in building, check and discuss in [#102](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/102).

### **target-cpu optimization**

If you are building for your current CPU platform (for example, build and run on your personal computer), it is recommended to set `target-cpu=native` feature to let `rustc` generate and optimize code for the CPU running the compiler.

```bash
export RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C target-cpu=native&quot;
```

### **Build standalone binaries**

Requirements:

- Docker

```bash
./build/build-release
```

Then `sslocal`, `ssserver`, `ssmanager`, `ssservice` and `ssurl` will be packaged in

- `./build/shadowsocks-${VERSION}-stable.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.xz`
- `./build/shadowsocks-${VERSION}-stable.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip`

Read `Cargo.toml` for more details.

For Linux with low GLIBC versions, set `CROSS_CONFIG` to CentOS based image:

```bash
export CROSS_CONFIG=Cross-centos.toml
```

## Getting Started

Generate a safe and secured password for a specific encryption method (`aes-128-gcm` in the example) with:

```bash
ssservice genkey -m &quot;aes-128-gcm&quot;
```

Create a ShadowSocks&#039; configuration file. Example

```jsonc
{
    &quot;server&quot;: &quot;my_server_ip&quot;,
    &quot;server_port&quot;: 8388,
    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;rwQc8qPXVsRpGx3uW+Y3Lj4Y42yF9Bs0xg1pmx8/+bo=&quot;,
    &quot;method&quot;: &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot;,
    // ONLY FOR `sslocal`
    // Delete these lines if you are running `ssserver` or `ssmanager`
    &quot;local_address&quot;: &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,
    &quot;local_port&quot;: 1080
}
```

Detailed explanation of the configuration file could be found in [shadowsocks&#039; documentation](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki). (Link to original project, not maintained anymore !)

&gt; :warning: For snap installations, configuration file is most probably located in `/var/snap/shadowsocks-rust/common/etc/shadowsocks-rust/config.json` (see &lt;https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/621&gt; / &lt;https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/1146&gt;)

In shadowsocks-rust, we also have an extended configuration file format, which is able to define more than one server. You can also disable individual servers.

```jsonc
{
    &quot;servers&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;server&quot;: &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,
            &quot;server_port&quot;: 8388,
            &quot;password&quot;: &quot;rwQc8qPXVsRpGx3uW+Y3Lj4Y42yF9Bs0xg1pmx8/+bo=&quot;,
            &quot;method&quot;: &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot;,
            &quot;timeout&quot;: 7200
        },
        {
            &quot;server&quot;: &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,
            &quot;server_port&quot;: 8389,
            &quot;password&quot;: &quot;/dliNXn5V4jg6vBW4MnC1I8Jljg9x7vSihmk6UZpRBM=&quot;,
            &quot;method&quot;: &quot;chacha20-ietf-poly1305&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;disabled&quot;: true,
            &quot;server&quot;: &quot;eg.disable.me&quot;,
            &quot;server_port&quot;: 8390,
            &quot;password&quot;: &quot;mGvbWWay8ueP9IHnV5F1uWGN2BRToiVCAWJmWOTLU24=&quot;,
            &quot;method&quot;: &quot;chacha20-ietf-poly1305&quot;
        }
    ],
    // ONLY FOR `sslocal`
    // Delete these lines if you are running `ssserver` or `ssmanager`
    &quot;local_port&quot;: 1080,
    &quot;local_address&quot;: &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
}
```

`sslocal` automatically selects the best server with the lowest latency and the highest availability.

Start Shadowsocks client and server with:

```bash
sslocal -c config.json
ssserver -c config.json
```

If you Build it with Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --bin sslocal -- -c config.json
cargo run --bin ssserver -- -c config.json
```

List all available arguments with `-h`.

## Usage

Start local client with configuration file

```bash
# Read local client configuration from file
sslocal -c /path/to/shadowsocks.json
```

### Socks5 Local client

```bash
# Pass all parameters via command line
sslocal -b &quot;127.0.0.1:1080&quot; -s &quot;[::1]:8388&quot; -m &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot; -k &quot;hello-kitty&quot; --plugin &quot;v2ray-plugin&quot; --plugin-opts &quot;server;tls;host=github.com&quot;

# Pass server with SIP002 URL
sslocal -b &quot;127.0.0.1:1080&quot; --server-url &quot;ss://YWVzLTI1Ni1nY206cGFzc3dvcmQ@127.0.0.1:8388/?plugin=v2ray-plugin%3Bserver%3Btls%3Bhost%3Dgithub.com&quot;
```

### HTTP Local client

```bash
sslocal -b &quot;127.0.0.1:3128&quot; --protocol http -s &quot;[::1]:8388&quot; -m &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot; -k &quot;hello-kitty&quot;
```

All parameters are the same as Socks5 client, except `--protocol http`.

### Tunnel Local client

```bash
# Set 127.0.0.1:8080 as the target for forwarding to
sslocal --protocol tunnel -b &quot;127.0.0.1:3128&quot; -f &quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot; -s &quot;[::1]:8388&quot; -m &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot; -k &quot;hello-kitty&quot;
```

- `--protocol tunnel` enables local client Tunnel mode
- `-f &quot;127.0.0.1:8080` sets the tunnel target address

### Transparent Proxy Local client

**NOTE**: It currently only supports

- Linux (with `iptables` targets `REDIRECT` and `TPROXY`)
- BSDs (with `pf`), such as OS X 10.10+, FreeBSD, ...

```bash
sslocal -b &quot;127.0.0.1:60080&quot; --protocol redir -s &quot;[::1]:8388&quot; -m &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot; -k &quot;hello-kitty&quot; --tcp-redir &quot;redirect&quot; --udp-redir &quot;tproxy&quot;
```

Redirects connections with `iptables` configurations to the port that `sslocal` is listening on.

- `--protocol redir` enables local client Redir mode
- (optional) `--tcp-redir` sets TCP mode to `REDIRECT` (Linux)
- (optional) `--udp-redir` sets UDP mode to `TPROXY` (Linux)

### Tun interface client

**NOTE**: It currently only supports

- Linux, Android
- macOS, iOS
- Windows

#### Linux

Create a Tun interface with name `tun0`

```bash
ip tuntap add mode tun tun0
ifconfig tun0 inet 10.255.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

Start `sslocal` with `--protocol tun` and binds to `tun0`

```bash
sslocal --protocol tun -s &quot;[::1]:8388&quot; -m &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot; -k &quot;hello-kitty&quot; --outbound-bind-interface lo0 --tun-interface-name tun0
```

#### macOS

```bash
sslocal --protocol tun -s &quot;[::1]:8388&quot; -m &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot; -k &quot;hello-kitty&quot; --outbound-bind-interface lo0 --tun-interface-address 10.255.0.1/24
```

It will create a Tun interface with address `10.255.0.1` and netmask `255.255.255.0`.

#### Windows

Download `wintun.dll` from [Wintun](https://www.wintun.net/), and place it in the folder with shadowsocks&#039; runnable binaries, or in the system PATH.

```powershell
sslocal --protocol tun -s &quot;[::1]:8388&quot; -m &quot;aes-256-gcm&quot; -k &quot;hello-kitty&quot; --outbound-bind-interface &quot;Ethernet 0&quot; --tun-interface-name &quot;shadowsocks&quot;
```

### Local client for Windows Service

Compile it by enabling `--features &quot;winservice&quot;` (not included in the default build):

```bash
cargo build --release --bin &quot;sswinservice&quot; --features &quot;winservice&quot;
```

Install it as a Windows Service (PowerShell):

```powershell
New-Service -Name &quot;shadowsocks-local-service&quot; `
            -DisplayName &quot;Shadowsocks Local Service&quot; `
            -BinaryPathName &quot;&lt;Path\to&gt;\sswinservice.exe local -c &lt;Path\to&gt;\local_config.json&quot;
```

There are other ways to install `sswinservice` as a Windows Service, for example, the `sc` command.

As you may have noticed that the `-BinaryPathName` contains not only just the `sswinservice.exe`, but `local -c local_config.json`. These command line parameters will be used as the default parameter when the Windows Service starts. You can also start the service with customized parameters.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># probe-rs

a modern, embedded debugging toolkit,
written in Rust

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/probe-rs)](https://crates.io/crates/probe-rs) [![documentation](https://docs.rs/probe-rs/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/probe-rs) [![Actions Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/probe-rs/probe-rs/ci.yml?branch=master)](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/actions) [![chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-probe--rs%3Amatrix.org-brightgreen)](https://matrix.to/#/#probe-rs:matrix.org) ![GitHub Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/github/sponsors/probe-rs)

The goal of this library is to provide a toolkit to interact with a variety of embedded MCUs and debug probes and provides a direct interface to the debug probe,
which then enables other software to use its debug functionality.

Additionally the project offers a variety of tools to be used directly for flashing and debugging, such as cargo extensions, a VS Code extension, a GDB server and a standalone CLI.

## Functionality

As of version 0.27.0 this library can:

- Connect to a DAPLink, STLink, JLink, FTDI probes, ESP32 devices with USB JTAG, WLink and the Blackmagic probe.
- Talk to ARM, Risc-V and Xtensa cores via SWD or JTAG.
- Read and write arbitrary memory of the target.
- Halt, run, step and step any core, operate breakpoints, enable trace functionality and much more.
- Download ELF, BIN and IHEX binaries using standard CMSIS-Pack flash algorithms.
- Debug a target via the CLI, VSCode (MS-DAP) and GDB.

To see what new functionality gets added every release, have a look at the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Support

If you think probe-rs makes your embedded journey more enjoyable or even earns you money, please consider supporting the project on [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/probe-rs/) for better support and more features.

## Tools

In addition to being a library, probe-rs also includes a suite of tools which can be used for flashing and debugging.

### Installation

The recommended way to install the tools is to download a precompiled version, using one of the methods below.
See &lt;https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/installation&gt; for a more detailed guide.

### cargo-flash

The `cargo-flash` utility can be used as a cargo subcommand to download a compiled Rust program onto a target device. It can also be used to download arbitrary ELF files that might come out of a C/C++ compiler. Have a look at [cargo-flash](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/cargo-flash) for more information.

### cargo-embed

If you are looking for a more extended debugging experience, please have a look at [cargo-embed](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/cargo-embed) which provides support for GDB, RTT, and config files.

### Editors and IDEs

We have implemented the [Microsoft Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/). This makes embedded debugging via probe-rs available in modern code editors implementing the standard, such as VSCode. The DAP website includes [a list of editors and IDEs which support DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/tools/).

#### VSCode

The probe-rs website includes [VSCode configuration instructions](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/debugger).

## Usage Examples

### Halting the attached chip

```rust,no_run
use probe_rs::probe::{list::Lister, Probe};
use probe_rs::Permissions;

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), probe_rs::Error&gt; {
    // Get a list of all available debug probes.
    let lister = Lister::new();

    let probes = lister.list_all();

    // Use the first probe found.
    let mut probe = probes[0].open()?;

    // Attach to a chip.
    let mut session = probe.attach(&quot;nRF52840_xxAA&quot;, Permissions::default())?;

    // Select a core.
    let mut core = session.core(0)?;

    // Halt the attached core.
    core.halt(std::time::Duration::from_millis(10))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Reading from RAM

```rust,no_run
use probe_rs::{MemoryInterface, Permissions, Session, SessionConfig};
use probe_rs::probe::WireProtocol;

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), probe_rs::Error&gt; {
    // Attach to a chip.
    let speed = Some(5500);
    let protocol = Some(WireProtocol::Swd);
    let session_config = SessionConfig {
      speed,
      protocol,
      ..Default::default()
    };

    let mut session = Session::auto_attach(&quot;nRF52840_xxAA&quot;, session_config)?;

    // Select a core.
    let mut core = session.core(0)?;

    // Read a block of 50 32 bit words.
    let mut buff = [0u32; 50];
    core.read_32(0x2000_0000, &amp;mut buff)?;

    // Read a single 32 bit word.
    let word = core.read_word_32(0x2000_0000)?;

    // Writing is just as simple.
    let buff = [0u32; 50];
    core.write_32(0x2000_0000, &amp;buff)?;

    // of course we can also write 8bit words.
    let buff = [0u8; 50];
    core.write_8(0x2000_0000, &amp;buff)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## FAQ

### I need help!

Don&#039;t hesitate to [file an issue](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/issues/new), ask questions on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#probe-rs:matrix.org), or contact [@Yatekii](https://github.com/Yatekii) via e-mail.

There is also a [troubleshooting section](https://probe.rs/docs/knowledge-base/troubleshooting) on the [project page](https://probe.rs/).

### How can I help?

Please have a look at the issues or open one if you feel that something is needed.

Any contributions are very welcome!

Also have a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Our company needs feature X and would pay for its development

Please reach out to [@Yatekii](https://github.com/Yatekii)

### Building

Building requires Rust and Cargo which can be installed [using rustup](https://rustup.rs/). 

### Adding Targets

Target files are generated using [target-gen](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/tree/master/target-gen) from CMSIS packs provided [here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/cmsis/cmsis-search).
Generated files are then placed in `probe-rs/targets` for inclusion in the probe-rs project.

### Updating STM32 targets

STM32 memory region data has been proven unreliable on multiple occasions. We now rely on [stm32-data](https://github.com/embassy-rs/stm32-data/tree/main) for the correct values. Use target-gen to update the list of devices and their flash algorithms, then use the https://github.com/bugadani/stm-probers tool to regenerate memory maps for all STM32 devices.

### Writing new flash algorithms

If there is no CMSIS-Pack with a flash algorithm available, it is necessary to write a target definition and a flash algorithm by oneself.
You can use our [template](https://github.com/probe-rs/flash-algorithm-template) for writing an algorithm. Please follow the instructions in the `README.md` in that repo.

## Acknowledgements

In early stages of this library, we profited invaluably from the pyOCD code to understand how flashing works. Also it&#039;s always a good reference to cross check how ARM specific things work. So, a big thank you to the team behind pyOCD!

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ — the state of your application
* __Messages__ — user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ — a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ — a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

Harper is an English grammar checker designed to be _just right._
I created it after years of dealing with the shortcomings of the competition.

Grammarly was too expensive and too overbearing.
Its suggestions lacked context, and were often just plain _wrong_.
Not to mention: it&#039;s a privacy nightmare.
Everything you write with Grammarly is sent to their servers.
Their privacy policy claims they don&#039;t sell the data, but that doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t use it to train large language models and god knows what else.
Not only that, but the round-trip-time of the network request makes revising your work all the more tedious.

LanguageTool is great, if you have gigabytes of RAM to spare and are willing to download the ~16GB n-gram dataset.
Besides the memory requirements, I found LanguageTool too slow: it would take several seconds to lint even a moderate-size document.

That&#039;s why I created Harper: it is the grammar checker that fits my needs.
Not only does it take milliseconds to lint a document, take less than 1/50th of LanguageTool&#039;s memory footprint,
but it is also completely private.

Harper is even small enough to load via [WebAssembly.](https://writewithharper.com)

## Language Support

Harper currently only supports English, but the core is extensible to support other languages, so we welcome contributions that allow for other language support.

## Performance Issues

We consider long lint times bugs.
If you encounter any significant performance issues, please create an issue on the topic.

If you find a fix to any performance issue, we would appreciate the contribution.
Just please make sure to read [our contribution guidelines first.](https://github.com/automattic/harper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

# This project NEEDS your help. Please consider donating on [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/Fredolx), [Paypal](https://paypal.me/fredolx) or directly by [crypto](#donate-crypto-thank-you)
I&#039;ve been developing and maintaining this project alone and for entirely for free over the past 2 years. I am in dire need of support to continue developing this project. I&#039;ve never added annoying donation pop-ups or anything of the sort to make sure you have the fastest and cleanest IPTV experience and I&#039;m committed to keep this project FREE &amp; OPEN-SOURCE. To keep that commitment, I need your support!

![Image of the app](https://github.com/Fredolx/open-tv/blob/main/screenshots/demo1.png)

## Features:
- Import your IPTV channels from any source (M3U File, M3U link, Xtream) 🗃️
- Record while watching 🎥
- Multi IPTV sources 🎊
- Control the UI from a TV remote 📺
- Super low RAM usage, crazy speeds, and instant search 🚅
- Refresh your sources when you need it 🔄
- Add channels to favorites 🌟
- Make your own custom channels
- Share your custom channels with friends
- Re-stream channels to friends or other devices (phone, tv)

## Prerequisites
If you are on Windows or use the flatpak on Linux; SKIP THIS PART. 

The app depends on mpv, ffmpeg and yt-dlp. 
If you are on MacOS, you must use Brew or MacPorts to install those dependencies. 

On Fedora, you must add rpmfusion to install those packages.

On Debian or LTS distro, I would strongly suggest using a backport for yt-dlp.

The Windows build **comes with mpv included** (.msi), but you can still install mpv from a package manager of your choice to always have the latest version installed

```
brew install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #MacOS
sudo dnf install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Fedora
sudo zypper install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #OpenSUSE
sudo pacman -Syu mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Arch
sudo apt install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Debian/Ubuntu
scoop install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp # Windows
choco install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp # Windows alternative
```

## Docker
You can install Fred TV using Docker. It wouldn&#039;t necessarily be the recommended way to install it, but it&#039;s now possible.
You should always install Fred TV from either Releases or Flatpak on Linux.

For Nvidia GPUs:
```
docker run --rm -it \
  --net=host \
  --env=&quot;DISPLAY&quot; \
  --volume=&quot;/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw&quot; \
  --volume=&quot;$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw&quot; \
  --volume=&quot;$HOME/.local/share/open-tv:/root/.local/share/open-tv&quot; \
  --gpus all \
  ghcr.io/fredolx/open-tv:latest
```
For everyone else (Intel, AMD):
```
docker run --rm -it \
  --net=host \
  --env=&quot;DISPLAY&quot; \
  --volume=&quot;/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw&quot; \
  --volume=&quot;$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw&quot; \
  --volume=&quot;$HOME/.local/share/open-tv:/root/.local/share/open-tv&quot; \
  --device /dev/dri \
  ghcr.io/fredolx/open-tv:latest
```

If you have a tv remote or air mouse that has slightly different bindings for general nav (back, up, down, left, right),
please open an issue and I will add them if it&#039;s feasible. Otherwise, you can still use hwdb to make them match Fred TV&#039;s bindings.

## Settings explained

**Stream Caching**

Why enabling:
  - If you have a slow internet connection/IPTV provider causing the stream to pause often

Why disabling: 
  - If the stream often drops completely. It will prevent the stream from jumping too far ahead/behind
  - If you have a good internet/provider and want lower latency
  - Can prevent some weird bugs/slowdowns

A secure, stable and high-performance reverse proxy for NAT traversal, written in Rust

rathole, like [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) and [ngrok](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok), can help to expose the service on the device behind the NAT to the Internet, via a server with a public IP.

&lt;!-- /TOC --&gt;

## Features

- **High Performance** Much higher throughput can be achieved than frp, and more stable when handling a large volume of connections. See [Benchmark](#benchmark)
- **Low Resource Consumption** Consumes much fewer memory than similar tools. See [Benchmark](#benchmark). [The binary can be](docs/build-guide.md) **as small as ~500KiB** to fit the constraints of devices, like embedded devices as routers.
- **Security** Tokens of services are mandatory and service-wise. The server and clients are responsible for their own configs. With the optional Noise Protocol, encryption can be configured at ease. No need to create a self-signed certificate! TLS is also supported.
- **Hot Reload** Services can be added or removed dynamically by hot-reloading the configuration file. HTTP API is WIP.

## Quickstart

A full-powered `rathole` can be obtained from the [release](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/releases) page. Or [build from source](docs/build-guide.md) **for other platforms and minimizing the binary**. A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapiz1/rathole) is also available.

The usage of `rathole` is very similar to frp. If you have experience with the latter, then the configuration is very easy for you. The only difference is that configuration of a service is split into the client side and the server side, and a token is mandatory.

To use `rathole`, you need a server with a public IP, and a device behind the NAT, where some services that need to be exposed to the Internet.

Assuming you have a NAS at home behind the NAT, and want to expose its ssh service to the Internet:

1. On the server which has a public IP

Create `server.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# server.toml
[server]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:2333&quot; # `2333` specifies the port that rathole listens for clients

[server.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Token that is used to authenticate the client for the service. Change to an arbitrary value.
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:5202&quot; # `5202` specifies the port that exposes `my_nas_ssh` to the Internet
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole server.toml
```

2. On the host which is behind the NAT (your NAS)

Create `client.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# client.toml
[client]
remote_addr = &quot;myserver.com:2333&quot; # The address of the server. The port must be the same with the port in `server.bind_addr`

[client.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Must be the same with the server to pass the validation
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:22&quot; # The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole client.toml
```

3. Now the client will try to connect to the server `myserver.com` on port `2333`, and any traffic to `myserver.com:5202` will be forwarded to the client&#039;s port `22`.

So you can `ssh myserver.com:5202` to ssh to your NAS.

To run `rathole` run as a background service on Linux, checkout the [systemd examples](./examples/systemd).

## Configuration

`rathole` can automatically determine to run in the server mode or the client mode, according to the content of the configuration file, if only one of `[server]` and `[client]` block is present, like the example in [Quickstart](#quickstart).

But the `[client]` and `[server]` block can also be put in one file. Then on the server side, run `rathole --server config.toml` and on the client side, run `rathole --client config.toml` to explicitly tell `rathole` the running mode.

Before heading to the full configuration specification, it&#039;s recommend to skim [the configuration examples](./examples) to get a feeling of the configuration format.

See [Transport](./docs/transport.md) for more details about encryption and the `transport` block.

Here is the full configuration specification:

```toml

retry_interval = 1 # Optional. The interval between retry to connect to the server. Default: 1 second

[client.transport] # The whole block is optional. Specify which transport to use
type = &quot;tcp&quot; # Optional. Possible values: [&quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;tls&quot;, &quot;noise&quot;]. Default: &quot;tcp&quot;

local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:1081&quot; # Necessary. The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
nodelay = true # Optional. Override the `client.transport.nodelay` per service
retry_interval = 1 # Optional. The interval between retry to connect to the server. Default: inherits the global config

[client.services.service2] # Multiple services can be defined
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:1082&quot;

[server]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:2333&quot; # Necessary. The address that the server listens for clients. Generally only the port needs to be change.
default_token = &quot;default_token_if_not_specify&quot; # Optional
heartbeat_interval = 30 # Optional. The interval between two application-layer heartbeat. Set to 0 to disable sending heartbeat. Default: 30 seconds

[server.transport] # Same as `[client.transport]`

nodelay = true
keepalive_secs = 20
keepalive_interval = 8

[server.transport.tls] # Necessary if `type` is &quot;tls&quot;
pkcs12 = &quot;identify.pfx&quot; # Necessary. pkcs12 file of server&#039;s certificate and private key
pkcs12_password = &quot;password&quot; # Necessary. Password of the pkcs12 file

pattern = &quot;Noise_NK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s&quot;
local_private_key = &quot;key_encoded_in_base64&quot;
remote_public_key = &quot;key_encoded_in_base64&quot;

[server.transport.websocket] # Necessary if `type` is &quot;websocket&quot;
tls = true # If `true` then it will use settings in `server.transport.tls`

[server.services.service1] # The service name must be identical to the client side

bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:8081&quot; # Necessary. The address of the service is exposed at. Generally only the port needs to be change.
nodelay = true # Optional. Same as the client

[server.services.service2]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.1:8082&quot;
```

### Logging

`rathole`, like many other Rust programs, use environment variables to control the logging level. `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, `trace` are available.

```shell
RUST_LOG=error ./rathole config.toml
```

will run `rathole` with only error level logging.

If `RUST_LOG` is not present, the default logging level is `info`.

### Tuning

From v0.4.7, rathole enables TCP_NODELAY by default, which should benefit the latency and interactive applications like rdp, Minecraft servers. However, it slightly decreases the bandwidth.

If the bandwidth is more important, TCP_NODELAY can be opted out with `nodelay = false`.

## Benchmark

rathole has similar latency to [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), but can handle a more connections, provide larger bandwidth, with less memory usage.

For more details, see the separate page [Benchmark](./docs/benchmark.md).

**However, don&#039;t take it from here that `rathole` can magically make your forwarded service faster several times than before.** The benchmark is done on local loopback, indicating the performance when the task is cpu-bounded. One can gain quite a improvement if the network is not the bottleneck. Unfortunately, that&#039;s not true for many users. In that case, the main benefit is lower resource consumption, while the bandwidth and the latency may not improved significantly.

## Roadmap

Stalwart has reached an exciting point in its journey, it’s now **feature complete**. All the core functionality and open standard email and collaboration protocols that we set out to support are in place. In other words, Stalwart already does everything you’d expect from a modern, standards-compliant mail and collaboration platform.

The next major milestone is all about refinement: finalizing the database schema and focusing on performance optimizations to ensure everything runs as efficiently and reliably as possible. Once that’s done, we’ll be ready to roll out version **1.0**.

Of course, development doesn’t stop there. The community has contributed hundreds of great ideas for improvements and new features, everything from subtle usability tweaks to entirely new integrations. You can see the full list of proposals over on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Aenhancement). If there’s something you’d like to see prioritized, just give it a thumbs up as we plan to implement enhancements based on the community’s votes.
