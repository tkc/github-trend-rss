&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the above snippet into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. It’s based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

## Docs

The official docs are hosted [here][docs]. Each individual component also has accompanying developer documentation for contributors, which you can find in each `README.md`.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyperlight is a lightweight Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) designed to be embedded within applications. It enables safe execution of untrusted code within &lt;i&gt;micro virtual machines&lt;/i&gt; with very low latency and minimal overhead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; Note: Hyperlight is a nascent project with an evolving API and no guaranteed support. Assistance is provided on a
&gt; best-effort basis by the developers.

## Overview

Hyperlight is a library for creating _micro virtual machines_  — or _sandboxes_ — specifically optimized for securely
running untrusted code with minimal impact. It supports both Windows and Linux,
utilizing [Windows Hypervisor Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/api/#windows-hypervisor-platform)
on Windows, and either Microsoft Hypervisor (mshv) or [KVM](https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) on Linux.

These micro VMs operate without a kernel or operating system, keeping overhead low. Instead, guests are built
specifically for Hyperlight using the Hyperlight Guest library, which provides a controlled set of APIs that facilitate
interaction between host and guest:

- The host can call functions implemented and exposed by the guest (known as _guest functions_).
- Once running, the guest can call functions implemented and exposed by the host (known as _host functions_).

By default, Hyperlight restricts guest access to a minimal API. The only _host function_ available by default allows the
guest to print messages, which are displayed on the host console or redirected to stdout, as configured. Hosts can
choose to expose additional host functions, expanding the guest’s capabilities as needed.

Below is an example demonstrating the use of the Hyperlight host library in Rust to execute a simple guest application
and an example of a simple guest application using the Hyperlight guest library in also written in Rust.

### Host

```rust
use std::{thread, sync::{Arc, Mutex}};

use hyperlight_common::flatbuffer_wrappers::function_types::{ParameterValue, ReturnType};
use hyperlight_host::{UninitializedSandbox, MultiUseSandbox, func::HostFunction0, sandbox_state::transition::Noop, sandbox_state::sandbox::EvolvableSandbox};

fn main() -&gt; hyperlight_host::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // Create an uninitialized sandbox with a guest binary
    let mut uninitialized_sandbox = UninitializedSandbox::new(
        hyperlight_host::GuestBinary::FilePath(hyperlight_testing::simple_guest_as_string().unwrap()),
        None, // default configuration
        None, // default run options
        None, // default host print function
    )?;

    // Register a host function
    fn sleep_5_secs() -&gt; hyperlight_host::Result&lt;()&gt; {
        thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5));
        Ok(())
    }

    let host_function = Arc::new(Mutex::new(sleep_5_secs));

    // Registering a host function makes it available to be called by the guest
    host_function.register(&amp;mut uninitialized_sandbox, &quot;Sleep5Secs&quot;)?;
    // Note: This function is unused by the guest code below, it&#039;s just here for demonstration purposes

    // Initialize sandbox to be able to call host functions
    let mut multi_use_sandbox: MultiUseSandbox = uninitialized_sandbox.evolve(Noop::default())?;

    // Call a function in the guest
    let message = &quot;Hello, World! I am executing inside of a VM :)\n&quot;.to_string();
    // in order to call a function it first must be defined in the guest and exposed so that 
    // the host can call it
    let result = multi_use_sandbox.call_guest_function_by_name(
        &quot;PrintOutput&quot;,
        ReturnType::Int,
        Some(vec![ParameterValue::String(message.clone())]),
    );

    assert!(result.is_ok());

    Ok(())
}
```

### Guest

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]
extern crate alloc;

use alloc::string::ToString;
use alloc::vec::Vec;
use hyperlight_common::flatbuffer_wrappers::function_call::FunctionCall;
use hyperlight_common::flatbuffer_wrappers::function_types::{
    ParameterType, ParameterValue, ReturnType,
};
use hyperlight_common::flatbuffer_wrappers::guest_error::ErrorCode;
use hyperlight_common::flatbuffer_wrappers::util::get_flatbuffer_result_from_int;

use hyperlight_guest::error::{HyperlightGuestError, Result};
use hyperlight_guest::guest_function_definition::GuestFunctionDefinition;
use hyperlight_guest::guest_function_register::register_function;
use hyperlight_guest::host_function_call::{
    call_host_function, get_host_value_return_as_int,
};

fn print_output(function_call: &amp;FunctionCall) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; {
    if let ParameterValue::String(message) = function_call.parameters.clone().unwrap()[0].clone() {
        call_host_function(
            &quot;HostPrint&quot;,
            Some(Vec::from(&amp;[ParameterValue::String(message.to_string())])),
            ReturnType::Int,
        )?;
        let result = get_host_value_return_as_int()?;
        Ok(get_flatbuffer_result_from_int(result))
    } else {
        Err(HyperlightGuestError::new(
            ErrorCode::GuestFunctionParameterTypeMismatch,
            &quot;Invalid parameters passed to simple_print_output&quot;.to_string(),
        ))
    }
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn hyperlight_main() {
    let print_output_def = GuestFunctionDefinition::new(
        &quot;PrintOutput&quot;.to_string(),
        Vec::from(&amp;[ParameterType::String]),
        ReturnType::Int,
        print_output as i64,
    );
    register_function(print_output_def);
}

#[no_mangle]
pub fn guest_dispatch_function(function_call: FunctionCall) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; {
    let function_name = function_call.function_name.clone();
    return Err(HyperlightGuestError::new(
        ErrorCode::GuestFunctionNotFound,
        function_name,
    ));
}
```

For additional examples of using the Hyperlight host Rust library, see
the [./src/hyperlight_host/examples](./src/hyperlight_host/examples) directory.

For examples of guest applications, see the [./src/tests/c_guests](./src/tests/c_guests) directory for C guests and
the [./src/tests/rust_guests](./src/tests/rust_guests) directory for Rust guests.

&gt; Note: Hyperlight guests can be written using the Hyperlight Rust or C Guest libraries.

## Repository Structure

- Hyperlight Host Libraries (i.e., the ones that create and manage the VMs)
    - [src/hyperlight_host](./src/hyperlight_host) - This is the Rust Hyperlight host library.

- Hyperlight Guest Libraries (i.e., the ones to make it easier to create guests that run inside the VMs)
    - [src/hyperlight_guest](./src/hyperlight_guest) - This is the Rust Hyperlight guest library.
    - [src/hyperlight_guest_capi](./src/hyperlight_guest_capi) - This is the C compatible wrapper for the Hyperlight
      guest library.

      in Rust, which are intended to be launched within partitions as &quot;guests&quot;.
    - [src/tests/c_guests](./src/tests/c_guests) - This directory contains two Hyperlight Guest programs written in C,
      which are intended to be launched within partitions as &quot;guests&quot;.

- Tests:
    - [src/hyperlight-testing](./src/hyperlight_testing) - Shared testing code for Hyperlight projects built in Rust.

## Try it yourself!

You can run Hyperlight on:

- [Linux with KVM][kvm].
- [Windows with Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHP).][whp] -  Note that you need Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022 or later to use hyperlight, if you are running on earlier versions of Windows then you should consider using our devcontainer on [GitHub codespaces]((https://codespaces.new/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight)) or WSL2.
- Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (see instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for Windows client and [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-on-server) for Windows Server) with KVM.
- Azure Linux with mshv (note that you need mshv to be installed to use Hyperlight)

After having an environment with a hypervisor setup, running the example has the following pre-requisites:

1. On Linux or WSL, you&#039;ll most likely need build essential. For Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install build-essential`. For
   Azure Linux, run `sudo dnf install build-essential`.
2. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Install toolchain v1.81 or later.

   Also, install the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `x86_64-unknown-none` targets, these are needed to build the test
   guest binaries. (Note: install both targets on either Linux or Windows: Hyperlight can load ELF or PE files on either
   OS, and the tests/examples are built for both):

    ```sh
    rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none
    rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
    ```

3. [just](https://github.com/casey/just). `cargo install just` On Windows you also need [pwsh](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4).
4. [clang and LLVM](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html).
    - On Ubuntu, run:

        ```sh
        wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
        chmod +x ./llvm.sh
        sudo ./llvm.sh 17 all
        sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-17/bin/clang-cl /usr/bin/clang-cl
        sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-17/bin/llvm-lib /usr/bin/llvm-lib
        sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-17/bin/lld-link /usr/bin/lld-link
        sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-17/bin/llvm-ml /usr/bin/llvm-ml
        sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-17/bin/ld.lld /usr/bin/ld.lld
        sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-17/bin/clang /usr/bin/clang
        ```

    - On Windows, see [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild?view=msvc-170).

    - On Azure Linux, run:

        ```sh
        sudo dnf remove clang -y || true
        sudo dnf install clang17 -y
        sudo dnf install clang17-tools-extra -y
        ```

Then, we are ready to build and run the example:

```sh
just build  # build the Hyperlight library
just rg     # build the rust test guest binaries
cargo run --example hello-world
```

If all worked as expected, you should see the following message in your console:

```text
Hello, World! I am executing inside of a VM :)
```

If you get the error `Error: NoHypervisorFound` and KVM or mshv is set up then this may be a permissions issue. In bash,
you can use `ls -l /dev/kvm` or  `ls -l /dev/mshv` to check which group owns that device and then `groups` to make sure
your user is a member of that group.

For more details on how to verify that KVM is correctly installed and permissions are correct, follow the
guide [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation).

### Or you can use a codespace

## Contributing to Hyperlight

If you are interested in contributing to Hyperlight, running the entire test-suite is a good way to get started. To do
so, on your console, run the following commands:

```sh
just guests  # build the c and rust test guests
just build  # build the Hyperlight library
just test # runs the tests
```

Also , please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information on how to contribute to
Hyperlight.

&gt; Note: For general Hyperlight development, you may also need flatc (Flatbuffer compiler): for instructions,

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like `Cannot read property &#039;importKey&#039;`. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.
&gt;
&gt;This can be configured in [Vaultwarden directly](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS) or using a third-party reverse proxy ([some examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).
&gt;
&gt;If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with [Let&#039;s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Some proxies automatically do this step, like Caddy or Traefik (see examples linked above).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

The main way to use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 80:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 80:80
```

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT3` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

&lt;/picture&gt;

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Tested platforms

We test all combinations of:

| Instance       | Host OS &amp; Kernel | Guest Rootfs | Guest Kernel |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| c5n.metal      | al2 linux_5.10   | ubuntu 24.04 | linux_5.10   |
| m5n.metal      | al2023 linux_6.1 |              | linux_6.1    |
| m6i.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m6a.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m7a.metal-48xl |                  |              |              |
| m6g.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m7g.metal      |                  |              |              |

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

DataFusion is an extensible query engine written in [Rust] that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate provides libraries and binaries for developers building fast and
feature rich database and analytic systems, customized to particular workloads.
See [use cases] for examples. The following related subprojects target end users:

- [DataFusion Python](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/) offers a Python interface for SQL and DataFrame
  queries.
- [DataFusion Ray](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ray/) provides a distributed version of DataFusion that scales
  out on Ray clusters.
- [DataFusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/) is an accelerator for Apache Spark based on
  DataFusion.

&quot;Out of the box,&quot;
DataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs, excellent [performance],
built-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro, extensive customization, and
a great community.

DataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,
vectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can
customize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,
query languages, functions, custom operators and more.

## Crate features

This crate has several [features] which can be specified in your `Cargo.toml`.

[features]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html

Default features:

- `nested_expressions`: functions for working with nested type function such as `array_to_string`
- `compression`: reading files compressed with `xz2`, `bzip2`, `flate2`, and `zstd`
- `crypto_expressions`: cryptographic functions such as `md5` and `sha256`

[apache avro]: https://avro.apache.org/
[apache parquet]: https://parquet.apache.org/

## Rust Version Compatibility Policy

The Rust toolchain releases are tracked at [Rust Versions](https://releases.rs) and follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A Rust toolchain release can be identified
by a version string like `1.80.0`, or more generally `major.minor.patch`.

DataFusion&#039;s supports the last 4 stable Rust minor versions released and any such versions released within the last 4 months.

For example, given the releases `1.78.0`, `1.79.0`, `1.80.0`, `1.80.1` and `1.81.0` DataFusion will support 1.78.0, which is 3 minor versions prior to the most minor recent `1.81`.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

DataFusion enforces MSRV policy using a [MSRV CI Check](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fdatafusion+rust-version+language%3ATOML+path%3A%2F%5ECargo.toml%2F&amp;type=code)

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html
[dependabot]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it&#039;s a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB&#039;s Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git&#039;s user interface hasn&#039;t been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Main Features

- **Virtual Branches**
  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches
  - Automatically create new branches when needed
- **Easy Commit Management**
  - Undo, Amend and Squash commits by dragging and dropping
- **Undo Timeline**
  - Logs all operations and changes and allows you to easily undo or revert any operation
- **GitHub Integration**
  - Authenticate to GitHub to open Pull Requests, list branches and statuses and more
- **Easy SSH Key Management**
  - GitButler can generate an SSH key to upload to GitHub automatically
- **AI Tooling**
  - Automatically write commit messages based on your work in progress
  - Automatically create descriptive branch names
- **Commit Signing**
  - Easy commit signing with GPG or SSH

## Example Uses

### Fixing a Bug While Working on a Feature

&gt; Say that while developing a feature, you encounter a bug that you wish to fix. It&#039;s often desirable that you ship the fix as a separate contribution (Pull request).

Using Git you can stash your changes and switch to another branch, where you can commit, and push your fix.

_With GitButler_ you simply assign your fix to a separate virtual branch, which you can individually push (or directly create a PR). An additional benefit is that you can retain the fix in your working directory while waiting for CI and/or code review.

### Trying Someone Else&#039;s Branch Together With My Work in Progress

&gt; Say you want to test a branch from someone else for the purpose of code review.

Using Git trying out someone else&#039;s branch is a full context switch away from your own work.
_With GitButler_ you can apply and unapply (add / remove) any remote branch directly into your working directory.

## Documentation

You can find our end user documentation at: https://docs.gitbutler.com

## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have a bug or feature request, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/new),
or [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D).

## AI Commit Message Generation

Commit message generation is an opt-in feature. You can enable it while adding your repository for the first time or later in the project settings.

Currently, GitButler uses OpenAI&#039;s API for diff summarization, which means that if enabled, code diffs would be sent to OpenAI&#039;s servers.

Our goal is to make this feature more modular such that in the future you can modify the prompt as well as plug a different LLM endpoints (including local ones).

### Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways you can contribute to Zed.

Also... we&#039;re hiring! Check out our [jobs](https://zed.dev/jobs) page for open roles.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

TiKV is an open-source, distributed, and transactional key-value database. Unlike other traditional NoSQL systems, TiKV not only provides classical key-value APIs, but also transactional APIs with ACID compliance. Built in Rust and powered by Raft, TiKV was originally created by [PingCAP](https://en.pingcap.com) to complement [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb), a distributed HTAP database compatible with the MySQL protocol.

The design of TiKV (&#039;Ti&#039; stands for titanium) is inspired by some great distributed systems from Google, such as BigTable, Spanner, and Percolator, and some of the latest achievements in academia in recent years, such as the Raft consensus algorithm.

If you&#039;re interested in contributing to TiKV, or want to build it from source, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

TiKV is a graduated project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who&#039;s involved and how TiKV plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/09/02/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-tikv-graduation/).

---

With the implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust and consensus state stored in RocksDB, TiKV guarantees data consistency. [Placement Driver (PD)](https://github.com/pingcap/pd/), which is introduced to implement auto-sharding, enables automatic data migration. The transaction model is similar to Google&#039;s Percolator with some performance improvements. TiKV also provides snapshot isolation (SI), snapshot isolation with lock (SQL: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), and externally consistent reads and writes in distributed transactions.

TiKV has the following key features:

- **Geo-Replication**

    TiKV uses [Raft](http://raft.github.io/) and the Placement Driver to support Geo-Replication.

- **Horizontal scalability**

    With PD and carefully designed Raft groups, TiKV excels in horizontal scalability and can easily scale to 100+ TBs of data.

- **Consistent distributed transactions**

    Similar to Google&#039;s Spanner, TiKV supports externally-consistent distributed transactions.

- **Coprocessor support**

    Similar to HBase, TiKV implements a coprocessor framework to support distributed computing.

- **Cooperates with [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb)**

    Thanks to the internal optimization, TiKV and TiDB can work together to be a compelling database solution with high horizontal scalability, externally-consistent transactions, support for RDBMS, and NoSQL design patterns.

## Governance

See [Governance](https://github.com/tikv/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).

&gt; **Note:**
&gt;
&gt; We have migrated our documentation from the [TiKV&#039;s wiki page](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/wiki/) to the [official website](https://tikv.org/docs). The original Wiki page is discontinued. If you have any suggestions or issues regarding documentation, offer your feedback [here](https://github.com/tikv/website).

## TiKV adopters

## TiKV software stack

![The TiKV software stack](images/tikv_stack.png)

- **Placement Driver:** PD is the cluster manager of TiKV, which periodically checks replication constraints to balance load and data automatically.
- **Store:** There is a RocksDB within each Store and it stores data into the local disk.
- **Region:** Region is the basic unit of Key-Value data movement. Each Region is replicated to multiple Nodes. These multiple replicas form a Raft group.
- **Node:** A physical node in the cluster. Within each node, there are one or more Stores. Within each Store, there are many Regions.

When a node starts, the metadata of the Node, Store and Region are recorded into PD. The status of each Region and Store is reported to PD regularly.

## Quick start

### Deploy a playground with TiUP

The most quickest to try out TiKV with TiDB is using TiUP, a component manager for TiDB.

You can see [this page](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/quick-start-with-tidb#deploy-a-local-test-environment-using-tiup-playground) for a step by step tutorial.

### Deploy a playground with binary

TiKV is able to run separately with PD, which is the minimal deployment required.

1. Download and extract binaries.

```bash
$ export TIKV_VERSION=v7.5.0
$ export GOOS=darwin  # only {darwin, linux} are supported
$ export GOARCH=amd64 # only {amd64, arm64} are supported
$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
```

2. Start PD instance.

```bash
$ ./pd-server --name=pd --data-dir=/tmp/pd/data --client-urls=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:2379&quot; --peer-urls=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:2380&quot; --initial-cluster=&quot;pd=http://127.0.0.1:2380&quot; --log-file=/tmp/pd/log/pd.log
```

3. Start TiKV instance.

```bash
$ ./tikv-server --pd-endpoints=&quot;127.0.0.1:2379&quot; --addr=&quot;127.0.0.1:20160&quot; --data-dir=/tmp/tikv/data --log-file=/tmp/tikv/log/tikv.log
```

4. Install TiKV Client(Python) and verify the deployment, required Python 3.5+.

```bash
$ pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ tikv-client
```

```python
from tikv_client import RawClient

client = RawClient.connect(&quot;127.0.0.1:2379&quot;)

client.put(b&#039;foo&#039;, b&#039;bar&#039;)
print(client.get(b&#039;foo&#039;)) # b&#039;bar&#039;

client.put(b&#039;foo&#039;, b&#039;baz&#039;)
print(client.get(b&#039;foo&#039;)) # b&#039;baz&#039;
```

### Deploy a cluster with TiUP

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you are running these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, otherwise the application might not be able to find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

Current features:

- Viewing information about the GPU
- Power and thermals monitoring, power limit configuration
- Fan curve control (AMD and Nvidia)
- Overclocking (GPU/VRAM clockspeed and voltage)
- Power states configuration (AMD only)

All of the functionality works regardless of the desktop session (there is no
dependency on X11 extensions).

# Installation

- Arch Linux: Install the package from official repositories: `pacman -S lact`
  (or `lact-git` from AUR for development builds).
- Debian/Ubuntu/Derivatives: Download a .deb from
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  It is only available on Debian 12+ and Ubuntu 22.04+ as older versions don&#039;t
  ship gtk4.
- Fedora: use the
  [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ilyaz/LACT/), or
  download an RPM from
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).
- Gentoo: Available in
  [GURU](https://github.com/gentoo/guru/tree/master/sys-apps/lact).
- OpenSUSE: an RPM is available in
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  Only tumbleweed is supported as leap does not have the required dependencies
  in the repos.
- NixOS: There is a package available in
  [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=24.05&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=packages&amp;query=lact)
- Flatpak (universal): Available in [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/) (not yet published on Flathub).

  See the [Flatpak documentation](./flatpak/README.md) for setup notes.
- Build from source.

Note: Nvidia support requires the Nvidia proprietary driver with CUDA libraries
installed.

## Development builds

To get latest fixes or features that have not yet been released in a stable
version, there are packages built from the latest commit that you can install
from the
[test release](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/test-build)
or using the `lact-git` AUR package on Arch-based distros.

Note: the date that GitHub shows next to the test release is not when the packages were built,
the actual date is specified next to the attached package files.

# Usage

Enable and start the service (otherwise you won&#039;t be able to change any
settings):

```
sudo systemctl enable --now lactd
```

You can now use the GUI to change settings and view information.

# Hardware support

See the
[Wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Hardware-Support)

# Configuration

There is a configuration file available in `/etc/lact/config.yaml`. Most of the
settings are accessible through the GUI, but some of them may be useful to be
edited manually (like `admin_group` and `admin_user` to specify who has access
to the daemon)

See [CONFIG.md](./docs/CONFIG.md) for more information.

**Socket permissions setup:**

By default, LACT uses either ether the `wheel` or `sudo` group (whichever is
available) for the ownership of the unix socket that the GUI needs to connect
to.

On most desktop configurations (such as the default setup on Arch-based, most
Debian-based or Fedora systems) this includes the default user, so you do not
need to configure this.

However, some systems may have different user configuration. In particular, this
has been reported to be a problem on OpenSUSE.

To fix socket permissions in such configurations, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml`
and under the `daemon` section either:

- Set `admin_user` to your username
- Set `admin_group` to a group that your user is a part of Then restart the
  service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

# Overclocking (AMD)

Some functionality requires enabling an option in the amdgpu driver, see the
[wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Overclocking-(AMD)) for
more information.

## Power profiles daemon note!

If you are using `power-profiles-daemon` (which is installed by default on many
distributions), by default it will override the amdgpu performance level setting
according to its own profile.

To avoid this, create a file at
`/etc/systemd/system/power-profiles-daemon.service.d/override.conf` with the
following contents:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/power-profiles-daemon --block-action=amdgpu_dpm
```

Note: the `/usr/libexec` path might be different on your system, check it in
`systemctl status power-profiles-daemon`

See https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/issues/370 for more information.

# Suspend/Resume

As some of the GPU settings may get reset when suspending the system, LACT will
reload them on system resume. This may not work on distributions which don&#039;t use
systemd, as it relies on the `org.freedesktop.login2` DBus interface.

# Building from source

Dependencies:

- rust 1.76+
- gtk 4.6+
- git
- pkg-config
- clang
- make
- hwdata
- libdrm
- vulkan-tools

Command to install all dependencies:

- Fedora:
  `sudo dnf install rust cargo make git clang gtk4-devel libdrm-devel vulkan-tools`
- Arch:
  `sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git clang make rust gtk4 hwdata vulkan-tools`

Steps:

- `git clone https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT &amp;&amp; cd LACT`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`

It&#039;s possible to change which features LACT gets built with. To do so, replace
the `make` command with the following variation:

Headless build with no GUI:

```
make build-release-headless
```

Build GUI with libadwaita support:

```
make build-release-libadwaita
```

# Remote management

It&#039;s possible to have the LACT daemon running on one machine, and then manage it
remotely from another.

This is disabled by default, as the TCP connection **does not have any
authentication or encryption mechanism!** Make sure to only use it in trusted
networks and/or set up appropriate firewall rules.

To enable it, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml` and add `tcp_listen_address` with
your desired address and in the `daemon` section.

Example:

```yaml
daemon:
  tcp_listen_address: 0.0.0.0:12853
  log_level: info
  admin_group: wheel
  disable_clocks_cleanup: false
```

After this restart the service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

To connect to a remote instance with the GUI, run it with
`lact gui --tcp-address 192.168.1.10:12853`.

# CLI

There is also a cli available.

- List system GPUs:

  `lact cli list-gpus`

  Example output:

  ```
  10DE:2704-1462:5110-0000:09:00.0 (AD103 [GeForce RTX 4080])
  ```
- Getting GPU information:

  `lact cli info`

  Example output:

  ```
  $ lact cli info
  GPU 10DE:2704-1462:5110-0000:09:00.0:
  =====================================
  GPU Model: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 (0x10DE:0x2704)
  Card Manufacturer: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd. [MSI] (0x1462)
  Card Model: Unknown (0x5110)
  Driver Used: nvidia 570.124.04
  VBIOS Version: 95.03.1E.00.60
  VRAM Size: 16376 MiB
  GPU Family: Ada
  Cuda Cores: 9728
  SM Count: 76
  ROP Count: 112 (14 * 8)
  VRAM Type: GDDR6x
  VRAM Manufacturer: Micron
  L2 Cache: 65536 KiB
  Resizeable bar: Enabled
  CPU Accessible VRAM: 16384
  Link Speed: 8 GT/s PCIe gen 3 x8
  ```

The functionality of the CLI is quite limited. If you want to integrate LACT
with some application/script, you should use the [API](API.md) instead.

# Reporting issues

When reporting issues, please include your system info and GPU model.

If you&#039;re having an issue with changing the GPU&#039;s configuration, it&#039;s highly
recommended to include a debug snapshot in the bug report. You can generate one
using the option in the dropdown menu:

![image](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/assets/22796665/36dda5e3-981b-47e7-914e-6e29f30616b4)

The snapshot is an archive which includes the SysFS that LACT uses to interact
with the GPU.

If there&#039;s a crash, run `lact gui` from the command line to get GUI logs, check
daemon logs in `journalctl -u lactd` for errors, and see `dmesg` for kernel logs
that might include information about driver and system issues.

# Other tools

Here&#039;s a list of other useful tools for AMD GPUs on Linux:

- [CoreCtrl](https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl) - direct alternative to LACT,
  provides similar functionality in addition to CPU configuration with a Qt UI
- [amdgpu_top](https://github.com/Umio-Yasuno/amdgpu_top) - tool for detailed
  real-time statistics on AMD GPUs
- [Tuxclocker](https://github.com/Lurkki14/tuxclocker) - Qt overclocking tool,
  has support for AMD GPUs

InfluxDB Core is a database built to collect, process, transform, and store event and time series data. It is ideal for use cases that require real-time ingest and fast query response times to build user interfaces, monitoring, and automation solutions.

Common use cases include:

- Monitoring sensor data
- Server monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Network monitoring
- Financial market and trading analytics
- Behavioral analytics

InfluxDB is optimized for scenarios where near real-time data monitoring is essential and queries 
need to return quickly to support user experiences such as dashboards and interactive user interfaces.

InfluxDB 3 Core’s feature highlights include:

- Diskless architecture with object storage support (or local disk with no dependencies)
- Fast query response times (under 10ms for last-value queries, or 30ms for distinct metadata)
- Embedded Python VM for plugins and triggers
- Parquet file persistence
- Compatibility with InfluxDB 1.x and 2.x write APIs
- Compatability with InfluxDB 1.x query API (InfluxQL)
- SQL query engine with support for FlightSQL and HTTP query API

## Project Status

InfluxDB 3 Core is in public beta and available for testing and feedback, but is not meant for 
production use. During the beta period we will be adding a couple of security and operational 
features to Enterprise. Otherwise, we will be focused on testing, robustness, performance, and 
operational tooling. Both the product and this documentation are works in progress. New builds get created on 
every merge into main, however we will have weekly beta builds along with a changelog for uses 
that want to move at a slower pace.

All of the APIs outside of the processing engine can be considered stable. They are what we will GA the 3.0 
version with. We will also not be making any changes to file formats that don&#039;t also come with an in-place 
upgrade path. This means that you will be able to keep the data in the database when upgrading beta versions 
and into the GA. We anticpate the general availability of InfluxDB 3 Core in April 2025.

We welcome and encourage your input about your experience with the beta. Join the [InfluxDB3 Discord](https://discord.gg/vZe2w2Ds8B)
