A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mountpoint for Amazon S3

[![Tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![Integration tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a simple, high-throughput file client for [mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/the-inside-story-on-mountpoint-for-amazon-s3-a-high-performance-open-source-file-client/). With Mountpoint for Amazon S3, your applications can access objects stored in Amazon S3 through file operations like `open` and `read`. Mountpoint for Amazon S3 automatically translates these operations into S3 object API calls, giving your applications access to the elastic storage and throughput of Amazon S3 through a file interface.

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is optimized for applications that need high read throughput to large objects, potentially from many clients at once, and to write new objects sequentially from a single client at a time. This means it&#039;s a great fit for applications that use a file interface to:
* read large objects from S3, potentially from many instances concurrently, without downloading them to local storage first
* access only some S3 objects out of a larger data set, but can&#039;t predict which objects in advance
* upload their output to S3 directly, or upload files from local storage with tools like `cp`

but probably not the right fit for applications that:
* use file operations that S3 doesn&#039;t natively support, like directory renaming or symlinks
* make edits to existing files (don&#039;t work on your Git repository or run `vim` in Mountpoint 😄)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 does not implement all the features of a POSIX file system, and there are some differences that may affect compatibility with your application. See [Mountpoint file system behavior](doc/SEMANTICS.md) for a detailed description of Mountpoint for Amazon S3&#039;s behavior and POSIX support and how they could affect your application.
To troubleshoot file operations that may not be supported by Mountpoint, see the [troubleshooting documentation](doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Current status

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is generally available! We&#039;re tracking future feature development on the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/84). We&#039;re always interested in feedback on features, performance, and compatibility. Please send feedback by [opening a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues/new/choose) or adding your input to an existing roadmap issue.

### Notices

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Mountpoint for Amazon S3 v1.4.0, released on January 26, 2024, contains an [issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/751) that causes intermittent read failures. We recommend that customers using v1.4.0 upgrade to v1.4.1 or later.

## Getting started

Run these two commands to install Mountpoint for Amazon S3 on your Amazon Linux EC2 instance (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.rpm
    sudo yum install -y ./mount-s3.rpm

On Ubuntu, use these commands instead (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.deb
    sudo apt-get install -y ./mount-s3.deb

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Installing Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions and other installation options, including the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/s3-csi.html) for Kubernetes applications, or building from source.

Once you&#039;ve got Mountpoint for Amazon S3 installed, you can mount your Amazon S3 bucket.
You&#039;ll need valid AWS credentials to access your bucket.
Mountpoint will automatically use credentials from [an IAM role associated with your EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html),
or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables,
or from [several other sources](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md#aws-credentials).

To mount your bucket, run this command,
replacing `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` with the name of your bucket
and `/path/to/mount` with the directory you want to mount the bucket to:

    mount-s3 amzn-s3-demo-bucket /path/to/mount

Now you can work with your bucket contents as if they were a local file system:

    ls /path/to/mount
    echo &quot;Hello World!&quot; &gt; /path/to/mount/Data.txt
    cat /path/to/mount/Data.txt

When you&#039;re finished accessing your bucket, you can unmount it (you might need `sudo`):

    umount /path/to/mount

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Configuring Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md) for more details on how to configure and use Mountpoint.

### Compatibility with other storage services

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is designed for high-performance access to the Amazon S3 service. While it may be functional against other storage services that use S3-like APIs, we aren&#039;t able to provide support for those use cases, and they may inadvertently break when we make changes to better support Amazon S3. We welcome contributions of minor compatibility fixes or performance improvements for these services if the changes can be tested against Amazon S3.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Mountpoint for Amazon S3! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](doc/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to report bugs or submit pull requests. We especially welcome contributions to issues tagged as [good first issues to work on](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Troubleshooting

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;See details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that may arise are likely due to your system missing dependencies
required to correctly analyze a network adapter. &lt;br&gt;
Check the [required dependencies page](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Required-dependencies) 
for instructions on how to proceed depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not updated,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may manifest bugs (the interface glitches, color gradients are unsupported, or some icons are completely black). &lt;br&gt;
In these cases you can set an environment variable to switch to the `tiny-skia` renderer,
a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment:

```sh
ICED_BACKEND=tiny-skia
```

### ***In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/new/choose), and I will do my best to help you!***

## BAML: Basically a Made-up Language
&lt;h4&gt;

[Homepage](https://www.boundaryml.com/) | [Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com) | [BAML AI Chat](https://www.boundaryml.com/chat) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/BTNBeXGuaS)



&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

BAML is a simple prompting language for building reliable **AI workflows and agents**.

BAML makes prompt engineering easy by turning it into _schema engineering_ -- where you mostly focus on the models of your prompt -- to get more reliable outputs. 
You don&#039;t need to write your whole app in BAML, only the prompts! You can wire-up your LLM Functions in any language of your choice! See our quickstarts for [Python](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/python), [TypeScript](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/typescript), [Ruby](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/ruby) and [Go, and more](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/rest-api-other-languages).

BAML comes with all batteries included -- with full typesafety, streaming, retries, wide model support, even when they don&#039;t support native [tool-calling APIs](#enable-reliable-tool-calling-with-any-model-even-when-they-dont-support-it)

**Try BAML**: [Prompt Fiddle](https://www.promptfiddle.com) • [Interactive App Examples](https://baml-examples.vercel.app/)


## The core BAML principle: LLM Prompts are functions

The fundamental building block in BAML is a function. Every prompt is a function that takes in parameters and returns a type.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; string
```

Every function additionally defines which models it uses and what its prompt is.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; StopTool | ReplyTool {
    client &quot;openai/gpt-4o-mini&quot;

    prompt #&quot;
        Be a {{ tone }} bot.

        {{ ctx.output_format }}

        {% for m in message %}
        {{ _.role(m.role) }}
        {{ m.content }}
        {% endfor %}
    &quot;#
}

class Message {
    role string
    content string
}

class ReplyTool {
  response string
}

class StopTool {
  action &quot;stop&quot; @description(#&quot;
    when it might be a good time to end the conversation
  &quot;#)
}
```

## BAML Functions can be called from any language
Below we call the ChatAgent function we defined in BAML through Python. BAML&#039;s Rust compiler generates a &quot;baml_client&quot; to access and call them.

```python
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import Message, StopTool

messages = [Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=&quot;How can I help?&quot;)]

while True:
  print(messages[-1].content)
  user_reply = input()
  messages.append(Message(role=&quot;user&quot;, content=user_reply))
  tool = b.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
  if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
    print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
    break
  else:
    messages.append(Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=tool.response))
```
You can write any kind of agent or workflow using chained BAML functions. An agent is a while loop that calls a Chat BAML Function with some state.

And if you need to stream, add a couple more lines:
```python
stream = b.stream.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
# partial is a Partial type with all Optional fields
for tool in stream:
    if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
      ...
    
final = stream.get_final_response()
```
And get fully type-safe outputs for each chunk in the stream.

## Test prompts 10x faster, right in your IDE
BAML comes with native tooling for VSCode (jetbrains + neovim coming soon). 

**Visualize full prompt (including any multi-modal assets), and the API request**. BAML gives you full transparency and control of the prompt.

![raw-curl](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b34db9-80cd-45a7-a356-6b5ab4a9c5b7)

**Using AI is all about iteration speed.**

If testing your pipeline takes 2 minutes, you can only test 10 ideas in 20 minutes.

If you reduce it to 5 seconds, you can test 240 ideas in the same amount of time.
![resume-attempt2-smaller2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc6b8a6-ffed-4cfc-80b8-78bc8a3d66a6)

The playground also allows you to run tests in parallel -- for even faster iteration speeds 🚀.

No need to login to websites, and no need to manually define json schemas.

## Enable reliable tool-calling with any model
BAML works even when the models don&#039;t support native tool-calling APIs. We created the SAP (schema-aligned parsing) algorithm to support the flexible outputs LLMs can provide, like markdown within a JSON blob or chain-of-thought prior to answering. [Read more about SAP](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsing)

With BAML, your structured outputs work in Day-1 of a model release. No need to figure out whether a model supports parallel tool calls, or whether it supports recursive schemas, or `anyOf` or `oneOf` etc.

See it in action with: **[Deepseek-R1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/deepseek-r1-function-calling)** and [OpenAI O1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/openai-o1).

## Build beautiful streaming UIs
BAML generates a ton of utilities for NextJS, Python (and any language) to make streaming UIs easy.
![recipe-generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf82495b-21fc-40bf-ae98-93eef923d620)

BAML&#039;s streaming interfaces are fully type-safe. Check out the [Streaming Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/baml-basics/streaming), and our [React hooks](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/framework-integration/react-next-js/quick-start)

## Fully Open-Source, and offline
- 100% open-source (Apache 2)
- 100% private. AGI will not require an internet connection, neither will BAML
    - No network requests beyond model calls you explicitly set
    - Not stored or used for any training data
- BAML files can be saved locally on your machine and checked into Github for easy diffs.
- Built in Rust. So fast, you can&#039;t even tell it&#039;s there.

## BAML&#039;s Design Philosophy

Everything is fair game when making new syntax. If you can code it, it can be yours. This is our design philosophy to help restrict ideas:

- **1:** Avoid invention when possible
    - Yes, prompts need versioning — we have a great versioning tool: git
    - Yes, you need to save prompts — we have a great storage tool: filesystems
- **2:** Any file editor and any terminal should be enough to use it
- **3:** Be fast
- **4:** A first year university student should be able to understand it

## Why a new programming language

We used to write websites like this:

```python
def home():
    return &quot;&lt;button onclick=\&quot;() =&gt; alert(\\\&quot;hello!\\\&quot;)\&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;&quot;
```

And now we do this:

```jsx
function Home() {
  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prev =&gt; prev + 1)}&gt;
          {count} clicks!
         &lt;/button&gt;
}
```

New syntax can be incredible at expressing new ideas. Plus the idea of maintaining hundreds of f-strings for prompts kind of disgusts us 🤮. Strings are bad for maintainable codebases. We prefer structured strings.

The goal of BAML is to give you the expressiveness of English, but the structure of code.

Full [blog post](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/ai-agents-need-new-syntax) by us.


## Conclusion

As models get better, we&#039;ll continue expecting even more out of them. But what will never change is that we&#039;ll want a way to write maintainable code that uses those models. The current way we all just assemble strings is very reminiscent of the early days PHP/HTML soup in web development. We hope some of the ideas we shared today can make a tiny dent in helping us all shape the way we all code tomorrow.

`fd` is a program to find entries in your filesystem.
It is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to [`find`](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/).
While it does not aim to support all of `find`&#039;s powerful functionality, it provides sensible
(opinionated) defaults for a majority of use cases.

[Installation](#installation) • [How to use](#how-to-use) • [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Features

* Intuitive syntax: `fd PATTERN` instead of `find -iname &#039;*PATTERN*&#039;`.
* Regular expression (default) and glob-based patterns.
* [Very fast](#benchmark) due to parallelized directory traversal.
* Uses colors to highlight different file types (same as `ls`).
* Supports [parallel command execution](#command-execution)
* Smart case: the search is case-insensitive by default. It switches to
  case-sensitive if the pattern contains an uppercase
  character[\*](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#&#039;smartcase&#039;).
* Ignores hidden directories and files, by default.
* Ignores patterns from your `.gitignore`, by default.
* The command name is *50%* shorter[\*](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) than
  `find` :-).

## How to use

First, to get an overview of all available command line options, you can either run
[`fd -h`](#command-line-options) for a concise help message or `fd --help` for a more detailed
version.

### Simple search

*fd* is designed to find entries in your filesystem. The most basic search you can perform is to
run *fd* with a single argument: the search pattern. For example, assume that you want to find an
old script of yours (the name included `netflix`):
``` bash
&gt; fd netfl
Software/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py
```
If called with just a single argument like this, *fd* searches the current directory recursively
for any entries that *contain* the pattern `netfl`.

### Regular expression search

The search pattern is treated as a regular expression. Here, we search for entries that start
with `x` and end with `rc`:
``` bash
&gt; cd /etc
&gt; fd &#039;^x.*rc$&#039;
X11/xinit/xinitrc
X11/xinit/xserverrc
```

The regular expression syntax used by `fd` is [documented here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).

### Specifying the root directory

If we want to search a specific directory, it can be given as a second argument to *fd*:
``` bash
&gt; fd passwd /etc
/etc/default/passwd
/etc/pam.d/passwd
/etc/passwd
```

### List all files, recursively

*fd* can be called with no arguments. This is very useful to get a quick overview of all entries
in the current directory, recursively (similar to `ls -R`):
``` bash
&gt; cd fd/tests
&gt; fd
testenv
testenv/mod.rs
tests.rs
```

If you want to use this functionality to list all files in a given directory, you have to use
a catch-all pattern such as `.` or `^`:
``` bash
&gt; fd . fd/tests/
testenv
testenv/mod.rs
tests.rs
```

### Searching for a particular file extension

Often, we are interested in all files of a particular type. This can be done with the `-e` (or
`--extension`) option. Here, we search for all Markdown files in the fd repository:
``` bash
&gt; cd fd
&gt; fd -e md
CONTRIBUTING.md
README.md
```

The `-e` option can be used in combination with a search pattern:
``` bash
&gt; fd -e rs mod
src/fshelper/mod.rs
src/lscolors/mod.rs
tests/testenv/mod.rs
```

### Searching for a particular file name

 To find files with exactly the provided search pattern, use the `-g` (or `--glob`) option:
``` bash
&gt; fd -g libc.so /usr
/usr/lib32/libc.so
/usr/lib/libc.so
```

### Hidden and ignored files
By default, *fd* does not search hidden directories and does not show hidden files in the
search results. To disable this behavior, we can use the `-H` (or `--hidden`) option:
``` bash
&gt; fd pre-commit
&gt; fd -H pre-commit
.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample
```

If we work in a directory that is a Git repository (or includes Git repositories), *fd* does not
search folders (and does not show files) that match one of the `.gitignore` patterns. To disable
this behavior, we can use the `-I` (or `--no-ignore`) option:
``` bash
&gt; fd num_cpu
&gt; fd -I num_cpu
target/debug/deps/libnum_cpus-f5ce7ef99006aa05.rlib
```

To really search *all* files and directories, simply combine the hidden and ignore features to show
everything (`-HI`) or use `-u`/`--unrestricted`.

### Matching the full path
By default, *fd* only matches the filename of each file. However, using the `--full-path` or `-p` option,
you can match against the full path.

```bash
&gt; fd -p -g &#039;**/.git/config&#039;
&gt; fd -p &#039;.*/lesson-\d+/[a-z]+.(jpg|png)&#039;
```

### Command execution

Instead of just showing the search results, you often want to *do something* with them. `fd`
provides two ways to execute external commands for each of your search results:

* The `-x`/`--exec` option runs an external command *for each of the search results* (in parallel).
* The `-X`/`--exec-batch` option launches the external command once, with *all search results as arguments*.

#### Examples

Recursively find all zip archives and unpack them:
``` bash
fd -e zip -x unzip
```
If there are two such files, `file1.zip` and `backup/file2.zip`, this would execute
`unzip file1.zip` and `unzip backup/file2.zip`. The two `unzip` processes run in parallel
(if the files are found fast enough).

Find all `*.h` and `*.cpp` files and auto-format them inplace with `clang-format -i`:
``` bash
fd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i
```
Note how the `-i` option to `clang-format` can be passed as a separate argument. This is why
we put the `-x` option last.

Find all `test_*.py` files and open them in your favorite editor:
``` bash
fd -g &#039;test_*.py&#039; -X vim
```
Note that we use capital `-X` here to open a single `vim` instance. If there are two such files,
`test_basic.py` and `lib/test_advanced.py`, this will run `vim test_basic.py lib/test_advanced.py`.

To see details like file permissions, owners, file sizes etc., you can tell `fd` to show them
by running `ls` for each result:
``` bash
fd … -X ls -lhd --color=always
```
This pattern is so useful that `fd` provides a shortcut. You can use the `-l`/`--list-details`
option to execute `ls` in this way: `fd … -l`.

The `-X` option is also useful when combining `fd` with [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/) (`rg`) in order to search within a certain class of files, like all C++ source files:
```bash
fd -e cpp -e cxx -e h -e hpp -X rg &#039;std::cout&#039;
```

Convert all `*.jpg` files to `*.png` files:
``` bash
fd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png
```
Here, `{}` is a placeholder for the search result. `{.}` is the same, without the file extension.
See below for more details on the placeholder syntax.

The terminal output of commands run from parallel threads using `-x` will not be interlaced or garbled,
so `fd -x` can be used to rudimentarily parallelize a task run over many files.
An example of this is calculating the checksum of each individual file within a directory.
```
fd -tf -x md5sum &gt; file_checksums.txt
```

#### Placeholder syntax

The `-x` and `-X` options take a *command template* as a series of arguments (instead of a single string).
If you want to add additional options to `fd` after the command template, you can terminate it with a `\;`.

The syntax for generating commands is similar to that of [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/):

- `{}`: A placeholder token that will be replaced with the path of the search result
  (`documents/images/party.jpg`).
- `{.}`: Like `{}`, but without the file extension (`documents/images/party`).
- `{/}`: A placeholder that will be replaced by the basename of the search result (`party.jpg`).
- `{//}`: The parent of the discovered path (`documents/images`).
- `{/.}`: The basename, with the extension removed (`party`).

If you do not include a placeholder, *fd* automatically adds a `{}` at the end.

#### Parallel vs. serial execution

For `-x`/`--exec`, you can control the number of parallel jobs by using the `-j`/`--threads` option.
Use `--threads=1` for serial execution.

### Excluding specific files or directories

Sometimes we want to ignore search results from a specific subdirectory. For example, we might
want to search all hidden files and directories (`-H`) but exclude all matches from `.git`
directories. We can use the `-E` (or `--exclude`) option for this. It takes an arbitrary glob
pattern as an argument:
``` bash
&gt; fd -H -E .git …
```

We can also use this to skip mounted directories:
``` bash
&gt; fd -E /mnt/external-drive …
```

.. or to skip certain file types:
``` bash
&gt; fd -E &#039;*.bak&#039; …
```

To make exclude-patterns like these permanent, you can create a `.fdignore` file. They work like
`.gitignore` files, but are specific to `fd`. For example:
``` bash
&gt; cat ~/.fdignore
/mnt/external-drive
*.bak
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; `fd` also supports `.ignore` files that are used by other programs such as `rg` or `ag`.

If you want `fd` to ignore these patterns globally, you can put them in `fd`&#039;s global ignore file.
This is usually located in `~/.config/fd/ignore` in macOS or Linux, and `%APPDATA%\fd\ignore` in
Windows.

You may wish to include `.git/` in your `fd/ignore` file so that `.git` directories, and their contents
are not included in output if you use the `--hidden` option.

### Deleting files

You can use `fd` to remove all files and directories that are matched by your search pattern.
If you only want to remove files, you can use the `--exec-batch`/`-X` option to call `rm`. For
example, to recursively remove all `.DS_Store` files, run:
``` bash
&gt; fd -H &#039;^\.DS_Store$&#039; -tf -X rm
```
If you are unsure, always call `fd` without `-X rm` first. Alternatively, use `rm`s &quot;interactive&quot;
option:
``` bash
&gt; fd -H &#039;^\.DS_Store$&#039; -tf -X rm -i
```

If you also want to remove a certain class of directories, you can use the same technique. You will
have to use `rm`s `--recursive`/`-r` flag to remove directories.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; There are scenarios where using `fd … -X rm -r` can cause race conditions: if you have a
path like `…/foo/bar/foo/…` and want to remove all directories named `foo`, you can end up in a
situation where the outer `foo` directory is removed first, leading to (harmless) *&quot;&#039;foo/bar/foo&#039;:
No such file or directory&quot;* errors in the `rm` call.

### Command-line options

This is the output of `fd -h`. To see the full set of command-line options, use `fd --help` which
also includes a much more detailed help text.

## Benchmark

Let&#039;s search my home folder for files that end in `[0-9].jpg`. It contains ~750.000
subdirectories and about a 4 million files. For averaging and statistical analysis, I&#039;m using
[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine). The following benchmarks are performed
with a &quot;warm&quot;/pre-filled disk-cache (results for a &quot;cold&quot; disk-cache show the same trends).

Let&#039;s start with `find`:
```
Benchmark 1: find ~ -iregex &#039;.*[0-9]\.jpg$&#039;
  Time (mean ± σ):     19.922 s ±  0.109 s
  Range (min … max):   19.765 s … 20.065 s
```

`find` is much faster if it does not need to perform a regular-expression search:
```
Benchmark 2: find ~ -iname &#039;*[0-9].jpg&#039;
  Time (mean ± σ):     11.226 s ±  0.104 s
  Range (min … max):   11.119 s … 11.466 s
```

Now let&#039;s try the same for `fd`. Note that `fd` performs a regular expression
search by default. The options `-u`/`--unrestricted` option is needed here for
a fair comparison. Otherwise `fd` does not have to traverse hidden folders and
ignored paths (see below):
```
Benchmark 3: fd -u &#039;[0-9]\.jpg$&#039; ~
  Time (mean ± σ):     854.8 ms ±  10.0 ms
  Range (min … max):   839.2 ms … 868.9 ms
```
For this particular example, `fd` is approximately **23 times faster** than `find -iregex`
and about **13 times faster** than `find -iname`. By the way, both tools found the exact
same 546 files :smile:.

**Note**: This is *one particular* benchmark on *one particular* machine. While we have
performed a lot of different tests (and found consistent results), things might
be different for you! We encourage everyone to try it out on their own. See
[this repository](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd-benchmarks) for all necessary scripts.

Concerning *fd*&#039;s speed, a lot of credit goes to the `regex` and `ignore` crates that are
also used in [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (check it out!).

## Troubleshooting

### `fd` does not find my file!

Remember that `fd` ignores hidden directories and files by default. It also ignores patterns
from `.gitignore` files. If you want to make sure to find absolutely every possible file, always
use the options `-u`/`--unrestricted` option (or `-HI` to enable hidden and ignored files):
``` bash
&gt; fd -u …
```

Also remember that by default, `fd` only searches based on the filename and
doesn&#039;t compare the pattern to the full path. If you want to search based on the
full path (similar to the `-path` option of `find`) you need to use the `--full-path`
(or `-p`) option.

### Colorized output

`fd` can colorize files by extension, just like `ls`. In order for this to work, the environment
variable [`LS_COLORS`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/dir_colors) has to be set. Typically, the value
of this variable is set by the `dircolors` command which provides a convenient configuration format
to define colors for different file formats.
On most distributions, `LS_COLORS` should be set already. If you are on Windows or if you are looking
for alternative, more complete (or more colorful) variants, see [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid),
[here](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized) or
[here](https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS).

`fd` also honors the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) environment variable.

### `fd` doesn&#039;t seem to interpret my regex pattern correctly

A lot of special regex characters (like `[]`, `^`, `$`, ..) are also special characters in your
shell. If in doubt, always make sure to put single quotes around the regex pattern:

``` bash
&gt; fd &#039;^[A-Z][0-9]+$&#039;
```

If your pattern starts with a dash, you have to add `--` to signal the end of command line
options. Otherwise, the pattern will be interpreted as a command-line option. Alternatively,
use a character class with a single hyphen character:

``` bash
&gt; fd -- &#039;-pattern&#039;
&gt; fd &#039;[-]pattern&#039;
```

### &quot;Command not found&quot; for `alias`es or shell functions

Shell `alias`es and shell functions can not be used for command execution via `fd -x` or
`fd -X`. In `zsh`, you can make the alias global via `alias -g myalias=&quot;…&quot;`. In `bash`,
you can use `export -f my_function` to make available to child processes. You would still
need to call `fd -x bash -c &#039;my_function &quot;$1&quot;&#039; bash`. For other use cases or shells, use
a (temporary) shell script.

## Integration with other programs

### Using fd with `fzf`

You can use *fd* to generate input for the command-line fuzzy finder [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf):
``` bash
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=&#039;fd --type file&#039;
export FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND=&quot;$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND&quot;
```

Then, you can type `vim &lt;Ctrl-T&gt;` on your terminal to open fzf and search through the fd-results.

Alternatively, you might like to follow symbolic links and include hidden files (but exclude `.git` folders):
``` bash
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=&#039;fd --type file --follow --hidden --exclude .git&#039;
```

You can even use fd&#039;s colored output inside fzf by setting:
``` bash
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=&quot;fd --type file --color=always&quot;
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&quot;--ansi&quot;
```

For more details, see the [Tips section](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#tips) of the fzf README.

### Using fd with `rofi`

[*rofi*](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) is a graphical launch menu application that is able to create menus by reading from *stdin*. Piping `fd` output into `rofi`s `-dmenu` mode creates fuzzy-searchable lists of files and directories.

#### Example

Create a case-insensitive searchable multi-select list of *PDF* files under your `$HOME` directory and open the selection with your configured PDF viewer. To list all file types, drop the `-e pdf` argument.

``` bash
fd --type f -e pdf . $HOME | rofi -keep-right -dmenu -i -p FILES -multi-select | xargs -I {} xdg-open {}
```

To modify the list that is presented by rofi, add arguments to the `fd` command. To modify the search behaviour of rofi, add arguments to the `rofi` command.

### Using fd with `emacs`

The emacs package [find-file-in-project](https://github.com/technomancy/find-file-in-project) can
use *fd* to find files.

After installing `find-file-in-project`, add the line `(setq ffip-use-rust-fd t)` to your
`~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file.

In emacs, run `M-x find-file-in-project-by-selected` to find matching files. Alternatively, run
`M-x find-file-in-project` to list all available files in the project.

### Printing the output as a tree

To format the output of `fd` as a file-tree you can use the `tree` command with
`--fromfile`:
```bash
❯ fd | tree --fromfile
```

This can be more useful than running `tree` by itself because `tree` does not
ignore any files by default, nor does it support as rich a set of options as
`fd` does to control what to print:
```bash
❯ fd --extension rs | tree --fromfile
.
├── build.rs
└── src
    ├── app.rs
    └── error.rs
```

On bash and similar you can simply create an alias:
```bash
❯ alias as-tree=&#039;tree --fromfile&#039;
```

A safety oriented and memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust.

## Status of this project

Sudo-rs is being developed further; features you might expect from original sudo
may still be unimplemented or not planned. If there is an important one you need,
please request it using the issue tracker. If you encounter any usability bugs,
also please report them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/issues).
Suspected vulnerabilities can be reported on our [security page](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/security).

An [audit of sudo-rs version 0.2.0](docs/audit/audit-report-sudo-rs.pdf) has been performed in August 2023.
The findings from that audit are addressed in the current version.

Sudo-rs currently is targeted for FreeBSD and Linux-based operating systems only.

## Installing sudo-rs

The recommended way to start using `sudo-rs` is via the package manager of your Linux distribution.

### Debian/Ubuntu
If you are running Debian 13 (trixie) or later, or Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat) or later, you can use:
```sh
apt-get install sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`. If you want to invoke sudo-rs
via the usual commands `sudo` and `su` instead, prepend `/usr/lib/cargo/bin` to your current `$PATH` variable.

### Fedora

If you are running Fedora 38 or later, you can use:
```sh
dnf install sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux can be installed from the distribution repositories:
```sh
pacman -S sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`.

### Installing our pre-compiled x86-64 binaries

You can also switch to sudo-rs manually by using our pre-compiled tarballs.
We currently only offer these for x86-64 systems.

We recommend installing sudo-rs and su-s in your `/usr/local` hierarchy so it can co-exist with
your existing sudo installation. You can achieve this using the commands:
```sh
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf sudo-0.2.6.tar.gz
```
and for su-rs:
```sh
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf su-0.2.6.tar.gz
```
This will install sudo-rs and su-rs in `/usr/local/bin` using the usual commands `sudo` and `su`; it
will also install our version of `visudo` in that location.

Of course, if you **don&#039;t** have Todd Miller&#039;s `sudo` installed, you also have to make sure that:

* You manually create a `/etc/sudoers` or `/etc/sudoers-rs` file, this could be as simple as:

      Defaults secure_path=&quot;/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin&quot;

      %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

  `sudo-rs` will try to process `/etc/sudoers-rs` exists if it exists, otherwise it will use `/etc/sudoers`.
  For an explanation of the sudoers syntax you can look at the
  [sudoers man page](https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/sudoers.man/).

* (Strongly recommended) You create `/etc/pam.d/sudo` and `/etc/pam.d/sudo-i` files that contain:

      session required pam_limits.so

      @include common-auth
      @include common-account
      @include common-session-noninteractive

  If you don&#039;t do this, either a &quot;fallback&quot; PAM policy will be used or `sudo-rs` will simply refuse to run
  since it cannot initialize PAM. On FreeBSD, you may want to put these files in `/usr/local/etc/pam.d` instead.

### Building from source

Sudo-rs is written in Rust. The minimum required Rust version is 1.70. If your
Linux distribution does not package that version (or a later one), you can always
install the most recent version through [rustup]. You also need the C development
files for PAM (`libpam0g-dev` on Debian, `pam-devel` on Fedora).

On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, use the following command to install the PAM development library:
```
sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev
```

On Fedora, CentOS and other Red Hat-based systems, you can use the following command:
```
sudo yum install pam-devel
```

With dependencies installed, building sudo-rs is a simple matter of:
```
cargo build --release
```

This produces a binary `target/release/sudo`. However, this binary must have
the setuid flag set and must be owned by the root user in order to provide any
useful functionality. Consult your operating system manual for details.

Sudo-rs then also needs the configuration files; please follow the installation
suggestions in the previous section.

### Feature flags

#### --features pam-login
By default, sudo-rs will use the PAM service name `sudo`. On Debian and Fedora
systems, it is customary that the name `sudo-i` is used when the `-i / --login`
command line option is used. To get this behaviour, enable the `pam-login`
feature when building:
```
cargo build --release --features pam-login
```
This feature is enabled on our pre-supplied binaries.

#### --features apparmor
sudo-rs has support for selecting AppArmor profile on Linux distributions that
support AppArmor such as Debian and Ubuntu. To enable this feature, build sudo-rs
with apparmor support enabled:
```
cargo build --release --features apparmor
```

This feature is disabled on our pre-supplied binaries.

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

## Differences from original sudo

sudo-rs supports less functionality than sudo. Some of this is by design. In
most cases you will get a clear error if you try something that is not
supported (e.g. use a configuration flag or command line option that is not
implemented).

Exceptions to the above, with respect to your `/etc/sudoers` configuration:

* `use_pty` is enabled by default, but can be disabled.
* `env_reset` is ignored --- this is always enabled.
* `visiblepw` is ignored --- this is always disabled.
* `verifypw` is currently ignored; a password is always necessary for `sudo -v`.
* `mail_badpass`, `always_set_home`, `always_query_group_plugin` and
  `match_group_by_gid` are not applicable to our implementation, but ignored for
  compatibility reasons.
* `timestamp_type` is always set at `tty`.
* the (NO)PASSWD tag on the &quot;list&quot; pseudocommand will determine whether a password
  is required for the `sudo -U --list` command, instead of `listpw`.

Some other notable restrictions to be aware of:

* Some functionality is not supported, such as preventing shell escapes using `INTERCEPT` and
  storing config in LDAP using `sudoers.ldap`, and `cvtsudoers`.
* Sudo-rs always uses PAM for authentication, so your system must be set up for PAM.
  Sudo-rs will use the `sudo` and `sudo-i` service configuration. This also means
  that resource limits, umasks, etc have to be configured via PAM and not through
  the sudoers file.
* sudo-rs will not include the sendmail support of original sudo.
* The sudoers file must be valid UTF-8.
* To prevent a common configuration mistake in the sudoers file, wildcards
  are not supported in *argument positions* for a command.
  E.g., `%sudoers ALL = /sbin/fsck*` will allow `sudo fsck` and `sudo fsck_exfat` as expected,
  but `%sudoers ALL = /bin/rm *.txt` will not allow an operator to run `sudo rm README.txt`,
  nor `sudo rm -rf /home .txt`, as with original sudo.

If you find a common use case for original sudo missing, please create a feature
request for it in our issue tracker.

## Aim of the project

Our current target is to build a drop-in replacement for all common use cases of
sudo. For the sudoers config syntax this means that we support the default
configuration files of common Linux distributions. Our implementation should support
all commonly used command line options from the original sudo implementation.

Some parts of the original sudo are explicitly not in scope. Sudo has a large
and rich history and some of the features available in the original sudo
implementation are largely unused or only available for legacy platforms. In
order to determine which features make it we both consider whether the feature
is relevant for modern systems, and whether it will receive at very least
decent usage. Finally, of course, a feature should not compromise the safety of
the whole program.

Our `su` implementation is made using the building blocks we created for our
sudo implementation.  It is a suitable replacement for the `su` distributed
by [util-linux].

[util-linux]: https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux

## Future work

While our initial target is a drop-in replacement for most basic use cases of
sudo, our work may evolve beyond that target. We are also looking into
alternative ways to configure sudo without the sudoers config file syntax and to
extract parts of our work in usable crates for other people.

## History

The initial development of sudo-rs was started and funded by the [Internet Security Research Group](https://www.abetterinternet.org/) as part of the [Prossimo project](https://www.memorysafety.org/)

## Acknowledgements

Sudo-rs is an independent implementation, but it incorporates documentation and Rust translations of code from [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/), maintained by Todd C. Miller. We thank Todd and the other sudo contributors for their work.

An independent security audit of sudo-rs was made possible by the [NLNet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/), who also [sponsored](https://nlnet.nl/project/sudo-rs/) work on increased compatibility with the original sudo and the FreeBSD port.

The sudo-rs project would not have existed without the support of its sponsors, a full overview is maintained at https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/privilege-boundary/

This repository has the source code for Comprehensive Rust 🦀, a multi-day Rust
course developed by the Android team. The course covers all aspects of Rust,
from basic syntax to generics and error handling. It also includes deep dives on
[Android], [Chromium], [bare-metal], and [concurrency].

[bare-metal]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html
[concurrency]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html

Read the course at **https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/**.

## Course Format and Target Audience

The course is used internally at Google when teaching Rust to experienced
software engineers. They typically have a background in C++ or Java.

The course is taught in a classroom setting and we hope it will be useful for
others who want to teach Rust to their team. The course will be less useful for
self-study since you miss out on the discussions happening in the classroom. You
don&#039;t see the questions and answers and you don&#039;t see the compiler errors we
trigger when going through the code samples. We hope to improve on this via
[speaker notes](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/53) and by
[publishing videos](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/52).

## Quick Start

&gt; The following text only describes the use of the command-line tool; the GUI program can be configured by referring to the following concepts.

Make sure EasyTier is installed according to the [Installation Guide](#Installation), and both easytier-core and easytier-cli commands are available.

### Two-node Networking

Assuming the network topology of the two nodes is as follows

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph Node A IP 22.1.1.1
nodea[EasyTier\n10.144.144.1]
end

subgraph Node B
nodeb[EasyTier\n10.144.144.2]
end

nodea &lt;-----&gt; nodeb

```

1. Execute on Node A:

    ```sh
    sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.1
    ```

    Successful execution of the command will print the following.

    ![alt text](/assets/image-2.png)

2. Execute on Node B

    ```sh
    sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.2 --peers udp://22.1.1.1:11010
    ```

3. Test Connectivity

    The two nodes should connect successfully and be able to communicate within the virtual subnet

    ```sh
    ping 10.144.144.2
    ```

    Use easytier-cli to view node information in the subnet

    ```sh
    easytier-cli peer
    ```

    ![alt text](/assets/image.png)

    ```sh
    easytier-cli route
    ```

    ![alt text](/assets/image-1.png)


    ```sh
    easytier-cli node
    ```

    ![alt text](assets/image-10.png)

---

### Multi-node Networking

Based on the two-node networking example just now, if more nodes need to join the virtual network, you can use the following command.

```sh
sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.2 --peers udp://22.1.1.1:11010
```

The `--peers` parameter can fill in the listening address of any node already in the virtual network.

---

### Subnet Proxy (Point-to-Network) Configuration

Assuming the network topology is as follows, Node B wants to share its accessible subnet 10.1.1.0/24 with other nodes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph Node A IP 22.1.1.1
nodea[EasyTier\n10.144.144.1]
end

subgraph Node B
nodeb[EasyTier\n10.144.144.2]
end

id1[[10.1.1.0/24]]

nodea &lt;--&gt; nodeb &lt;-.-&gt; id1

```

Then the startup parameters for Node B&#039;s easytier are (new -n parameter)

```sh
sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.2 -n 10.1.1.0/24
```

Subnet proxy information will automatically sync to each node in the virtual network, and each node will automatically configure the corresponding route. Node A can check whether the subnet proxy is effective through the following command.

1. Check whether the routing information has been synchronized, the proxy_cidrs column shows the proxied subnets.

    ```sh
    easytier-cli route
    ```

   ![alt text](/assets/image-3.png)

2. Test whether Node A can access nodes under the proxied subnet

    ```sh
    ping 10.1.1.2
    ```

---

### Networking without Public IP

EasyTier supports networking using shared public nodes. The currently deployed shared public node is ``tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010``.

When using shared nodes, each node entering the network needs to provide the same ``--network-name`` and ``--network-secret`` parameters as the unique identifier of the network.

Taking two nodes as an example, Node A executes:

```sh
sudo easytier-core -i 10.144.144.1 --network-name abc --network-secret abc -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010
```

Node B executes

```sh
sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.2 --network-name abc --network-secret abc -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010
```

After the command is successfully executed, Node A can access Node B through the virtual IP 10.144.144.2.

### Use EasyTier with WireGuard Client

EasyTier can be used as a WireGuard server to allow any device with WireGuard client installed to access the EasyTier network. For platforms currently unsupported by EasyTier (such as iOS, Android, etc.), this method can be used to connect to the EasyTier network.

Assuming the network topology is as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

ios[[iPhone \n WireGuard Installed]]

subgraph Node A IP 22.1.1.1
nodea[EasyTier\n10.144.144.1]
end

subgraph Node B
nodeb[EasyTier\n10.144.144.2]
end

id1[[10.1.1.0/24]]

ios &lt;-.-&gt; nodea &lt;--&gt; nodeb &lt;-.-&gt; id1
```

To enable an iPhone to access the EasyTier network through Node A, the following configuration can be applied:

Include the --vpn-portal parameter in the easytier-core command on Node A to specify the port that the WireGuard service listens on and the subnet used by the WireGuard network.

```sh
# The following parameters mean: listen on port 0.0.0.0:11013, and use the 10.14.14.0/24 subnet for WireGuard
sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.1 --vpn-portal wg://0.0.0.0:11013/10.14.14.0/24
```

After successfully starting easytier-core, use easytier-cli to obtain the WireGuard client configuration.

```sh
$&gt; easytier-cli vpn-portal
portal_name: wireguard

############### client_config_start ###############

[Interface]
PrivateKey = 9VDvlaIC9XHUvRuE06hD2CEDrtGF+0lDthgr9SZfIho=
Address = 10.14.14.0/32 # should assign an ip from this cidr manually

[Peer]
PublicKey = zhrZQg4QdPZs8CajT3r4fmzcNsWpBL9ImQCUsnlXyGM=
AllowedIPs = 10.144.144.0/24,10.14.14.0/24
Endpoint = 0.0.0.0:11013 # should be the public ip(or domain) of the vpn server
PersistentKeepalive = 25

############### client_config_end ###############

connected_clients:
[]
```

Before using the Client Config, you need to modify the Interface Address and Peer Endpoint to the client&#039;s IP and the IP of the EasyTier node, respectively. Import the configuration file into the WireGuard client to access the EasyTier network.

### Self-Hosted Public Server

Every virtual network (with same network name and secret) can act as a public server cluster. Nodes of other network can connect to arbitrary nodes in public server cluster to discover each other without public IP.

Run you own public server cluster is exactly same as running an virtual network, except that you can skip config the ipv4 addr.

You can also join the official public server cluster with following command:

```
sudo easytier-core --network-name easytier --network-secret easytier -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010
```


### Configurations

You can use ``easytier-core --help`` to view all configuration items

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

# zoxide

[![crates.io][crates.io-badge]][crates.io]
[![Downloads][downloads-badge]][releases]
[![Built with Nix][builtwithnix-badge]][builtwithnix]

zoxide is a **smarter cd command**, inspired by z and autojump.

It remembers which directories you use most frequently, so you can &quot;jump&quot; to
them in just a few keystrokes.&lt;br /&gt;
zoxide works on all major shells.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Getting started

![Tutorial][tutorial]

```sh
z foo              # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo
z foo bar          # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo and bar
z foo /            # cd into a subdirectory starting with foo

z ~/foo            # z also works like a regular cd command
z foo/             # cd into relative path
z ..               # cd one level up
z -                # cd into previous directory

zi foo             # cd with interactive selection (using fzf)

z foo&lt;SPACE&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;  # show interactive completions (zoxide v0.8.0+, bash 4.4+/fish/zsh only)
```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;macOS&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; To install zoxide, use a package manager:
   &gt;
   &gt; | Repository      | Instructions                                                                                          |
   &gt; | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   &gt; | **[crates.io]** | `cargo install zoxide --locked`                                                                       |
   &gt; | **[Homebrew]**  | `brew install zoxide`                                                                                 |
   &gt; | [asdf]          | `asdf plugin add zoxide https://github.com/nyrst/asdf-zoxide.git` &lt;br /&gt; `asdf install zoxide latest` |
   &gt; | [conda-forge]   | `conda install -c conda-forge zoxide`                                                                 |
   &gt; | [MacPorts]      | `port install zoxide`                                                                                 |
   &gt; | [nixpkgs]       | `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.zoxide`                                                                          |
   &gt;
   &gt; Or, run this command in your terminal:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh | sh
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Windows&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; zoxide works with PowerShell, as well as shells running in Cygwin, Git
   &gt; Bash, and MSYS2.
   &gt;
   &gt; The recommended way to install zoxide is via `winget`:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; winget install ajeetdsouza.zoxide
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; Or, you can use an alternative package manager:
   &gt;
   &gt; | Repository      | Instructions                          |
   &gt; | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
   &gt; | **[crates.io]** | `cargo install zoxide --locked`       |
   &gt; | [Chocolatey]    | `choco install zoxide`                |
   &gt; | [conda-forge]   | `conda install -c conda-forge zoxide` |
   &gt; | [Scoop]         | `scoop install zoxide`                |
   &gt;
   &gt; If you&#039;re using Cygwin, Git Bash, or MSYS2, you can also use the install script:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh | sh
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;BSD&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; To install zoxide, use a package manager:
   &gt;
   &gt; | Distribution  | Repository      | Instructions                    |
   &gt; | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
   &gt; | **_Any_**     | **[crates.io]** | `cargo install zoxide --locked` |
   &gt; | DragonFly BSD | [DPorts]        | `pkg install zoxide`            |
   &gt; | FreeBSD       | [FreshPorts]    | `pkg install zoxide`            |
   &gt; | NetBSD        | [pkgsrc]        | `pkgin install zoxide`          |
   &gt;
   &gt; Or, run this command in your terminal:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh | bash
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Android&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; To install zoxide, use a package manager:
   &gt;
   &gt; | Repository | Instructions         |
   &gt; | ---------- | -------------------- |
   &gt; | [Termux]   | `pkg install zoxide` |
   &gt;
   &gt; Or, run this command in your terminal:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh | bash
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

2. **Setup zoxide on your shell**

   To start using zoxide, add it to your shell.

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Bash&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file (usually `~/.bashrc`):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; eval &quot;$(zoxide init bash)&quot;
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Elvish&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file (usually `~/.elvish/rc.elv`):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; eval (zoxide init elvish | slurp)
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; **Note**
   &gt; zoxide only supports elvish v0.18.0 and above.

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Fish&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file (usually
   &gt; `~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; zoxide init fish | source
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Nushell&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your env file (find it by running `$nu.env-path`
   &gt; in Nushell):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; zoxide init nushell | save -f ~/.zoxide.nu
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; Now, add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file (find it by running
   &gt; `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; source ~/.zoxide.nu
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; **Note**
   &gt; zoxide only supports Nushell v0.89.0+.

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;PowerShell&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file (find it by running
   &gt; `echo $profile` in PowerShell):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```powershell
   &gt; Invoke-Expression (&amp; { (zoxide init powershell | Out-String) })
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Tcsh&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file (usually `~/.tcshrc`):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; zoxide init tcsh &gt; ~/.zoxide.tcsh
   &gt; source ~/.zoxide.tcsh
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Xonsh&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file (usually `~/.xonshrc`):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```python
   &gt; execx($(zoxide init xonsh), &#039;exec&#039;, __xonsh__.ctx, filename=&#039;zoxide&#039;)
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Zsh&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file (usually `~/.zshrc`):
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; eval &quot;$(zoxide init zsh)&quot;
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; For completions to work, the above line must be added _after_ `compinit` is
   &gt; called. You may have to rebuild your completions cache by running
   &gt; `rm ~/.zcompdump*; compinit`.

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;Any POSIX shell&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Add this to the &lt;ins&gt;**end**&lt;/ins&gt; of your config file:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; eval &quot;$(zoxide init posix --hook prompt)&quot;
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

3. **Install fzf** &lt;sup&gt;(optional)&lt;/sup&gt;

   [fzf] is a command-line fuzzy finder, used by zoxide for completions /
   interactive selection. It can be installed from [here][fzf-installation].

   &gt; **Note**
   &gt; The minimum supported fzf version is v0.51.0.

4. **Import your data** &lt;sup&gt;(optional)&lt;/sup&gt;

   If you currently use any of these plugins, you may want to import your data
   into zoxide:

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;autojump&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Run this command in your terminal:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; zoxide import --from=autojump &quot;/path/to/autojump/db&quot;
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; The path usually varies according to your system:
   &gt;
   &gt; | OS      | Path                                                                                 | Example                                                |
   &gt; | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
   &gt; | Linux   | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump/autojump.txt` or `$HOME/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt` | `/home/alice/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt`       |
   &gt; | macOS   | `$HOME/Library/autojump/autojump.txt`                                                | `/Users/Alice/Library/autojump/autojump.txt`           |
   &gt; | Windows | `%APPDATA%\autojump\autojump.txt`                                                    | `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\autojump\autojump.txt` |

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;fasd, z, z.lua, zsh-z&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Run this command in your terminal:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```sh
   &gt; zoxide import --from=z &quot;path/to/z/db&quot;
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; The path usually varies according to your system:
   &gt;
   &gt; | Plugin           | Path                                                                                |
   &gt; | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   &gt; | fasd             | `$_FASD_DATA` or `$HOME/.fasd`                                                      |
   &gt; | z (bash/zsh)     | `$_Z_DATA` or `$HOME/.z`                                                            |
   &gt; | z (fish)         | `$Z_DATA` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/z/data` or `$HOME/.local/share/z/data`                 |
   &gt; | z.lua (bash/zsh) | `$_ZL_DATA` or `$HOME/.zlua`                                                        |
   &gt; | z.lua (fish)     | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/zlua/zlua.txt` or `$HOME/.local/share/zlua/zlua.txt` or `$_ZL_DATA` |
   &gt; | zsh-z            | `$ZSHZ_DATA` or `$_Z_DATA` or `$HOME/.z`                                            |

   &lt;/details&gt;

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;ZLocation&lt;/summary&gt;

   &gt; Run this command in PowerShell:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```powershell
   &gt; $db = New-TemporaryFile
   &gt; (Get-ZLocation).GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { Write-Output ($_.Name+&#039;|&#039;+$_.Value+&#039;|0&#039;) } | Out-File $db
   &gt; zoxide import --from=z $db
   &gt; ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

## Configuration

### Flags

When calling `zoxide init`, the following flags are available:

- `--cmd`
  - Changes the prefix of the `z` and `zi` commands.
  - `--cmd j` would change the commands to (`j`, `ji`).
  - `--cmd cd` would replace the `cd` command.
- `--hook &lt;HOOK&gt;`
  - Changes how often zoxide increments a directory&#039;s score:

    | Hook            | Description                       |
    | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | `none`          | Never                             |
    | `prompt`        | At every shell prompt             |
    | `pwd` (default) | Whenever the directory is changed |

- `--no-cmd`
  - Prevents zoxide from defining the `z` and `zi` commands.
  - These functions will still be available in your shell as `__zoxide_z` and
    `__zoxide_zi`, should you choose to redefine them.

### Environment variables

Environment variables[^2] can be used for configuration. They must be set before
`zoxide init` is called.

- `_ZO_DATA_DIR`
  - Specifies the directory in which the database is stored.
  - The default value varies across OSes:

    | OS          | Path                                     | Example                                    |
    | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
    | Linux / BSD | `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or `$HOME/.local/share` | `/home/alice/.local/share`                 |
    | macOS       | `$HOME/Library/Application Support`      | `/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support` |
    | Windows     | `%LOCALAPPDATA%`                         | `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local`             |

- `_ZO_ECHO`
  - When set to 1, `z` will print the matched directory before navigating to
    it.
- `_ZO_EXCLUDE_DIRS`
  - Excludes the specified directories from the database.
  - This is provided as a list of [globs][glob], separated by OS-specific
    characters:

    | OS                  | Separator | Example                 |
    | ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
    | Linux / macOS / BSD | `:`       | `$HOME:$HOME/private/*` |
    | Windows             | `;`       | `$HOME;$HOME/private/*` |

  - By default, this is set to `&quot;$HOME&quot;`.
- `_ZO_FZF_OPTS`
  - Custom options to pass to [fzf] during interactive selection. See
    [`man fzf`][fzf-man] for the list of options.
- `_ZO_MAXAGE`
  - Configures the [aging algorithm][algorithm-aging], which limits the maximum
    number of entries in the database.
  - By default, this is set to 10000.
- `_ZO_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS`
  - When set to 1, `z` will resolve symlinks before adding directories to the
    database.

## Usage

Requires Rust 1.63 or greater.

PyO3 supports the following Python distributions:
  - CPython 3.7 or greater
  - PyPy 7.3 (Python 3.9+)
  - GraalPy 24.2 or greater (Python 3.11+)

You can use PyO3 to write a native Python module in Rust, or to embed Python in a Rust binary. The following sections explain each of these in turn.

### Using Rust from Python

PyO3 can be used to generate a native Python module. The easiest way to try this out for the first time is to use [`maturin`](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin). `maturin` is a tool for building and publishing Rust-based Python packages with minimal configuration. The following steps install `maturin`, use it to generate and build a new Python package, and then launch Python to import and execute a function from the package.

First, follow the commands below to create a new directory containing a new Python `virtualenv`, and install `maturin` into the virtualenv using Python&#039;s package manager, `pip`:

```bash
# (replace string_sum with the desired package name)
$ mkdir string_sum
$ cd string_sum
$ python -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install maturin
```

Still inside this `string_sum` directory, now run `maturin init`. This will generate the new package source. When given the choice of bindings to use, select pyo3 bindings:

```bash
$ maturin init
✔ 🤷 What kind of bindings to use? · pyo3
  ✨ Done! New project created string_sum
```

The most important files generated by this command are `Cargo.toml` and `lib.rs`, which will look roughly like the following:

**`Cargo.toml`**

```toml
[package]
name = &quot;string_sum&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

[lib]
# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import string_sum`). If you change this, you must also change the name of the
# `#[pymodule]` in `src/lib.rs`.
name = &quot;string_sum&quot;
# &quot;cdylib&quot; is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.
#
# Downstream Rust code (including code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
# to `use string_sum;` unless the &quot;rlib&quot; or &quot;lib&quot; crate type is also included, e.g.:
# crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;, &quot;rlib&quot;]
crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;]

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = &quot;0.25.0&quot;, features = [&quot;extension-module&quot;] }
```

**`src/lib.rs`**

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;

/// Formats the sum of two numbers as string.
#[pyfunction]
fn sum_as_string(a: usize, b: usize) -&gt; PyResult&lt;String&gt; {
    Ok((a + b).to_string())
}

/// A Python module implemented in Rust. The name of this function must match
/// the `lib.name` setting in the `Cargo.toml`, else Python will not be able to
/// import the module.
#[pymodule]
fn string_sum(m: &amp;Bound&lt;&#039;_, PyModule&gt;) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(sum_as_string, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Finally, run `maturin develop`. This will build the package and install it into the Python virtualenv previously created and activated. The package is then ready to be used from `python`:

```bash
$ maturin develop
# lots of progress output as maturin runs the compilation...
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import string_sum
&gt;&gt;&gt; string_sum.sum_as_string(5, 20)
&#039;25&#039;
```

To make changes to the package, just edit the Rust source code and then re-run `maturin develop` to recompile.

To run this all as a single copy-and-paste, use the bash script below (replace `string_sum` in the first command with the desired package name):

```bash
mkdir string_sum &amp;&amp; cd &quot;$_&quot;
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin
maturin init --bindings pyo3
maturin develop
```

If you want to be able to run `cargo test` or use this project in a Cargo workspace and are running into linker issues, there are some workarounds in [the FAQ](https://pyo3.rs/latest/faq.html#i-cant-run-cargo-test-or-i-cant-build-in-a-cargo-workspace-im-having-linker-issues-like-symbol-not-found-or-undefined-reference-to-_pyexc_systemerror).

As well as with `maturin`, it is possible to build using [`setuptools-rust`](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust) or [manually](https://pyo3.rs/latest/building-and-distribution.html#manual-builds). Both offer more flexibility than `maturin` but require more configuration to get started.

### Using Python from Rust

To embed Python into a Rust binary, you need to ensure that your Python installation contains a shared library. The following steps demonstrate how to ensure this (for Ubuntu), and then give some example code which runs an embedded Python interpreter.

To install the Python shared library on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

To install the Python shared library on RPM based distributions (e.g. Fedora, Red Hat, SuSE), install the `python3-devel` package.


Start a new project with `cargo new` and add  `pyo3` to the `Cargo.toml` like this:

```toml
[dependencies.pyo3]
version = &quot;0.25.0&quot;
features = [&quot;auto-initialize&quot;]
```

Example program displaying the value of `sys.version` and the current user name:

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::types::IntoPyDict;
use pyo3::ffi::c_str;

fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    Python::with_gil(|py| {
        let sys = py.import(&quot;sys&quot;)?;
        let version: String = sys.getattr(&quot;version&quot;)?.extract()?;

        let locals = [(&quot;os&quot;, py.import(&quot;os&quot;)?)].into_py_dict(py)?;
        let code = c_str!(&quot;os.getenv(&#039;USER&#039;) or os.getenv(&#039;USERNAME&#039;) or &#039;Unknown&#039;&quot;);
        let user: String = py.eval(code, None, Some(&amp;locals))?.extract()?;

        println!(&quot;Hello {}, I&#039;m Python {}&quot;, user, version);
        Ok(())
    })
}
```

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we used Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we’ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:
* We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    * Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    * Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
* We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3rd 2024 the last beta release.
* We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4th 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
* We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28th 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
* We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) in June 20th 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth Book](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.86.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/04/03/Rust-1.86.0/).

See the book for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source.html).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [book][book].

If the answer is not there:

- Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or
- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or
- Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-bug%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug.yml)

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80) . Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

It&#039;s pronounced as &quot;you - vee&quot; ([`/juː viː/`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key))

#### How should I stylize uv?

Just &quot;uv&quot;, please. See the [style guide](./STYLE.md#styling-uv) for details.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

&lt;/p&gt;

Difftastic is a structural diff tool that compares files based on
their syntax.

**For installation instructions, see
[Installation](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/installation.html) in
[the manual](http://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/).**

## Basic Example

![Screenshot of difftastic and JS](img/js.png)

In this JavaScript example, we can see:

(1) Difftastic understands nesting. It highlights the matching `{` and
`}`, but understands that `foo()` hasn&#039;t changed despite the leading
whitespace.

(2) Difftastic understands which lines should be aligned. It&#039;s aligned
`bar(1)` on the left with `bar(2)` on the right, even though the
textual content isn&#039;t identical.

(3) Difftastic understands that line-wrapping isn&#039;t
meaningful. `&quot;eric&quot;` is now on a new line, but it hasn&#039;t changed.

## One Minute Demo

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/480875.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/480875)

This one minute screencast demonstrates difftastic usage with both
standalone files and git.

## Languages

Difftastic supports over 30 programming languages, see [the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/languages_supported.html) for the full list.

If a file has an unrecognised extension, difftastic uses a
textual diff with word highlighting.

## Known Issues

Performance. Difftastic scales relatively poorly on files with a large
number of changes, and can use a lot of memory.

Display. Difftastic has a side-by-side display which usually works well, but can
be confusing.

Robustness. Difftastic regularly has releases that fix crashes.

## Non-goals

Patching. Difftastic output is intended for human consumption, and it
does not generate patches that you can apply later. Use `diff` if you
need a patch.

(Patch files are also line-oriented, which is too limited for
difftastic. Difftastic might find additions and removals on the same
line, and it tracks the relationship between line numbers in the old
and new file.)

Merging. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not
address.

## FAQ

### Isn&#039;t this basically `--word-diff --ignore-all-space`?

Word diffing [can&#039;t do
this](https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/1510139929971421191/photo/1).

Difftastic parses your code. It understands when whitespace matters,
such as inside string literals or languages like Python. It understands
that `x-1` is three tokens in JS but one token in Lisp.

### Can I use difftastic with git?

You can! The difftastic manual [includes instructions for git
usage](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html). You can also use it
[with mercurial](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/mercurial.html).

If you&#039;re an Emacs user, check out [this blog
post](https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html)
showing one way to use difftastic with magit, as well as
[difftastic.el](https://github.com/pkryger/difftastic.el).

### Does difftastic integrate with my favourite tool?

Probably not. Difftastic is young. Consider writing a plugin for your
favourite tool, and I will link it in the README!

### What about parse errors?

By default, difftastic falls back to a line-oriented diff whenever
parse errors are encountered.

This is a conservative choice to ensure that difftastic never claims
two syntactically different files are the same.

Parse errors can occur if the file uses language features that the
parser does not understand, if the language relies on a preprocessor
before parsing (e.g. C++), or if the file has genuine syntactic
mistakes.

In practice, difftastic virtually always produces a good result when
there are a few minor parse errors. Consider allowing a small number
of parse errors when using difftastic.

```
$ export DFT_PARSE_ERROR_LIMIT=20
$ difft foo1.c foo2.c
```

### Can difftastic help me with merge conflicts?

Yes! As of version 0.50, difftastic understands merge conflict markers
(i.e. `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;`, `=======` and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`).

Pass your file with conflicts as a single argument to
difftastic. Difftastic will construct the two conflicting files and
diff those.

```
$ difft file_with_conflicts.js
```

### Can difftastic do merges?

No. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not address.

AST diffing is a lossy process from the perspective of a text
diff. Difftastic will ignore whitespace that isn&#039;t syntactically
significant, but merging requires tracking whitespace.

The [mergiraf](https://mergiraf.org/) tool does offer merges based on
a tree-sitter AST however.

### Can difftastic ignore reordering?

No. Difftastic always considers order to be important, so diffing
e.g. `set(1, 2)` and `set(2, 1)` will show changes.

If you&#039;re diffing JSON, consider sorting the keys before passing them
to difftastic.

```
$ difft &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_1.json) &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_2.json)
```

See also [Tricky Cases: Unordered Data
Types](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/tricky_cases.html#unordered-data-types)
in the manual.

### Can I use difftastic to check for syntactic changes without diffing?

Yes. Difftastic can check if the two files have the same AST, without
calculating a diff. This is much faster than normal diffing, and
useful for building tools that check for changes.

For example:

```
$ difft --check-only --exit-code before.js after.js
```

This will set the exit code to 0 if there are no syntactic changes, or
1 if there are changes found.

### Why aren&#039;t colours appearing in my terminal?

Difftastic uses ANSI bright colours by default, but some terminal
themes show bright colours as grey. Solarized is a popular theme that
does this.

If you&#039;re a Solarized user, use `export DFT_BACKGROUND=light` to
disable bright colours, or try a different terminal colour scheme.

### How does it work?

Difftastic treats structural diffing as a graph problem, and uses
Dijkstra&#039;s algorithm.

My [blog
post](https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/)
describes the design, and there is also an [internals section in the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/diffing.html).

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

([egui 的中文翻译文档 / chinese translation](https://github.com/Re-Ch-Love/egui-doc-cn/blob/main/README_zh-hans.md))


## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies:

* [`ab_glyph`](https://crates.io/crates/ab_glyph)
* [`ahash`](https://crates.io/crates/ahash)
* [`bitflags`](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags)
* [`nohash-hasher`](https://crates.io/crates/nohash-hasher)
* [`parking_lot`](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)

Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, …)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

### Writing your own egui integration
Missing an integration for the thing you&#039;re working on? Create one, it&#039;s easy!
See &lt;https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#integrating-with-egui&gt;.


## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

[Ratatui][Ratatui Website] (_ˌræ.təˈtu.i_) is a Rust crate for cooking up terminal user interfaces
(TUIs). It provides a simple and flexible way to create text-based user interfaces in the terminal,
which can be used for command-line applications, dashboards, and other interactive console programs.

## Quickstart

Ratatui has [templates] available to help you get started quickly. You can use the
[`cargo-generate`] command to create a new project with Ratatui:

```shell
cargo install --locked cargo-generate
cargo generate ratatui/templates
```

Selecting the Hello World template produces the following application:

```rust
use color_eyre::Result;
use crossterm::event::{self, Event};
use ratatui::{DefaultTerminal, Frame};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    color_eyre::install()?;
    let terminal = ratatui::init();
    let result = run(terminal);
    ratatui::restore();
    result
}

fn run(mut terminal: DefaultTerminal) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    loop {
        terminal.draw(render)?;
        if matches!(event::read()?, Event::Key(_)) {
            break Ok(());
        }
    }
}

fn render(frame: &amp;mut Frame) {
    frame.render_widget(&quot;hello world&quot;, frame.area());
}
```

## ⚓ Oxc

The Oxidation Compiler is creating a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Oxc is building a parser, linter, formatter, transformer, minifier, resolver ... all written in Rust.

See more at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs)!

## VoidZero Inc.

Oxc is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/blog).

If you have requirements for JavaScript tools at scale, please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/WQgjyzYJpwurpxWKA)!

## 🙋Who&#039;s using Oxc?

- [Rolldown] uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing and transformation.
- [Nova engine](https://trynova.dev) uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing.
- [Rolldown][rolldown], [Biome][biome] and [swc-node](https://github.com/swc-project/swc-node) uses the [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] crate for module resolution.
- Projects and companies like [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/4c20c23c16dd60f380ce9fe98afc93041a7e1562/oxlint.json), [Shopify](https://oxc.rs/blog/2023-12-12-announcing-oxlint.html#_50-100-times-faster-than-eslint), ByteDance and Shopee uses oxlint for linting.
- ...[and many more](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/projects.html)

## ⚡️ Linter Quick Start

The linter is ready to catch mistakes for you. It comes with 93 rules turned on by default (out of 430+ in total) and no configuration is required.

To get started, run [oxlint][npm-oxlint] or via `npx`:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds.

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## ⚡️ Performance

- The parser aims to be the fastest Rust-based ready-for-production parser.
- The linter is more than 50 times faster than [ESLint], and scales with the number of CPU cores.

&lt;/p&gt;

## ⌨️ Rust, Node.js and Wasm Usage

### Rust

Individual crates are published, you may use them to build your own JavaScript tools.

- The umbrella crate [oxc][docs-oxc-url] exports all public crates from this repository.
- The AST and parser crates [oxc_ast][docs-ast-url] and [oxc_parser][docs-parser-url] are production ready.
- The resolver crate [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] for module resolution is also production ready.
- Example usages of these crates can be found in their respective `crates/*/examples` directory.

While Rust has gained a reputation for its comparatively slower compilation speed,
we have dedicated significant effort to fine-tune the Rust compilation speed.
Our aim is to minimize any impact on your development workflow,
ensuring that developing your own Oxc based tools remains a smooth and efficient experience.

This is demonstrated by our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain),
where warm runs complete in 3 minutes.

### Node.js

- via napi: [oxc-parser][npm-napi-parser], [oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform]

### Wasm

- [@oxc-parser/wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-parser/wasm)

---

## 🎯 Tools

- [AST and Parser](#-ast-and-parser)
- [Linter](#-linter)
- [Resolver](#-resolver)
- [Minifier](#-minifier)
- [Formatter](#-formatter)
- [Transformer](#-transformer)

### 🔸 AST and Parser

Oxc maintains its own AST and parser, which is by far the fastest and most conformant JavaScript and TypeScript (including JSX and TSX) parser written in Rust.

As the parser often represents a key performance bottleneck in JavaScript tooling,
any minor improvements can have a cascading effect on our downstream tools.
By developing our parser, we have the opportunity to explore and implement well-researched performance techniques.

While many existing JavaScript tools rely on [estree] as their AST specification,
a notable drawback is its abundance of ambiguous nodes.
This ambiguity often leads to confusion during development with [estree].

The Oxc AST differs slightly from the [estree] AST by removing ambiguous nodes and introducing distinct types.
For example, instead of using a generic [estree] `Identifier`,
the Oxc AST provides specific types such as `BindingIdentifier`, `IdentifierReference`, and `IdentifierName`.
This clear distinction greatly enhances the development experience by aligning more closely with the ECMAScript specification.

#### 🏆 Parser Performance

Our [benchmark][parser-benchmark] reveals that the Oxc parser surpasses the speed of the [swc] parser by approximately 3 times and the [Biome][biome] parser by 5 times.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST is allocated in a memory arena (&lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/bumpalo&quot;&gt;bumpalo&lt;/a&gt;) for fast AST memory allocation and deallocation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Short strings are inlined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/compact_str&quot;&gt;CompactString&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No other heap allocations are done except the above two.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Scope binding, symbol resolution and some syntax errors are not done in the parser, they are delegated to the semantic analyzer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### 🔸 Linter

The linter embraces convention over configuration, eliminating the need for extensive configuration and plugin setup.
Unlike other linters like [ESLint], which often require intricate configurations and plugin installations (e.g. [@typescript-eslint]),
our linter only requires a single command that you can immediately run on your codebase:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

#### 🏆 Linter Performance

The linter is 50 - 100 times faster than [ESLint] depending on the number of rules and number of CPU cores used.
It completes in less than a second for most codebases with a few hundred files and completes in a few seconds for
larger monorepos. See [bench-javascript-linter](https://github.com/Boshen/bench-javascript-linter) for details.

As an upside, the binary is approximately 5MB, whereas [ESLint] and its associated plugin dependencies can easily exceed 100.

You may also download the linter binary from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest) as a standalone binary,
this lets you run the linter without a Node.js installation in your CI.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Oxc parser is used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST visit is a fast operation due to linear memory scan from the memory arena.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Files are linted in a multi-threaded environment, so scales with the total number of CPU cores.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Every single lint rule is tuned for performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### 🔸 Resolver

Module resolution plays a crucial role in JavaScript tooling, especially for tasks like multi-file analysis or bundling. However, it can often become a performance bottleneck.
To address this, we developed [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url].

The resolver is production-ready and is currently being used in [Rolldown][rolldown]. Usage and examples can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc_resolver).

### 🔸 Transformer

A transformer is responsible for turning higher versions of ECMAScript to a lower version that can be used in older browsers.

TypeScript and React transforms are complete. See [Milestone 2](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/2859) for current goals.

[oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform] can be used for experimentation.

### 🔸 Isolated Declarations

[TypeScript Isolated Declarations Emit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/#isolated-declarations) without using the TypeScript compiler.

Our [benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-transformer) indicates that our implementation is at least 20 times faster than the TypeScript compiler.

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) or [crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_isolated_declarations) can be used for this task.

### 🔸 Minifier

JavaScript minification plays a crucial role in optimizing website performance as it reduces the amount of data sent to users,
resulting in faster page loads.
This holds tremendous economic value, particularly for e-commerce websites, where every second can equate to millions of dollars.

However, existing minifiers typically require a trade-off between compression quality and speed.
You have to choose between the slowest for the best compression or the fastest for less compression.
But what if we could develop a faster minifier without compromising on compression?

We are actively working on a prototype that aims to achieve this goal,
by porting all test cases from well-known minifiers such as [google-closure-compiler], [terser], [esbuild], and [tdewolff-minify].

Preliminary results indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives.
With the Oxc minifier, you can expect faster minification times without sacrificing compression quality.

### 🔸 Formatter

While [prettier] has established itself as the de facto code formatter for JavaScript, there is a significant demand in the developer community for a less opinionated alternative. Recognizing this need, our ambition is to undertake research and development to create a new JavaScript formatter that offers increased flexibility and customization options.

The [prototype](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_formatter) is currently work in progress.

## 🧪Test Infrastructure

In Oxc, correctness and reliability are taken extremely seriously.

We spend half of our time on strengthening the test infrastructure to prevent problems from propagating to downstream tools.

[Test Infrastructure](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/architecture/test.html) documents our test procedures:

- Conformance suite on Test262, Babel, TypeScript
- Lots of fuzzing
- Linter snapshot diagnostics
- oxlint ecosystem ci
- Idempotency testing
- Code coverage
- End to end 3000 top npm packages
