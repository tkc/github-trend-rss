## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://x.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we use Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we&#039;ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:

-   We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    -   Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    -   Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://x.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
-   We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3, 2024, the last beta release.
-   We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4, 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
-   We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28, 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
-   We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) on June 20, 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and we do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth documentation](https://reth.rs/) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://reth.rs/docs/).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

-   Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
-   See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.88.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/06/26/Rust-1.88.0/).

See the docs for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://reth.rs/installation/source/).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [docs][book].

If the answer is not there:

-   Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or
-   Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or
-   Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-bug%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug.yml)

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

-   [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
-   [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
-   [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80). Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [📖 Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build:

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

**Spice** is a SQL query, search, and LLM-inference engine, written in Rust, for data apps and agents.

&lt;img width=&quot;740&quot; alt=&quot;Spice.ai Open Source accelerated data query and LLM-inference engine&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9db94f9c-10a1-47b0-ab45-05aa964590ff&quot; /&gt;

Spice provides four industry standard APIs in a lightweight, portable runtime (single binary/container):

1. **SQL Query &amp; Search**: HTTP, Arrow Flight, Arrow Flight SQL, ODBC, JDBC, and ADBC APIs; `vector_search` and `text_search` UDTFs.
2. **OpenAI-Compatible APIs**: HTTP APIs for OpenAI SDK compatibility, local model serving (CUDA/Metal accelerated), and hosted model gateway.
3. **Iceberg Catalog REST APIs**: A unified Iceberg REST Catalog API.
4. **MCP HTTP+SSE APIs**: Integration with external tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP) using HTTP and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

🎯 Goal: Developers can focus on building data apps and AI agents confidently, knowing they are grounded in data.

Spice&#039;s primary features include:

- **Data Federation**: SQL query across any database, data warehouse, or data lake. Deploy with single-node or distributed multi-node query execution. [Learn More](https://spiceai.org/docs/features/query-federation).
- **Data Materialization and Acceleration**: Materialize, accelerate, and cache database queries with Arrow, DuckDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, or Cayenne (Vortex+SQLite) for simplified multi-file acceleration. [Read the MaterializedView interview - Building a CDN for Databases](https://materializedview.io/p/building-a-cdn-for-databases-spice-ai)
- **Hybrid Search**: Keyword, vector, and full-text search with Tantivy-powered BM25 and petabyte-scale vector similarity search via Amazon S3 Vectors or pgvector for structured and unstructured data.
- **SQL LLM Inference**: Call LLMs directly from SQL. Generate, summarize, and enrich data using the Spice SQL AI function or Text-to-SQL. Use Spice as an AI-database powering retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and intelligent agents with OpenAI-compatible APIs and MCP integration. [Learn More](https://spiceai.org/docs/use-cases/rag).

If you want to build with DataFusion, DuckDB, or Vortex, Spice provides a simple, flexible, and production-ready engine you can just use.

📣 Read the [Spice.ai 1.0-stable announcement](https://spiceai.org/blog/announcing-1.0-stable).

Spice is built-on industry leading technologies including [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org), Apache Arrow, Arrow Flight, SQLite, and DuckDB.

## Why Spice?

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/96b5fcef-a550-4ce8-a74a-83931275e83e&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;Spice.ai&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/29e4421d-8942-4f2a-8397-e9d4fdeda36b&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Spice simplifies building data-driven AI applications and agents by making it fast and easy to query, federate, and accelerate data from one or more sources using SQL, while grounding AI in real-time, reliable data. Co-locate datasets with apps and AI models to power AI feedback loops, enable RAG and search, and deliver fast, low-latency data-query and AI-inference with full control over cost and performance.

### Latest Capabilities

- **Spice Cayenne Data Accelerator (Beta)**: Simplified multi-file acceleration using the [Vortex columnar format](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex) + SQLite metadata. Delivers DuckDB-comparable performance without single-file scaling limitations.
- **Multi-Node Distributed Query (Preview)**: Scale query execution across multiple nodes with Apache Ballista integration for improved performance on large datasets.
- **Acceleration Snapshots**: Bootstrap accelerations from S3 for fast cold starts (seconds vs. minutes). Supports ephemeral storage with persistent recovery.
- **Iceberg Table Writes**: Write to Iceberg tables using standard SQL `INSERT INTO` for data ingestion and transformation—no Spark required.
- **Petabyte-Scale Vector Search**: Native Amazon S3 Vectors integration manages the full vector lifecycle from ingestion to embedding to querying. SQL-integrated hybrid search with RRF.

### How is Spice different?

1. **AI-Native Runtime**: Spice combines data query and AI inference in a single engine, for data-grounded AI and accurate AI.

2. **Application-Focused**: Designed to run distributed at the application and agent level, often as a 1:1 or 1:N mapping between app and Spice instance, unlike traditional data systems built for many apps on one centralized database. It’s common to spin up multiple Spice instances—even one per tenant or customer.

3. **Dual-Engine Acceleration**: Supports both **OLAP** (Arrow/DuckDB) and **OLTP** (SQLite/PostgreSQL) engines at the dataset level, providing flexible performance across analytical and transactional workloads.

4. **Disaggregated Storage**: Separation of compute from disaggregated storage, co-locating local, materialized working sets of data with applications, dashboards, or ML pipelines while accessing source data in its original storage.

5. **Edge to Cloud Native**: Deploy as a standalone instance, Kubernetes sidecar, microservice, or cluster—across edge/POP, on-prem, and public clouds. Chain multiple Spice instances for tier-optimized, distributed deployments.

## FAQ

- **Is Spice a cache?** No specifically; you can think of Spice data acceleration as an _active_ cache, materialization, or data prefetcher. A cache would fetch data on a cache-miss while Spice prefetches and materializes filtered data on an interval, trigger, or as data changes using CDC. In addition to acceleration Spice supports [results caching](https://spiceai.org/docs/features/caching).

- **Is Spice a CDN for databases?** Yes, a common use-case for Spice is as a CDN for different data sources. Using CDN concepts, Spice enables you to ship (load) a working set of your database (or data lake, or data warehouse) where it&#039;s most frequently accessed, like from a data-intensive application or for AI context.

| **Edge &amp; IoT** | **Strong Edge Support**&lt;br&gt;Ideal for secure, innovative edge devices. | **Weak Edge Support**&lt;br&gt;Often too heavy for edge gateways. |
| **Risk Profile** | **Enterprise Risk Mitigation**&lt;br&gt;Clear IP rights and safe for commercial use. | **Legal Risks**&lt;br&gt;Intellectual property ambiguity and usage restrictions. |


## Staying ahead

Star RustFS on GitHub and be instantly notified of new releases.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee40bb4-3e46-4eac-b0d0-5fbeb85ff8f3&quot; /&gt;

## Quickstart

To get started with RustFS, follow these steps:

### 1. One-click Installation (Option 1)

  ```bash
  curl -O https://rustfs.com/install_rustfs.sh &amp;&amp; bash install_rustfs.sh
````

### 2\. Docker Quick Start (Option 2)

The RustFS container runs as a non-root user `rustfs` (UID `10001`). If you run Docker with `-v` to mount a host directory, please ensure the host directory owner is set to `10001`, otherwise you will encounter permission denied errors.

```bash
 # Create data and logs directories
 mkdir -p data logs

 # Change the owner of these directories
 chown -R 10001:10001 data logs

 # Using latest version
 docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:latest

 # Using specific version
 docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:1.0.0-alpha.76
```

You can also use Docker Compose. Using the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory:

```bash
docker compose --profile observability up -d
```

**NOTE**: We recommend reviewing the `docker-compose.yaml` file before running. It defines several services including Grafana, Prometheus, and Jaeger, which are helpful for RustFS observability. If you wish to start Redis or Nginx containers, you can specify the corresponding profiles.

### 3\. Build from Source (Option 3) - Advanced Users

For developers who want to build RustFS Docker images from source with multi-architecture support:

```bash
# Build multi-architecture images locally
./docker-buildx.sh --build-arg RELEASE=latest

# Build and push to registry
./docker-buildx.sh --push

# Build specific version
./docker-buildx.sh --release v1.0.0 --push

# Build for custom registry
./docker-buildx.sh --registry your-registry.com --namespace yourname --push
```

The `docker-buildx.sh` script supports:
\- **Multi-architecture builds**: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
\- **Automatic version detection**: Uses git tags or commit hashes
\- **Registry flexibility**: Supports Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.
\- **Build optimization**: Includes caching and parallel builds

You can also use Make targets for convenience:

```bash
make docker-buildx                    # Build locally
make docker-buildx-push               # Build and push
make docker-buildx-version VERSION=v1.0.0  # Build specific version
make help-docker                      # Show all Docker-related commands
```

&gt; **Heads-up (macOS cross-compilation)**: macOS keeps the default `ulimit -n` at 256, so `cargo zigbuild` or `./build-rustfs.sh --platform ...` may fail with `ProcessFdQuotaExceeded` when targeting Linux. The build script attempts to raise the limit automatically, but if you still see the warning, run `ulimit -n 4096` (or higher) in your shell before building.

### 4\. Build with Helm Chart (Option 4) - Cloud Native

Follow the instructions in the [Helm Chart README](https://charts.rustfs.com/) to install RustFS on a Kubernetes cluster.

### 5\. Nix Flake (Option 5)

If you have [Nix with flakes enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes):

```bash
# Run directly without installing
nix run github:rustfs/rustfs

# Build the binary
nix build github:rustfs/rustfs
./result/bin/rustfs --help

# Or from a local checkout
nix build
nix run
```

# Tempo

The blockchain for payments at scale.

[Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/) is a blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments. Its architecture focuses on high throughput, low cost, and features that financial institutions, payment service providers, and fintech platforms expect from modern payment infrastructure.

You can get started today by integrating with the [Tempo testnet](https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/integrate-tempo), [building on Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/guide/use-accounts), [running a Tempo node](https://docs.tempo.xyz/guide/node), reading the [Tempo protocol specs](https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol) or by [building with Tempo SDKs](https://docs.tempo.xyz/sdk).

## What makes Tempo different

- [TIP‑20 token standard](https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol/tip20/overview) (enshrined ERC‑20 extensions)

  - Predictable payment throughput via dedicated payment lanes reserved for TIP‑20 transfers (eliminates noisy‑neighbor contention).
  - Native reconciliation with on‑transfer memos and commitment patterns (hash/locator) for off‑chain PII and large data.
  - Built‑in compliance through [TIP‑403 Policy Registry](https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol/tip403/overview): single policy shared across multiple tokens, updated once and enforced everywhere.

- Low, predictable fees in [stablecoins](https://docs.tempo.xyz/learn/stablecoins)

  - Users pay gas directly in USD-stablecoins at launch; the [Fee AMM](https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol/fees/fee-amm#fee-amm-overview) automatically converts to the validator’s preferred stablecoin.
  - TIP‑20 transfers target sub‑millidollar costs (&lt;$0.001).

- [Tempo Transactions](https://docs.tempo.xyz/guide/tempo-transaction) (native “smart accounts”)

  - Batched payments: atomic multi‑operation payouts (payroll, settlements, refunds).
  - Fee sponsorship: apps can pay users&#039; gas to streamline onboarding and flows.
  - Scheduled payments: protocol‑level time windows for recurring and timed disbursements.
  - Modern authentication: passkeys via WebAuthn/P256 (biometric sign‑in, secure enclave, cross‑device sync).

- Performance and finality

  - Built on the [Reth SDK](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), the most performant and flexible EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) execution client.
  - Simplex Consensus (via [Commonware](https://commonware.xyz/)): fast, sub‑second finality in normal conditions; graceful degradation under adverse networks.

- Coming soon

  - On‑chain FX and non‑USD stablecoin support for direct on‑chain liquidity; pay fees in more currencies.
  - Native private token standard: opt‑in privacy for balances/transfers coexisting with issuer compliance and auditability.

## What makes Tempo familiar

- Fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), targeting the Osaka hardfork.
- Deploy and interact with smart contracts using the same tools, languages, and frameworks used on Ethereum, such as Solidity, Foundry, and Hardhat.
- All Ethereum JSON-RPC methods work out of the box.

While the execution environment mirrors Ethereum&#039;s, Tempo introduces some differences optimized for payments, described [here](https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/evm-compatibility).

## Getting Started

### As a user

You can connect to Tempo&#039;s public testnet using the following details:

| Property           | Value                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Network Name**   | Tempo Testnet (Moderato)           |
| **Currency**       | `USD`                              |
| **Chain ID**       | `42431`                            |
| **HTTP URL**       | `https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz`   |
| **WebSocket URL**  | `wss://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz`     |
| **Block Explorer** | `https://explore.tempo.xyz`        |

Next, grab some stablecoins to test with from Tempo&#039;s [Faucet](https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/faucet#faucet).

## API

The core API is only 4 functions (run our [💡 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing)):

```python
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection(&quot;all-my-documents&quot;)

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=[&quot;This is document1&quot;, &quot;This is document2&quot;], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;notion&quot;}, {&quot;source&quot;: &quot;google-docs&quot;}], # filter on these!
    ids=[&quot;doc1&quot;, &quot;doc2&quot;], # unique for each doc
)

# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=[&quot;This is a query document&quot;],
    n_results=2,
    # where={&quot;metadata_field&quot;: &quot;is_equal_to_this&quot;}, # optional filter
    # where_document={&quot;$contains&quot;:&quot;search_string&quot;}  # optional filter
)
```

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Alloy

Alloy connects applications to blockchains.

Alloy is a rewrite of [`ethers-rs`] from the ground up, with exciting new
features, high performance, and excellent [docs](https://docs.rs/alloy).

We also have a [book](https://alloy.rs/) on all things Alloy and many [examples](https://github.com/alloy-rs/examples) to help you get started.

[![Telegram chat][telegram-badge]][telegram-url]

[telegram-url]: https://t.me/ethers_rs

## Installation

Alloy consists of a number of crates that provide a range of functionality essential for interfacing with any Ethereum-based blockchain.

The easiest way to get started is to add the `alloy` crate with the `full` feature flag from the command-line using Cargo:

```sh
cargo add alloy --features full
```

Alternatively, you can add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
alloy = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```

For a more fine-grained control over the features you wish to include, you can add the individual crates to your `Cargo.toml` file, or use the `alloy` crate with the features you need.

A comprehensive list of available features can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/alloy/latest/features) or in the [`alloy` crate&#039;s `Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/blob/main/crates/alloy/Cargo.toml).

## Examples

### Connecting to a Provider

Here&#039;s a simple example of connecting to an Ethereum node and querying the latest block:

```rust
use alloy::providers::{Provider, ProviderBuilder};

# async fn example() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
// Create a provider with the HTTP transport using the `reqwest` crate.
let rpc_url = &quot;https://eth.llamarpc.com&quot;;
let provider = ProviderBuilder::new().connect(rpc_url).await?;

// Get the latest block number.
let latest_block = provider.get_block_number().await?;
println!(&quot;Latest block number: {latest_block}&quot;);

// Get chain ID.
let chain_id = provider.get_chain_id().await?;
println!(&quot;Chain ID: {chain_id}&quot;);
# Ok(())
# }

### Network generic

Alloy is network-generic, allowing you to work with any Ethereum-compatible chain. Here&#039;s an example using Optimism (see [`op-alloy`](https://docs.rs/op-alloy)) to demonstrate this capability:

```rust,ignore
use alloy::providers::{Provider, ProviderBuilder};
use op_alloy::network::Optimism;

# async fn example() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
// Connect to Optimism mainnet.
let rpc_url = &quot;https://mainnet.optimism.io&quot;;
let provider = ProviderBuilder::new_with_network::&lt;Optimism&gt;().connect(rpc_url).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

For more examples, check out the [Alloy examples repository](https://github.com/alloy-rs/examples).

## Supported Rust Versions (MSRV)

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
--&gt;

The current MSRV (minimum supported rust version) is 1.88.

Alloy will keep a rolling MSRV policy of **at least** two versions behind the
latest stable release (so if the latest stable release is 1.58, we would
support 1.56).

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a patch
(pre-1.0) or minor (post-1.0) release.

## Contributing

Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have you! We have
[a contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you get involved in the
Alloy project.

Pull requests will not be merged unless CI passes, so please ensure that your
contribution follows the linting rules and passes clippy.

## Note on `no_std`

Because these crates are primarily network-focused, we do not intend to support
`no_std` for most of them at this time.

The following crates support `no_std`:

| Crate               | Version Badge                                                                                                 |

| **alloy-eips**      | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/alloy-eips.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-eips)           |
| **alloy-genesis**   | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/alloy-genesis.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-genesis)     |
| **alloy-serde**     | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/alloy-serde.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-serde)         |
| **alloy-consensus** | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/alloy-consensus.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-consensus) |

If you would like to add `no_std` support to a crate, please make sure to update
`scripts/check_no_std.sh` as well.

uv is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty).

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12 3.13 3.14
Installed 3 versions in 972ms
 + cpython-3.12.12-macos-aarch64-none (python3.12)
 + cpython-3.13.9-macos-aarch64-none (python3.13)
 + cpython-3.14.0-macos-aarch64-none (python3.14)

```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

```

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

**v3.6 Refactoring**

- Backend: 5-phase refactoring (error handling → command split → tests → services → concurrency)
- Frontend: 4-stage refactoring (test infra → hooks → components → cleanup)
- Testing: 100% hooks coverage + integration tests (vitest + MSW)

# Pixi: Package Management Made Easy

## Overview

`pixi` is a cross-platform, multi-language package manager and workflow tool built on the foundation of the conda ecosystem. It provides developers with an exceptional experience similar to popular package managers like [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) or [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com), but for any language.

Developed with ❤️ at [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).
[![Real-time pixi_demo](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/assets/12893423/0fc8f8c8-ac13-4c14-891b-dc613f25475b)](https://asciinema.org/a/636482)

## Highlights

- Supports **multiple languages** including Python, C++, and R using Conda packages. You can find available packages on [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).
- Compatible with all major operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS (including Apple Silicon).
- Always includes an up-to-date [**lock file**](https://pixi.sh/latest/workspace/lockfile/).
- Provides a clean and simple Cargo-like **command-line interface**.
- Allows you to install tools **per-project** or **system-wide**.
- Entirely written in **Rust** and built on top of the **[rattler](https://github.com/conda/rattler)** library.

## Getting Started

- ⚙️ [Examples](/examples)
- 📚 [Documentation](https://pixi.sh/)
- 😍 [Contributing](#contributing)
- 🔨 [Built using Pixi](#built-using-pixi)
- 🚀 [GitHub Action](https://github.com/prefix-dev/setup-pixi)

## Status

Pixi is ready for production!
We are working hard to keep file-format changes compatible with the previous
versions so that you can rely on Pixi with peace of mind.

Some notable features we envision for upcoming releases are:

- **Build and publish** your project as a Conda package.
- Support for **dependencies from source**.
- More powerful &quot;global installation&quot; of packages towards a deterministic setup of global packages on multiple machines.

## Installation

`pixi` can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The provided scripts will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `~/.pixi/bin`. If this directory does not exist, the script will create it.

### macOS and Linux

To install Pixi on macOS and Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
# or with brew
brew install pixi
```

The script will also update your `~/.bashrc` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your `PATH`, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.
You might need to restart your terminal or source your shell for the changes to take effect.

Starting with macOS Catalina [zsh is the default login shell and interactive shell](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102360). Therefore, you might want to use `zsh` instead of `bash` in the install command:

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | zsh
```

The script will also update your `~/.zshrc` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your `PATH`, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.

### Windows

To install Pixi on Windows, open a PowerShell terminal (you may need to run it as an administrator) and run the following command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```
Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.
Check the script you would be running with:
```powershell
powershell -c &quot;irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | more&quot;
```

The script will inform you once the installation is successful and add the `~/.pixi/bin` directory to your `PATH`, which will allow you to run the `pixi` command from any location.
Or with `winget`

```shell
winget install prefix-dev.pixi
```

### Autocompletion

To get autocompletion follow the instructions for your shell.
Afterwards, restart the shell or source the shell config file.

#### Bash (default on most Linux systems)

Add the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

eval &quot;$(pixi completion --shell bash)&quot;
```
#### Zsh (default on macOS)

Add the following to the end of `~/.zshrc`:


```zsh
# ~/.zshrc

eval &quot;$(pixi completion --shell zsh)&quot;
```

#### PowerShell (pre-installed on all Windows systems)

Add the following to the end of `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.
You can check the location of this file by querying the `$PROFILE` variable in PowerShell.
Typically the path is `~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` or
`~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` on -Nix.

```pwsh
(&amp; pixi completion --shell powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

#### Fish

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

pixi completion --shell fish | source
```

#### Nushell

Add the following to your Nushell config file (find it by running `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):

```nushell
mkdir $&quot;($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload&quot;
pixi completion --shell nushell | save --force $&quot;($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload/pixi-completions.nu&quot;
```

#### Elvish

Add the following to the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:

```elv
# ~/.elvish/rc.elv

eval (pixi completion --shell elvish | slurp)
```

### Distro Packages

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pixi.svg)](https://repology.org/project/pixi/versions)

#### Arch Linux

You can install `pixi` from the [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pixi/) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):

```shell
pacman -S pixi
```

#### Alpine Linux

`pixi` is available for [Alpine Edge](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=pixi&amp;branch=edge). It can be installed via [apk](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Package_Keeper) after enabling the [testing repository](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories).

```shell
apk add pixi
```

## Build/install from source

`pixi` is 100% written in Rust and therefore it can be installed, built and tested with cargo.
To start using `pixi` from a source build run:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git pixi
```

We don&#039;t publish to `crates.io` anymore, so you need to install it from the repository.
The reason for this is that we depend on some unpublished crates which disallows us to publish to `crates.io`.

or when you want to make changes use:

```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

If you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout
it&#039;s [compile steps](https://github.com/conda/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)

## Uninstall

To uninstall, the Pixi binary should be removed.
Delete `pixi` from the `$PIXI_DIR` which is default to `~/.pixi/bin/pixi`

So on Linux its:

```shell
rm ~/.pixi/bin/pixi
```

and on Windows:

```shell
$PIXI_BIN = &quot;$Env:LocalAppData\pixi\bin\pixi&quot;; Remove-Item -Path $PIXI_BIN
```

After this command you can still use the tools you installed with `pixi`.
To remove these as well just remove the whole `~/.pixi` directory and remove the directory from your path.

# Usage

```bash
pixi run cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
```

Activate a shell in the environment

```shell
pixi shell
cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
exit
```

Check out https://pixi.sh/dev/first_workspace/ for a more detailed introduction to workspaces.

## Installing a conda package globally

You can also globally install conda packages into their own environment.
This behavior is similar to [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) or [`condax`](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk/condax).

```bash
pixi global install cowpy
```

## Use in GitHub Actions

You can use Pixi in GitHub Actions to install dependencies and run commands.
It supports automatic caching of your environments.

```yml
- uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
- run: pixi exec cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
```

See the [documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/advanced/github_actions) for more details.

&gt; 🚧 **Beta Software**
&gt;
&gt; Rolldown is currently in beta status. While it can already handle most production use cases, there may still be bugs and rough edges. Most notably, the built-in minification feature is still in alpha status.

# Rolldown

Rolldown is a JavaScript/TypeScript bundler written in Rust intended to serve as the future bundler used in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It provides Rollup-compatible APIs and plugin interface, but will be more similar to esbuild in scope.

For more information, please check out the documentation at [rolldown.rs](https://rolldown.rs/guide/getting-started).

## VoidZero Inc.

Rolldown is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc).

TiKV is an open-source, distributed, and transactional key-value database. Unlike other traditional NoSQL systems, TiKV not only provides classical key-value APIs, but also transactional APIs with ACID compliance. Built in Rust and powered by Raft, TiKV was originally created by [PingCAP](https://en.pingcap.com) to complement [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb), a distributed HTAP database compatible with the MySQL protocol.

The design of TiKV (&#039;Ti&#039; stands for titanium) is inspired by some great distributed systems from Google, such as BigTable, Spanner, and Percolator, and some of the latest achievements in academia in recent years, such as the Raft consensus algorithm.

If you&#039;re interested in contributing to TiKV, or want to build it from source, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

TiKV is a graduated project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who&#039;s involved and how TiKV plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/09/02/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-tikv-graduation/).

---

With the implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust and consensus state stored in RocksDB, TiKV guarantees data consistency. [Placement Driver (PD)](https://github.com/pingcap/pd/), which is introduced to implement auto-sharding, enables automatic data migration. The transaction model is similar to Google&#039;s Percolator with some performance improvements. TiKV also provides snapshot isolation (SI), snapshot isolation with lock (SQL: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), and externally consistent reads and writes in distributed transactions.

TiKV has the following key features:

- **Geo-Replication**

    TiKV uses [Raft](http://raft.github.io/) and the Placement Driver to support Geo-Replication.

- **Horizontal scalability**

    With PD and carefully designed Raft groups, TiKV excels in horizontal scalability and can easily scale to 100+ TBs of data.

- **Consistent distributed transactions**

    Similar to Google&#039;s Spanner, TiKV supports externally-consistent distributed transactions.

- **Coprocessor support**

    Similar to HBase, TiKV implements a coprocessor framework to support distributed computing.

- **Cooperates with [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb)**

    Thanks to the internal optimization, TiKV and TiDB can work together to be a compelling database solution with high horizontal scalability, externally-consistent transactions, support for RDBMS, and NoSQL design patterns.

## TiKV software stack

![The TiKV software stack](images/tikv_stack.png)

- **Placement Driver:** PD is the cluster manager of TiKV, which periodically checks replication constraints to balance load and data automatically.
- **Store:** There is a RocksDB within each Store and it stores data into the local disk.
- **Region:** Region is the basic unit of Key-Value data movement. Each Region is replicated to multiple Nodes. These multiple replicas form a Raft group.
- **Node:** A physical node in the cluster. Within each node, there are one or more Stores. Within each Store, there are many Regions.

When a node starts, the metadata of the Node, Store and Region are recorded into PD. The status of each Region and Store is reported to PD regularly.

## Quick start

### Deploy a playground with TiUP

The most quickest to try out TiKV with TiDB is using TiUP, a component manager for TiDB.

You can see [this page](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/quick-start-with-tidb#deploy-a-local-test-environment-using-tiup-playground) for a step by step tutorial.

### Deploy a playground with binary

TiKV is able to run separately with PD, which is the minimal deployment required.

1. Download and extract binaries.

```bash
$ export TIKV_VERSION=v7.5.0
$ export GOOS=darwin  # only {darwin, linux} are supported
$ export GOARCH=amd64 # only {amd64, arm64} are supported
$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
```

2. Start PD instance.

```bash
$ ./pd-server --name=pd --data-dir=/tmp/pd/data --client-urls=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:2379&quot; --peer-urls=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:2380&quot; --initial-cluster=&quot;pd=http://127.0.0.1:2380&quot; --log-file=/tmp/pd/log/pd.log
```

3. Start TiKV instance.

```bash
$ ./tikv-server --pd-endpoints=&quot;127.0.0.1:2379&quot; --addr=&quot;127.0.0.1:20160&quot; --data-dir=/tmp/tikv/data --log-file=/tmp/tikv/log/tikv.log
```

4. Install TiKV Client(Python) and verify the deployment, required Python 3.5+.

```bash
$ pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ tikv-client
```

```python
from tikv_client import RawClient

client = RawClient.connect([&quot;127.0.0.1:2379&quot;])

client.put(b&#039;foo&#039;, b&#039;bar&#039;)
print(client.get(b&#039;foo&#039;)) # b&#039;bar&#039;

client.put(b&#039;foo&#039;, b&#039;baz&#039;)
print(client.get(b&#039;foo&#039;)) # b&#039;baz&#039;
```

### Deploy a cluster with Docker Compose

The easiest way to run a complete TiKV cluster (3 PD + 3 TiKV nodes) for development and testing is using Docker Compose. The setup uses pre-built TiKV and PD nightly images from Docker Hub, so no building is required.

&gt; **Note:** On macOS, use `docker compose` (space) instead of `docker-compose` (hyphen) in all commands.

1. Start the cluster:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
# On macOS, use: docker compose up -d
```

2. Check cluster status:

```bash
$ docker-compose ps
# On macOS, use: docker compose ps
```

3. Access the cluster:

- PD endpoints: `127.0.0.1:23791`, `127.0.0.1:23792`, `127.0.0.1:23793`
- TiKV status: `http://localhost:20181/status`, `http://localhost:20182/status`, `http://localhost:20183/status`

For more details, see [docker-compose.README.md](./docker-compose.README.md).

### Deploy a cluster with TiUP

You can see [this manual](./doc/deploy.md) of production-like cluster deployment presented by @c4pt0r.

An ergonomic, batteries-included HTTP Client for Rust.

- Async and blocking `Client`s
- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- Customizable redirect policy
- HTTP Proxies
- HTTPS via rustls (or optionally, system-native TLS)
- Cookie Store
- WASM


## Example

This asynchronous example uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) and enables some
optional features, so your `Cargo.toml` could look like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = &quot;0.13&quot;, features = [&quot;json&quot;] }
tokio = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```

And then the code:

```rust,no_run
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let resp = reqwest::get(&quot;https://httpbin.org/ip&quot;)
        .await?
        .json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;()
        .await?;
    println!(&quot;{resp:#?}&quot;);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Commercial Support

For private advice, support, reviews, access to the maintainer, and the like, reach out for [commercial support][sponsor].

## Requirements

By default, Reqwest uses [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls), but when the `native-tls` feature is enabled
it will use the operating system TLS framework if available, meaning Windows and macOS.
On Linux, it will use the available OpenSSL (see https://docs.rs/openssl for supported versions and more details)
or fail to build if not found. Alternatively you can enable the `native-tls-vendored` feature to compile a copy of OpenSSL.

&lt;!-- description:start --&gt;
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the
language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.

*prek* is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust.
It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it,
while also providing some additional long-requested features.
&lt;!-- description:end --&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Although prek is pretty new, it’s already powering real‑world projects like [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi), and more projects are picking it up—see [Who is using prek?](#who-is-using-prek). If you’re looking for an alternative to `pre-commit`, please give it a try—we’d love your feedback!
&gt;
&gt; Please note that some subcommands and languages are still missing for full drop‑in parity with `pre-commit`. Track the remaining gaps here: [TODO](https://prek.j178.dev/todo/).

&lt;!-- features:start --&gt;
## Features

- 🚀 A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- ⚡ [Faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and more efficient in disk space usage.
- 🔄 Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- 🏗️ Built-in support for monorepos (i.e. [workspace mode](https://prek.j178.dev/workspace/)).
- 🐍 Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- 🛠️ Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- 📦 [Built-in](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/) Rust-native implementation of some common hooks.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;!-- github-actions:start --&gt;
prek can be used in GitHub Actions via the [j178/prek-action](https://github.com/j178/prek-action) repository.

Example workflow:

```yaml
name: Prek checks
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  prek:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: j178/prek-action@v1
```

This action installs prek and runs `prek run --all-files` on your repository.

prek is also available via [`taiki-e/install-action`](https://github.com/taiki-e/install-action) for installing various tools.
&lt;!-- github-actions:end --&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;!-- self-update:start --&gt;
If installed via the standalone installer, prek can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
prek self update
```
&lt;!-- self-update:end --&gt;

## Quick start

- **I already use pre-commit:** follow the short migration checklist in the [quickstart guide](https://prek.j178.dev/quickstart/#already-using-pre-commit) to swap in `prek` safely.
- **I&#039;m new to pre-commit-style tools:** learn the basics—creating a config, running hooks, and installing git hooks—in the [beginner quickstart walkthrough](https://prek.j178.dev/quickstart/#new-to-pre-commit-style-workflows).

&lt;!-- why:start --&gt;
## Why prek?

### prek is faster

- It is [multiple times faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and takes up half the disk space.
- It redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.
- Repositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.
- Hooks can run in parallel by priority (hooks with the same [`priority`](https://prek.j178.dev/configuration/#priority) may run concurrently), reducing end-to-end runtime.
- It uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.
- It implements some common hooks in Rust, [built in prek](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/), which are faster than their Python counterparts.
- It supports `repo: builtin` for offline, zero-setup hooks, which is not available in `pre-commit`.

### prek provides a better user experience

- No need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.
- No hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.
- Built-in support for [workspaces](https://prek.j178.dev/workspace/) (or monorepos), each subproject can have its own `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
- [`prek run`](https://prek.j178.dev/cli/#prek-run) has some nifty improvements over `pre-commit run`, such as:
  - `prek run --directory &lt;dir&gt;` runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use `git ls-files -- &lt;dir&gt; | xargs pre-commit run --files` anymore.
  - `prek run --last-commit` runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.
  - `prek run [HOOK] [HOOK]` selects and runs multiple hooks.
- [`prek list`](https://prek.j178.dev/cli/#prek-list) command lists all available hooks, their ids, and descriptions, providing a better overview of the configured hooks.
- [`prek auto-update`](https://prek.j178.dev/cli/#prek-auto-update) supports `--cooldown-days` to mitigate open source supply chain attacks.
- prek provides shell completions for `prek run &lt;hook_id&gt;` command, making it easier to run specific hooks without remembering their ids.

For more detailed improvements prek offers, take a look at [Difference from pre-commit](https://prek.j178.dev/diff/).

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn&#039;t be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I&#039;ve learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.

---

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).

&lt;hr /&gt;

Lance is an open lakehouse format for multimodal AI. It contains a file format, table format, and catalog spec that allows you to build a complete lakehouse on top of object storage to power your AI workflows. Lance is perfect for:

1. Building search engines and feature stores with hybrid search capabilities.
2. Large-scale ML training requiring high performance IO and random access.
3. Storing, querying, and managing multimodal data including images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings.

The key features of Lance include:

* **Expressive hybrid search:** Combine vector similarity search, full-text search (BM25), and SQL analytics on the same dataset with accelerated secondary indices.

* **Lightning-fast random access:** 100x faster than Parquet or Iceberg for random access without sacrificing scan performance.

* **Native multimodal data support:** Store images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings in a single unified format with efficient blob encoding and lazy loading.

* **Data evolution:** Efficiently add columns with backfilled values without full table rewrites, perfect for ML feature engineering.

* **Zero-copy versioning:** ACID transactions, time travel, and automatic versioning without needing extra infrastructure.

* **Rich ecosystem integrations:** Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Apache Spark, Ray, Trino, Apache Flink, and open catalogs (Apache Polaris, Unity Catalog, Apache Gravitino).

For more details, see the full [Lance format specification](https://lance.org/format).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Lance is in active development and we welcome contributions. Please see our [contributing guide](https://lance.org/community/contributing/) for more information.

## Quick Start

**Installation**

```shell
pip install pylance
```

To install a preview release:

```shell
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lance-format/pylance
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; For versions prior to 1.0.0-beta.4, you can find them at https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/pylance

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Preview releases are released more often than full releases and contain the
&gt; latest features and bug fixes. They receive the same level of testing as full releases.
&gt; We guarantee they will remain published and available for download for at
&gt; least 6 months. When you want to pin to a specific version, prefer a stable release.

**Converting to Lance**

```python
import lance

import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.dataset

df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;a&quot;: [5], &quot;b&quot;: [10]})
uri = &quot;/tmp/test.parquet&quot;
tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
pa.dataset.write_dataset(tbl, uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)

parquet = pa.dataset.dataset(uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)
lance.write_dataset(parquet, &quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
```

**Reading Lance data**
```python
dataset = lance.dataset(&quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
assert isinstance(dataset, pa.dataset.Dataset)
```

**Pandas**
```python
df = dataset.to_table().to_pandas()
df
```

**DuckDB**
```python
import duckdb

# If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM dataset LIMIT 10&quot;).to_df()
```

**Vector search**

Download the sift1m subset

```shell
wget ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz
tar -xzf sift.tar.gz
```

Convert it to Lance

```python
import lance
from lance.vector import vec_to_table
import numpy as np
import struct

nvecs = 1000000
ndims = 128
with open(&quot;sift/sift_base.fvecs&quot;, mode=&quot;rb&quot;) as fobj:
    buf = fobj.read()
    data = np.array(struct.unpack(&quot;&lt;128000000f&quot;, buf[4 : 4 + 4 * nvecs * ndims])).reshape((nvecs, ndims))
    dd = dict(zip(range(nvecs), data))

table = vec_to_table(dd)
uri = &quot;vec_data.lance&quot;
sift1m = lance.write_dataset(table, uri, max_rows_per_group=8192, max_rows_per_file=1024*1024)
```

Build the index

```python
sift1m.create_index(&quot;vector&quot;,
                    index_type=&quot;IVF_PQ&quot;,
                    num_partitions=256,  # IVF
                    num_sub_vectors=16)  # PQ
```

Search the dataset

```python
# Get top 10 similar vectors
import duckdb

dataset = lance.dataset(uri)

# Sample 100 query vectors. If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
sample = duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT vector FROM dataset USING SAMPLE 100&quot;).to_df()
query_vectors = np.array([np.array(x) for x in sample.vector])

# Get nearest neighbors for all of them
rs = [dataset.to_table(nearest={&quot;column&quot;: &quot;vector&quot;, &quot;k&quot;: 10, &quot;q&quot;: q})
      for q in query_vectors]
```

## Benchmarks

### Vector search

We used the SIFT dataset to benchmark our results with 1M vectors of 128D

1. For 100 randomly sampled query vectors, we get &lt;1ms average response time (on a 2023 m2 MacBook Air)

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/avg_latency.png)

2. ANNs are always a trade-off between recall and performance

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/recall_vs_latency.png)

### Vs. parquet

We create a Lance dataset using the Oxford Pet dataset to do some preliminary performance testing of Lance as compared to Parquet and raw image/XMLs. For analytics queries, Lance is 50-100x better than reading the raw metadata. For batched random access, Lance is 100x better than both parquet and raw files.

## Why Lance for AI/ML workflows?

The machine learning development cycle involves multiple stages:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --&gt; B[Exploration];
    B --&gt; C[Analytics];
    C --&gt; D[Feature Engineer];
    D --&gt; E[Training];
    E --&gt; F[Evaluation];
    F --&gt; C;
    E --&gt; G[Deployment];
    G --&gt; H[Monitoring];
    H --&gt; A;
```

Traditional lakehouse formats were designed for SQL analytics and struggle with AI/ML workloads that require:
- **Vector search** for similarity and semantic retrieval
- **Fast random access** for sampling and interactive exploration
- **Multimodal data** storage (images, videos, audio alongside embeddings)
- **Data evolution** for feature engineering without full table rewrites
- **Hybrid search** combining vectors, full-text, and SQL predicates

While existing formats (Parquet, Iceberg, Delta Lake) excel at SQL analytics, they require additional specialized systems for AI capabilities. Lance brings these AI-first features directly into the lakehouse format.

A comparison of different formats across ML development stages:

|                     | Lance | Parquet &amp; ORC | JSON &amp; XML | TFRecord | Database | Warehouse |
|---------------------|-------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Analytics           | Fast  | Fast          | Slow       | Slow     | Decent   | Fast      |
| Feature Engineering | Fast  | Fast          | Decent     | Slow     | Decent   | Good      |
| Training            | Fast  | Decent        | Slow       | Fast     | N/A      | N/A       |
| Exploration         | Fast  | Slow          | Fast       | Slow     | Fast     | Decent    |
| Infra Support       | Rich  | Rich          | Decent     | Limited  | Rich     | Rich      |

## Prerequisites

See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for software requirements to develop in this repo.

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX
```

Enable logs for user applications:

```bash
export LINERA_APPLICATION_LOGS=true
```

Set the path of the future wallet:

```bash
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[1]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[1]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;
```

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.
