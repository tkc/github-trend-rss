**Burn is a next generation Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on &lt;br /&gt;
flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

## Performance

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-blazingly-fast.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Because we believe the goal of a deep learning framework is to convert computation into useful
intelligence, we have made performance a core pillar of Burn. We strive to achieve top efficiency by
leveraging multiple optimization techniques described below.

**Click on each section for more details** üëá

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel fusion üí•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Using Burn means having your models optimized on any backend. When possible, we provide a way to
automatically and dynamically create custom kernels that minimize data relocation between different
memory spaces, extremely useful when moving memory is the bottleneck.

As an example, you could write your own GELU activation function with the high level tensor api (see
Rust code snippet below).

```rust
fn gelu_custom&lt;B: Backend, const D: usize&gt;(x: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
    let x = x.clone() * ((x / SQRT_2).erf() + 1);
    x / 2
}
```

Then, at runtime, a custom low-level kernel will be automatically created for your specific
implementation and will rival a handcrafted GPU implementation. The kernel consists of about 60
lines of WGSL [WebGPU Shading Language](&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/&quot;),
an extremely verbose lower level shader language you probably don&#039;t want to program your deep
learning models in!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Asynchronous execution ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

For [first-party backends](#backends), an asynchronous execution style
is used, which allows to perform various optimizations, such as the previously mentioned automatic
kernel fusion.

Asynchronous execution also ensures that the normal execution of the framework does not block the
model computations, which implies that the framework overhead won&#039;t impact the speed of execution
significantly. Conversely, the intense computations in the model do not interfere with the
responsiveness of the framework. For more information about our asynchronous backends, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Thread-safe building blocks ü¶û
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn emphasizes thread safety by leveraging the
[ownership system of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
With Burn, each module is the owner of its weights. It is therefore possible to send a module to
another thread for computing the gradients, then send the gradients to the main thread that can
aggregate them, and _voil√†_, you get multi-device training.

This is a very different approach from what PyTorch does, where backpropagation actually mutates the
_grad_ attribute of each tensor parameter. This is not a thread-safe operation and therefore
requires lower level synchronization primitives, see
[distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) for reference. Note that
this is still very fast, but not compatible across different backends and quite hard to implement.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Intelligent memory management ü¶Ä
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

One of the main roles of a deep learning framework is to reduce the amount of memory necessary to
run models. The naive way of handling memory is that each tensor has its own memory space, which is
allocated when the tensor is created then deallocated as the tensor gets out of scope. However,
allocating and deallocating data is very costly, so a memory pool is often required to achieve good
throughput. Burn offers an infrastructure that allows for easily creating and selecting memory
management strategies for backends. For more details on memory management in Burn, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

Another very important memory optimization of Burn is that we keep track of when a tensor can be
mutated in-place just by using the ownership system well. Even though it is a rather small memory
optimization on its own, it adds up considerably when training or running inference with larger
models and contributes to reduce the memory usage even more. For more information, see
[this blog post about tensor handling](https://burn.dev/blog/burn-rusty-approach-to-tensor-handling).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel selection üéØ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A good deep learning framework should ensure that models run smoothly on all hardware. However, not
all hardware share the same behavior in terms of execution speed. For instance, a matrix
multiplication kernel can be launched with many different parameters, which are highly sensitive to
the size of the matrices and the hardware. Using the wrong configuration could reduce the speed of
execution by a large factor (10 times or even more in extreme cases), so choosing the right kernels
becomes a priority.

With our home-made backends, we run benchmarks automatically and choose the best configuration for
the current hardware and matrix sizes with a reasonable caching strategy.

This adds a small overhead by increasing the warmup execution time, but stabilizes quickly after a
few forward and backward passes, saving lots of time in the long run. Note that this feature isn&#039;t
mandatory, and can be disabled when cold starts are a priority over optimized throughput.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Hardware specific features üî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is no secret that deep learning is mostly relying on matrix multiplication as its core operation,
since this is how fully-connected neural networks are modeled.

More and more, hardware manufacturers optimize their chips specifically for matrix multiplication
workloads. For instance, Nvidia has its _Tensor Cores_ and today most cellphones have AI specialized
chips. As of this moment, we support Tensor Cores with our LibTorch, Candle, CUDA, Metal and WGPU/SPIR-V
backends, but not other accelerators yet. We hope
[this issue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4195) gets resolved at some point to bring
support to our WGPU backend.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Custom Backend Extension üéí
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn aims to be the most flexible deep learning framework. While it&#039;s crucial to maintain
compatibility with a wide variety of backends, Burn also provides the ability to extend the
functionalities of a backend implementation to suit your personal modeling requirements.

This versatility is advantageous in numerous ways, such as supporting custom operations like flash
attention or manually writing your own kernel for a specific backend to enhance performance. See
[this section](https://burn.dev/burn-book/advanced/backend-extension/index.html) in the Burn Book üî•
for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;


Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust implementations.
We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your models in the cloud,
then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Supported Backends**

| Backend  | Devices                      | Class       |
| -------  | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| CUDA     | NVIDIA GPUs                  | First-Party |
| ROCm     | AMD GPUs                     | First-Party |
| Metal    | Apple GPUs                   | First-Party |
| Vulkan   | Most GPUs on Linux &amp; Windows | First-Party |
| Wgpu     | Most GPUs                    | First-Party |
| NdArray  | Most CPUs                    | Third-Party |
| LibTorch | Most GPUs &amp; CPUs             | Third-Party |
| Candle   | Nvidia, Apple GPUs &amp; CPUs    | Third-Party |

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend üîÑ
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
For now, only the WGPU and CUDA backends have support for fused kernels.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Fusion, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Fusion&lt;Wgpu&gt;&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}

```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server.
The client sends tensor operations over the network to a remote compute backend.
You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand üëá**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard üìà
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption üõ°

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support üê´
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-standard format that exports both the architecture
and the weights of a deep learning model.

Burn supports the importation of models that follow the ONNX standard so you can easily port a model
you have written in another framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn to benefit from all the
advantages our framework offers.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch Models üöö
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Support for loading of PyTorch model weights into Burn‚Äôs native model architecture, ensuring
seamless integration. See
[Burn Book üî• section on importing PyTorch](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/pytorch-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser üåê
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can compile to Web Assembly: Candle and NdArray for CPU, and WGPU for GPU.
This means that you can run inference directly within a browser. We provide several examples of
this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2Ô∏è‚É£ 7Ô∏è‚É£ üò∞
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! üåÑ

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ‚öôÔ∏è
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).


&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**  
&gt; When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency chain.  
&gt; To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file:
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.


## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-walking.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book üî•
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book üî•](https://burn.dev/burn-book/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests üòÑ

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples üôè
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

We have a somewhat large amount of [examples](./examples) in the repository that shows how to use
the framework in diffe

Lapce (IPA: /l√¶ps/) is written in pure Rust with a UI in [Floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor) which makes for lightning-fast computation, and leverages [Wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering. More information about the features of Lapce can be found on the [main website](https://lapce.dev) and user documentation can be found on [GitBook](https://docs.lapce.dev/).

![](https://github.com/lapce/lapce/blob/master/extra/images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Features

* Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
* Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Enjoy the benefits of a &quot;local&quot; experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system. We also have [Lapdev](https://lap.dev/) which can help manage your remote dev environments. 
* Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Rust Programming Language

![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source of &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot; book.

[The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch].

[nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition

You can also read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with
the latest [stable], [beta], or [nightly] Rust releases. Be aware that issues
in those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those
releases are updated less frequently.

[stable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
[beta]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/
[nightly]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/

See the [releases] to download just the code of all the code listings that appear in the book.

[releases]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/releases

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same version that
rust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook
[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook --locked --version &lt;version_num&gt;
```

The book also uses two mdbook plugins which are part of this repository. If you
do not install them, you will see warnings when building and the output will not
look right, but you _will_ still be able to build the book. To use the plugins,
you should run:

```bash
$ cargo install --locked --path packages/mdbook-trpl
```

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in
your web browser.

_Firefox:_

```bash
$ firefox book/index.html                       # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Firefox&quot; book/index.html             # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;firefox.exe&quot; .\book\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start firefox.exe .\book\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
```

_Chrome:_

```bash
$ google-chrome book/index.html                 # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Google Chrome&quot; book/index.html       # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;chrome.exe&quot; .\book\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start chrome.exe .\book\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ cd packages/trpl
$ mdbook test --library-path packages/trpl/target/debug/deps
```

## Contributing

We&#039;d love your help! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] to learn about the
kinds of contributions we&#039;re looking for.

[contrib]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

Because the book is [printed][nostarch], and because we want
to keep the online version of the book close to the print version when
possible, it may take longer than you&#039;re used to for us to address your issue
or pull request.

So far, we&#039;ve been doing a larger revision to coincide with [Rust Editions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/). Between those larger
revisions, we will only be correcting errors. If your issue or pull request
isn&#039;t strictly fixing an error, it might sit until the next time that we&#039;re
working on a large revision: expect on the order of months or years. Thank you
for your patience!

### Translations

We&#039;d love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on
a new language! We&#039;re waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages
before we merge any in, but feel free to start!

[Translations]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATranslations
[mdbook support]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/5

## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
script available in the `ci` directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words,
which is provided in `ci/dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false
positive (say, you used the word `BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid),
you need to add this word to `ci/dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for
consistency).

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

## About

* **[Features](https://bevyengine.org):** A quick overview of Bevy&#039;s features.
* **[News](https://bevyengine.org/news/)**: A development blog that covers our progress, plans and shiny new features.

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

## About the Framework

Leptos is a full-stack, isomorphic Rust web framework leveraging fine-grained reactivity to build declarative user interfaces.

## What does that mean?

- **Full-stack**: Leptos can be used to build apps that run in the browser (client-side rendering), on the server (server-side rendering), or by rendering HTML on the server and then adding interactivity in the browser (server-side rendering with hydration). This includes support for HTTP streaming of both data ([`Resource`s](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/struct.Resource.html)) and HTML (out-of-order or in-order streaming of [`&lt;Suspense/&gt;`](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/fn.Suspense.html) components.)
- **Isomorphic**: Leptos provides primitives to write isomorphic [server functions](https://docs.rs/leptos_server/0.2.5/leptos_server/index.html), i.e., functions that can be called with the ‚Äúsame shape‚Äù on the client or server, but only run on the server. This means you can write your server-only logic (database requests, authentication etc.) alongside the client-side components that will consume it, and call server functions as if they were running in the browser, without needing to create and maintain a separate REST or other API.
- **Web**: Leptos is built on the Web platform and Web standards. The [router](https://docs.rs/leptos_router/latest/leptos_router/) is designed to use Web fundamentals (like links and forms) and build on top of them rather than trying to replace them.
- **Framework**: Leptos provides most of what you need to build a modern web app: a reactive system, templating library, and a router that works on both the server and client side.
- **Fine-grained reactivity**: The entire framework is built from reactive primitives. This allows for extremely performant code with minimal overhead: when a reactive signal‚Äôs value changes, it can update a single text node, toggle a single class, or remove an element from the DOM without any other code running. (So, no virtual DOM overhead!)
- **Declarative**: Tell Leptos how you want the page to look, and let the framework tell the browser how to do it.

Here are some resources for learning more about Leptos:

- [Book](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/) (work in progress)
- [Examples](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/examples)
- [API Documentation](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/)
- [Common Bugs](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/docs/COMMON_BUGS.md) (and how to fix them!)

## `nightly` Note

Most of the examples assume you‚Äôre using `nightly` version of Rust and the `nightly` feature of Leptos. To use `nightly` Rust, you can either set your toolchain globally or on per-project basis.

To set `nightly` as a default toolchain for all projects (and add the ability to compile Rust to WebAssembly, if you haven‚Äôt already):

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

If you&#039;d like to use `nightly` only in your Leptos project however, add [`rust-toolchain.toml`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) file with the following content:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = &quot;nightly&quot;
targets = [&quot;wasm32-unknown-unknown&quot;]
```

The `nightly` feature enables the function call syntax for accessing and setting signals, as opposed to `.get()` and `.set()`. This leads to a consistent mental model in which accessing a reactive value of any kind (a signal, memo, or derived signal) is always represented as a function call. This is only possible with nightly Rust and the `nightly` feature.

## `cargo-leptos`

[`cargo-leptos`](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos) is a build tool that&#039;s designed to make it easy to build apps that run on both the client and the server, with seamless integration. The best way to get started with a real Leptos project right now is to use `cargo-leptos` and our starter templates for [Actix](https://github.com/leptos-rs/start) or [Axum](https://github.com/leptos-rs/start-axum).

```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos
cargo leptos new --git https://github.com/leptos-rs/start
cd [your project name]
cargo leptos watch
```

Open browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## FAQs

### What‚Äôs up with the name?

_Leptos_ (ŒªŒµœÄœÑœåœÇ) is an ancient Greek word meaning ‚Äúthin, light, refined, fine-grained.‚Äù To me, a classicist and not a dog owner, it evokes the lightweight reactive system that powers the framework. I&#039;ve since learned the same word is at the root of the medical term ‚Äúleptospirosis,‚Äù a blood infection that affects humans and animals... My bad. No dogs were harmed in the creation of this framework.

### Is it production ready?

People usually mean one of three things by this question.

1. **Are the APIs stable?** i.e., will I have to rewrite my whole app from Leptos 0.1 to 0.2 to 0.3 to 0.4, or can I write it now and benefit from new features and updates as new versions come?

The APIs are basically settled. We‚Äôre adding new features, but we‚Äôre very happy with where the type system and patterns have landed. I would not expect major breaking changes to your code to adapt to future releases, in terms of architecture.

2. **Are there bugs?**

Yes, I‚Äôm sure there are. You can see from the state of our issue tracker over time that there aren‚Äôt that _many_ bugs and they‚Äôre usually resolved pretty quickly. But for sure, there may be moments where you encounter something that requires a fix at the framework level, which may not be immediately resolved.

3. **Am I a consumer or a contributor?**

This may be the big one: ‚Äúproduction ready‚Äù implies a certain orientation to a library: that you can basically use it, without any special knowledge of its internals or ability to contribute. Everyone has this at some level in their stack: for example I (@gbj) don‚Äôt have the capacity or knowledge to contribute to something like `wasm-bindgen` at this point: I simply rely on it to work.

There are several people in the community using Leptos right now for internal apps at work, who have also become significant contributors. I think this is the right level of production use for now. There may be missing features that you need, and you may end up building them! But for internal apps, if you‚Äôre willing to build and contribute missing pieces along the way, the framework is definitely usable right now.

### Can I use this for native GUI?

Sure! Obviously the `view` macro is for generating DOM nodes but you can use the reactive system to drive any native GUI toolkit that uses the same kind of object-oriented, event-callback-based framework as the DOM pretty easily. The principles are the same:

- Use signals, derived signals, and memos to create your reactive system
- Create GUI widgets
- Use event listeners to update signals
- Create effects to update the UI

The 0.7 update originally set out to create a &quot;generic rendering&quot; approach that would allow us to reuse most of the same view logic to do all of the above. Unfortunately, this has had to be shelved for now due to difficulties encountered by the Rust compiler when building larger-scale applications with the number of generics spread throughout the codebase that this required. It&#039;s an approach I&#039;m looking forward to exploring again in the future; feel free to reach out if you&#039;re interested in this kind of work.

### How is this different from Yew?

Yew is the most-used library for Rust web UI development, but there are several differences between Yew and Leptos, in philosophy, approach, and performance.

- **VDOM vs. fine-grained:** Yew is built on the virtual DOM (VDOM) model: state changes cause components to re-render, generating a new virtual DOM tree. Yew diffs this against the previous VDOM, and applies those patches to the actual DOM. Component functions rerun whenever state changes. Leptos takes an entirely different approach. Components run once, creating (and returning) actual DOM nodes and setting up a reactive system to update those DOM nodes.
- **Performance:** This has huge performance implications: Leptos is simply much faster at both creating and updating the UI than Yew is.
- **Server integration:** Yew was created in an era in which browser-rendered single-page apps (SPAs) were the dominant paradigm. While Leptos supports client-side rendering, it also focuses on integrating with the server side of your application via server functions and multiple modes of serving HTML, including out-of-order streaming.

### How is this different from Dioxus?

Like Leptos, Dioxus is a framework for building UIs using web technologies. However, there are significant differences in approach and features.

- **VDOM vs. fine-grained:** While Dioxus has a performant virtual DOM (VDOM), it still uses coarse-grained/component-scoped reactivity: changing a stateful value reruns the component function and diffs the old UI against the new one. Leptos components use a different mental model, creating (and returning) actual DOM nodes and setting up a reactive system to update those DOM nodes.
- **Web vs. desktop priorities:** Dioxus uses Leptos server functions in its fullstack mode, but does not have the same `&lt;Suspense&gt;`-based support for things like streaming HTML rendering, or share the same focus on holistic web performance. Leptos tends to prioritize holistic web performance (streaming HTML rendering, smaller WASM binary sizes, etc.), whereas Dioxus has an unparalleled experience when building desktop apps, because your application logic runs as a native Rust binary.

### How is this different from Sycamore?

Sycamore and Leptos are both heavily influenced by SolidJS. At this point, Leptos has a larger community and ecosystem and is more actively developed. Other differences:

- **Templating DSLs:** Sycamore uses a custom templating language for its views, while Leptos uses a JSX-like template format.
- **`&#039;static` signals:** One of Leptos‚Äôs main innovations was the creation of `Copy + &#039;static` signals, which have excellent ergonomics. Sycamore is in the process of adopting the same pattern, but this is not yet released.
- **Perseus vs. server functions:** The Perseus metaframework provides an opinionated way to build Sycamore apps that include server functionality. Leptos instead provides primitives like server functions in the core of the framework.

## Sui Overview

Sui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of authorities that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.

Sui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for common use cases. Sui makes the vast majority of transactions processable in parallel, which makes better use of processing resources, and offers the option to increase throughput with more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for common use cases, such as payment transactions and asset transfers. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications, ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.

Sui is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and supports smart contracts written in the [Move programming language](https://github.com/move-language/move) to define assets that may have an owner. Move programs define operations on these assets including custom rules for their creation, the transfer of these assets to new owners, and operations that mutate assets.

Sui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and is also used as [delegated stake on authorities](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos/) within an epoch. The voting power of authorities within this epoch is a function of this delegated stake. Authorities are periodically reconfigured according to the stake delegated to them. In any epoch, the set of authorities is [Byzantine fault tolerant](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to authorities according to their contribution to the operation of the system. Authorities can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that delegated stakes to them.

Sui is supported by several cutting-edge [peer-reviewed studies](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/concepts/research-papers.mdx) and extensive years of open-source development.

## Introduction

**GreptimeDB** is an open-source, cloud-native, unified &amp; cost-effective observability database for **Metrics**, **Logs**, and **Traces**. You can gain real-time insights from Edge to Cloud at Any Scale.

## News

**[GreptimeDB tops JSONBench&#039;s billion-record cold run test!](https://greptime.com/blogs/2025-03-18-jsonbench-greptimedb-performance)**

## Why GreptimeDB

Our core developers have been building observability data platforms for years. Based on our best practices, GreptimeDB was born to give you:

* **Unified Processing of Observability Data**

  A unified database that treats metrics, logs, and traces as timestamped wide events with context, supporting [SQL](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/query-data/sql)/[PromQL](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/query-data/promql) queries and [stream processing](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/flow-computation/overview) to simplify complex data stacks.

* **High Performance and Cost-effective**

   Written in Rust, combines a distributed query engine with [rich indexing](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/manage-data/data-index) (inverted, fulltext, skip data, and vector) and optimized columnar storage to deliver sub-second responses on petabyte-scale data and high-cost efficiency.

* **Cloud-native Distributed Database**

  Built for [Kubernetes](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/deployments/deploy-on-kubernetes/greptimedb-operator-management). GreptimeDB achieves seamless scalability with its [cloud-native architecture](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/concepts/architecture) of separated compute and storage, built on object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) while enabling cross-cloud deployment through a unified data access layer.

* **Developer-Friendly**

  Access standardized SQL/PromQL interfaces through built-in web dashboard, REST API, and MySQL/PostgreSQL protocols. Supports widely adopted data ingestion [protocols](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/protocols/overview) for seamless migration and integration.

* **Flexible Deployment Options**

  Deploy GreptimeDB anywhere from ARM-based edge devices to cloud environments with unified APIs and bandwidth-efficient data synchronization. Query edge and cloud data seamlessly through identical APIs. [Learn how to run on Android](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/deployments/run-on-android/).

| [winget]        | `winget install --id Starship.Starship` |

&lt;/details&gt;

### Step 2. Set up your shell to use Starship

Configure your shell to initialize starship. Select yours from the list below:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Bash&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
eval &quot;$(starship init bash)&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cmd&lt;/summary&gt;

You need to use [Clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html) (v1.2.30+) with Cmd.
Create a file at this path `%LocalAppData%\clink\starship.lua` with the following contents:

```lua
load(io.popen(&#039;starship init cmd&#039;):read(&quot;*a&quot;))()
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Elvish&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:

```sh
eval (starship init elvish)
```

Note: Only Elvish v0.18+ is supported

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Fish&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
starship init fish | source
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Ion&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/ion/initrc`:

```sh
eval $(starship init ion)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Nushell&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of your Nushell configuration (find it by running `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):

```sh
mkdir ($nu.data-dir | path join &quot;vendor/autoload&quot;)
starship init nu | save -f ($nu.data-dir | path join &quot;vendor/autoload/starship.nu&quot;)
```

Note: Only Nushell v0.96+ is supported

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;PowerShell&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of your PowerShell configuration (find it by running `$PROFILE`):

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&amp;starship init powershell)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Tcsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.tcshrc`:

```sh
eval `starship init tcsh`
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Xonsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.xonshrc`:

```python
execx($(starship init xonsh))
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Zsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
eval &quot;$(starship init zsh)&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Step 3. Configure Starship

Start a new shell instance, and you should see your beautiful new shell prompt.

## What does this do?

This is a cross-platform software keyboard remapper for Linux, macOS and Windows.
A short summary of the features:

- multiple layers of key functionality
- advanced key behaviour customization (e.g. tap-hold, macros, unicode)

To see all of the features, see the [configuration guide](./docs/config.adoc).

You can find pre-built binaries in the [releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
or read on for build instructions.

You can see a [list of known issues here](./docs/platform-known-issues.adoc).

### Demo

#### Demo video
[Showcase of multi-layer functionality (30s, 1.7 MB)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6634136/183001314-f64a7e26-4129-4f20-bf26-7165a6e02c38.mp4).

#### Online simulator

You can check out the [online simulator](https://jtroo.github.io)
to test configuration validity and test input simulation.

## Why is this useful?

Imagine if, instead of pressing Shift to type uppercase letters, we had giant
keyboards with separate keys for lowercase and uppercase letters. I hope we can
all agree: that would be a terrible user experience!

A way to think of how Shift keys work is that they switch your input to another
layer of functionality where you now type uppercase letters and symbols
instead of lowercase letters and numbers.

What kanata allows you to do is take this alternate layer concept that Shift
keys have and apply it to any key. You can then customize what those layers do
to suit your exact needs and workflows.

## Usage

Running kanata currently does not start it in a background process.
You will need to keep the window that starts kanata running to keep kanata active.
Some tips for running kanata in the background:

- Windows: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/193
- Linux: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/130#discussioncomment-10227272
- Run from tray icon: [kanata-tray](https://github.com/rszyma/kanata-tray)

### Pre-built executables

See the
[releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
for executables and instructions.

### Build it yourself

This project uses the latest Rust stable toolchain. If you installed the
Rust toolchain using `rustup`, e.g. by using the instructions from the
[official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started),
you can get the latest stable toolchain with `rustup update stable`.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

Using `cargo install`:

    cargo install kanata

    # On Linux and macOS, this may not work without `sudo`, see below
    kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Linux:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is used because kanata opens /dev/ files
    #
    # See below if you want to avoid needing sudo:
    # https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/wiki/Avoid-using-sudo-on-Linux
    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Windows.

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive
    target\debug\kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in macOS:

First install the Karabiner driver by following the macOS documentation
in the [releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/).

Then you can compile and run with the instructions below:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is needed to gain permission to intercept the keyboard

    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

The full configuration guide is [found here](./docs/config.adoc).

Sample configuration files are found in [cfg_samples](./cfg_samples). The
[simple.kbd](./cfg_samples/simple.kbd) file contains a basic configuration file
that is hopefully easy to understand but does not contain all features. The
`kanata.kbd` contains an example of all features with documentation. The
release assets also have a `kanata.kbd` file that is tested to work with that
release. All key names can be found in the [keys module](./src/keys/mod.rs),
and you can also define your own key names.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Feature flags

When either building yourself or using `cargo install`,
you can add feature flags that
enable functionality that is turned off by default.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

If you want to enable the `cmd` actions,
add the flag `--features cmd`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd
cargo install --features cmd
```

On Windows,
if you want to compile a binary that uses the Interception driver,
you should add the flag `--features interception_driver`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features interception_driver
cargo install --features interception_driver
```

To combine multiple flags,
use a single `--features` flag
and use a comma to separate the features.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd,interception_driver
cargo install --features cmd,interception_driver
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## What does the name mean?

I wanted a &quot;k&quot; word since this relates to keyboards. According to Wikipedia,
kanata is an indigenous Iroquoian word meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot; and is
the origin of Canada&#039;s name.

There&#039;s also PPT‚úß.

## Motivation

TLDR: QMK features but for any keyboard, not just fancy mechanical ones.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Long version&lt;/summary&gt;

I have a few keyboards that run [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/). QMK allows the
user to customize the functionality of their keyboard to their heart&#039;s content.

One great use case of QMK is its ability map keys so that they overlap with the
home row keys but are accessible on another layer. I won&#039;t comment on
productivity, but I find this greatly helps with my keyboard comfort.

For example, these keys are on the right side of the keyboard:

    7 8 9
    u i o
    j k l
    m , .

On one layer I have arrow keys in the same position, and on another layer I
have a numpad.

    arrows:       numpad:
    - - -         7 8 9
    - ‚Üë -         4 5 6
    ‚Üê ‚Üì ‚Üí         1 2 3
    - - -         0 * .

One could add as many customizations as one likes to improve comfort, speed,
etc. Personally my main motivator is comfort due to a repetitive strain injury
in the past.

However, QMK doesn&#039;t run everywhere. In fact, it doesn&#039;t run on **most**
hardware you can get. You can&#039;t get it to run on a laptop keyboard or any
mainstream office keyboard. I believe that the comfort and empowerment QMK
provides should be available to anyone with a computer on their existing
hardware, instead of having to purchase an enthusiast mechanical keyboard
(which are admittedly very nice ‚Äî I own a few ‚Äî but can be costly).

The best alternative solution that I found for keyboards that don&#039;t run QMK was
[kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad). This is an excellent project
and I recommend it if you want to try something similar.

The reason for this project&#039;s existence is that kmonad is written in Haskell
and I have no idea how to begin contributing to a Haskell project. From an
outsider&#039;s perspective I think Haskell is a great language but I really can&#039;t
wrap my head around it. And there are a few [outstanding issues](./docs/kmonad_comparison.md)
at the time of writing that make kmonad suboptimal for my personal workflows.

This project is written in Rust because Rust is my favourite programming
language and the prior work of the awesome [keyberon crate](https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon)
exists.
&lt;/details&gt;

- [keymapper](https://github.com/houmain/keymapper): Context-aware cross-platform key remapper with a different transformation model (Linux, Windows, Mac)
- [mouseless](https://github.com/jbensmann/mouseless): Linux-only mouse-focused key remapper that also has layers, key combo and tap-hold capabilities

### Why the list?

While kanata is the best tool for some, it may not be the best tool for
you. I&#039;m happy to introduce you to tools that may better suit your needs. This
list is also useful as reference/inspiration for functionality that could be
added to kanata.

## Donations/Support?

The author (jtroo) will not accept monetary donations for work on kanata.
Please instead donate your time and/or money to charity.

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ÀàdiÀêno ä/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found in the manual
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/references/contributing/building_from_source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## üöÄ Start Contributing

### Prerequisites

- MacOS
  - Xcode 13 or later
  - Brew

### 1. Clone repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-for-command-line.git
```

### 2. Setup
Hassle-free setup:
```shell
npm run setup
```

Or if you&#039;d like to DIY:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Manual Setup&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

### 1. Install platform dependencies

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config jq dpkg curl wget cmake clang libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libdbus-1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev valac libibus-1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev sqlite3 libxdo-dev protobuf-compiler
```
### 2. Install Rust toolchain using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs):

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

For pre-commit hooks, the following commands are required:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install typos-cli
```

For MacOS development make sure the right targets are installed:

```shell
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Setup Python and Node using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Add mise integrations to your shell:

For zsh:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; &quot;${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc&quot;
```

For bash:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
```

For fish:
```shell
echo &#039;mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Install the Python and Node toolchains using:

```shell
mise trust
mise install
```

### 4. Setup precommit hooks

Run `pnpm` in root directory to add pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;


### 3. Start Local Development
To compile and view changes made to `q chat`:
```shell
cargo run --bin q_cli -- chat
```

&gt; If you are working on other q commands, just replace `chat` with the command name 

To run tests for the Q CLI crate:
```shell
cargo test -p q_cli
```

To format Rust files:
```shell
cargo +nightly fmt
```

To run clippy:
```shell
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --color always -- -D warnings
```



### üí° Quick Tip for Onboarding

Use Q CLI to help you onboard Q CLI! 

Start a `q chat` session:

```shell
q chat
```

Once inside `q chat`, you can supply project context by adding the [`codebase-summary.md`](codebase-summary.md) file:

```shell
/context add codebase-summary.md
```

This enables Q to answer onboarding questions like:

- ‚ÄúWhat does this crate do?‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWhere is X implemented?‚Äù

- ‚ÄúHow do these components interact?‚Äù

Great for speeding up your ramp-up and navigating the repo more effectively.




## üèóÔ∏è Project Layout

  intercepts the user‚Äôs terminal edit buffer.
- [`q_cli`](crates/q_cli/) - the `q` CLI, allows users to interface with Amazon Q Developer from
  the command line
- [`fig_desktop`](crates/fig_desktop/) - the Rust desktop app, uses
  [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao/latest/tao/)/[`wry`](https://docs.rs/wry/latest/wry/)
  for windowing/webviews
- [`fig_input_method`](crates/fig_input_method/) - The input method used to get cursor
  position on macOS
- [`vscode`](extensions/vscode/) - Contains the VSCode plugin needed
  for the Amazon Q Developer for command line to work in VSCode
- [`jetbrains`](extensions/jetbrains/) - Contains the VSCode plugin
  needed for the Amazon Q Developer for command line to work in Jetbrains IDEs

Other folder to be aware of

- [`build-scripts/`](build-scripts/) - Contains all python scripts to build,
  sign, and test the project on macOS and Linux
- [`crates/`](crates/) - Contains all internal rust crates
- [`packages/`](packages/) - Contains all internal npm packages
- [`proto/`](proto/) -
  [protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) message
  specification for inter-process communication
- [`tests/`](tests/) - Contain integration tests for the projects

Below is a high level architecture of how the different components of the app and
their IPC:

  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Fluvio** is a lean and mean distributed data streaming engine written in Rust. Combined with **Stateful DataFlow** distributed stream processing framework, Fluvio provides a *unified* *composable* *distributed streaming* and *stream processin*g paradigm for developers. It is the foundation of [InfinyOn Cloud](https://infinyon.cloud/).

## Quick Start - Get started with Fluvio and Stateful DataFlow in 5 minutes or less on your system!

### Step 1. Download Fluvio Version Manager:

Fluvio is installed via the **Fluvio Version Manager**, shortened to `fvm`.

To install `fvm`, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```
As part of the initial setup, `fvm` will also install the Fluvio CLI available in the stable channel as of the moment of installation.

Fluvio is stored in `$HOME/.fluvio`, with the executable binaries stored in `$HOME/.fluvio/bin`.

&gt; For the best compatibliity on Windows, InfinyOn recommends WSL2

### Step 2. Start a cluster:

Start cluster on you local machine with the following command:

```bash
fluvio cluster start
```

### Step 3. Install SDF CLI

Stateful dataflows are managed via `sdf cli` that we install it using `fvm`.

```bash
fvm install sdf-beta9
```

### Step 4. Create the Dataflow file

Create a dataflow file in the directory `split-sentence` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p split-sentence-inline
cd split-sentence-inline
```

Create the `dataflow.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: 0.5.0

meta:
  name: split-sentence-inline
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: example

config:
  converter: raw

topics:
  sentence:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw
  words:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw

services:
  sentence-words:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: sentence

    transforms:
      - operator: flat-map
        run: |
          fn sentence_to_words(sentence: String) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
            Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
          }
      - operator: map
        run: |
          pub fn augment_count(word: String) -&gt; Result&lt;String&gt; {
            Ok(format!(&quot;{}({})&quot;, word, word.chars().count()))
          }

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: words
```

### Step 5. Run the DataFlow

Use sdf command line tool to run the dataflow:

```bash
sdf run --ui
```
&gt; The --ui flag serves the graphical representation of the dataflow on SDF Studio.

### Step 6. Test the DataFlow

Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:
```bash
fluvio produce sentence
```
Input some text, for example:
```bash
Hello world
Hi there
```
Consume from `words` to retrieve the result:
```bash
fluvio consume words -Bd
```
See the results, for example:
```bash
Hello(1)
world(1)
Hi(1)
there(1)
```

### Step 6. Inspect State

The dataflow collects runtime metrics that you can inspect in the runtime terminal.

Check the sentence-to-words counters:
```bash
show state sentence-words/sentence-to-words/metrics
```
See results, for example:
```bash
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       2          0
 ```
 Check the augment-count counters:
 ```bash
 show state sentence-words/augment-count/metrics
 ```
 See results, for example:
 ```bash
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       4          0
 ```
Congratulations! You&#039;ve successfully built and run a composable dataflow!

#### Learn how to build custom connectors
Fluvio can connect to practically any system that you can think of.
- For first party systems, fluvio clients can integrate with the edge system or application to source data.
- For third party systems fluvio connectors connect at the protocol level and collects data into fluvio topics.

Out of the box Fluvio has native http, webhook, mqtt, kafka inbound connectors. In terms of outbound connectors out of the box Fluvio supports http, SQL, kafka, and experimental builds of DuckDB, Redis, S3, Graphite etc.

Using Connector Development Kit, its intuitive to build connectors to any system fast.

&lt;br&gt;

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like `Cannot read property &#039;importKey&#039;`. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.
&gt;
&gt;This can be configured in [Vaultwarden directly](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS) or using a third-party reverse proxy ([some examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).
&gt;
&gt;If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with [Let&#039;s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Some proxies automatically do this step, like Caddy or Traefik (see examples linked above).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

The main way to use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 80:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 80:80
```

&lt;br&gt;

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Alloy

Alloy connects applications to blockchains.

Alloy is a rewrite of [`ethers-rs`] from the ground up, with exciting new
features, high performance, and excellent [docs](https://docs.rs/alloy).

We also have a [book](https://alloy.rs/) on all things Alloy and many [examples](https://github.com/alloy-rs/examples) to help you get started.

## Installation

Alloy consists of a number of crates that provide a range of functionality essential for interfacing with any Ethereum-based blockchain.

The easiest way to get started is to add the `alloy` crate with the `full` feature flag from the command-line using Cargo:

```sh
cargo add alloy --features full
```

Alternatively, you can add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
alloy = { version = &quot;0.12&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```

For a more fine-grained control over the features you wish to include, you can add the individual crates to your `Cargo.toml` file, or use the `alloy` crate with the features you need.

A comprehensive list of available features can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/alloy/latest/features) or in the [`alloy` crate&#039;s `Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/blob/main/crates/alloy/Cargo.toml).

## Overview

This repository contains the following crates:

- [`alloy`]: Meta-crate for the entire project, including [`alloy-core`]
- [`alloy-consensus`] - Ethereum consensus interface
  - [`alloy-consensus-any`] - Catch-all consensus interface for multiple networks
- [`alloy-contract`] - Interact with on-chain contracts

## Supported Rust Versions (MSRV)

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
--&gt;

The current MSRV (minimum supported rust version) is 1.82.

Alloy will keep a rolling MSRV policy of **at least** two versions behind the
latest stable release (so if the latest stable release is 1.58, we would
support 1.56).

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a patch
(pre-1.0) or minor (post-1.0) release.

## Contributing

Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have you! We have
[a contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you get involved in the
Alloy project.

Pull requests will not be merged unless CI passes, so please ensure that your
contribution follows the linting rules and passes clippy.

## Note on `no_std`

Because these crates are primarily network-focused, we do not intend to support
`no_std` for most of them at this time.

The following crates support `no_std`:

- alloy-eips
- alloy-genesis
- alloy-serde
- alloy-consensus

If you would like to add `no_std` support to a crate, please make sure to update
`scripts/check_no_std.sh` as well.

## Credits

- [`ethers.js`](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/)
- [`rust-web3`](https://github.com/tomusdrw/rust-web3/)
- [`ruint`](https://github.com/recmo/uint)
