uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.


&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.82.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and Gnu Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

- And more! [Take a tour of Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/).

## Instant hot-reloading

With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup and styles and see the results in real time.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioxusLabs/screenshots/refs/heads/main/blitz/hotreload-video.webp&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;video src=&quot;https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/10237910/386919031-6da371d5-3340-46da-84ff-628216851ba6.mov&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; --&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;video src=&quot;https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/10237910/386919031-6da371d5-3340-46da-84ff-628216851ba6.mov&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## First-class Android and iOS support

Dioxus is the fastest way to build native mobile apps with Rust. Simply run `dx serve --platform android` and your app is running in an emulator or on device in seconds. Call directly into JNI and Native APIs.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/android_and_ios2.avif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Bundle for web, desktop, and mobile

Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guides/assets), and more. Build WebApps weighing [less than 50kb](https://github.com/ealmloff/tiny-dioxus/) and desktop/mobile apps less than 5mb.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/bundle.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Fantastic documentation

We&#039;ve put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our Docs runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/) for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new Dioxus features - [check it out!](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

&gt; The examples in the main branch of this repository target the git version of dioxus and the CLI. If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the [0.6 branch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples).

The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;
```

However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli. If you are running the git version of dioxus, you can install the matching version of the CLI with:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked
```

With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You just need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:

```sh
dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features
```

## Dioxus vs other frameworks

We love all frameworks and enjoy watching innovation in the Rust ecosystem. In fact, many of our projects are shared with other frameworks. For example, our flex-box library [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) is used by [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), [Zed](https://zed.dev/), [Lapce](https://lapce.dev/), [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced), and many more.

Dioxus places an emphasis on a few key points that make it different from other frameworks:

- **React-like**: we rely on concepts like components, props, and hooks to build UIs, with our state management being closer to Svelte than to SolidJS.
- **HTML and CSS**: we lean completely into HTML and CSS, quirks and all.
- **Renderer-agnostic**: you can swap out the renderer for any platform you want thanks to [our fast VirtualDOM](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/templates-diffing).
- **Collaborative**: whenever possible, we spin out crates like [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy), [manganis](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/manganis), [include_mdbook](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/include_mdbook), and [blitz](http://github.com/dioxusLabs/blitz) so the ecosystem can grow together.

### Dioxus vs Tauri

Tauri is a framework for building desktop mobile apps where your frontend is written in a web-based framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Whenever you need to do native work, you can write Rust functions and call them from your frontend.

- **Natively Rust**: Tauri&#039;s architecture limits your UI to either JavaScript or WebAssembly. With Dioxus, your Rust code is running natively on the user&#039;s machine, letting you do things like spawning threads, accessing the filesystem, without any IPC bridge. This drastically simplifies your app&#039;s architecture and makes it easier to build. You can build a Tauri app with Dioxus-Web as a frontend if you&#039;d like.

- **Different scopes**: Tauri needs to support JavaScript and its complex build tooling, limiting the scope of what you can do with it. Since Dioxus is exclusively focused on Rust, we&#039;re able to provide extra utilities like Server Functions, advanced bundling, and a native renderer.

- **Shared DNA**: While Tauri and Dioxus are separate projects, they do share libraries like Tao and Wry: windowing and webview libraries maintained by the Tauri team.

### Dioxus vs Leptos

Leptos is a library for building fullstack web-apps, similar to SolidJS and SolidStart. The two libraries share similar goals on the web, but have several key differences:

- **Reactivity model**: Leptos uses signals to drive both reactivity and rendering, while Dioxus uses signals just for reactivity. For managing re-renders, Dioxus uses a highly optimized VirtualDOM to support desktop and mobile architectures. Both Dioxus and Leptos are extremely fast.

- **Different scopes**: Dioxus provides renderers for web, desktop, mobile, LiveView, and more. We also maintain community libraries and a cross-platform SDK. Leptos has a tighter focus on the fullstack web with features that Dioxus doesn&#039;t have like islands, `&lt;Form /&gt;` components, and other web-specific utilities.

- **Different DSLs**: Dioxus uses its own custom Rust-like DSL for building UIs while Leptos uses an HTML-like syntax. We chose this to retain compatibility with IDE features like code-folding and syntax highlighting. Generally, Dioxus leans into more &quot;magic&quot; with its DSL including automatic formatting of strings and hot-reloading of simple Rust expressions.

```rust
// dioxus
rsx! {
  div {
    class: &quot;my-class&quot;,
    enabled: true,
    &quot;Hello, {name}&quot;
  }
}

// leptos
view! {
  &lt;div class=&quot;my-class&quot; enabled={true}&gt;
    &quot;Hello &quot;
    {name}
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
```

### Dioxus vs Yew

Yew is a framework for building single-page web apps and initially served as an inspiration for Dioxus. Unfortunately, the architecture of Yew didn&#039;t support the various features we wanted, and thus Dioxus was born.

- **Single-page apps**: Yew is designed exclusively for single-page web apps and is intrinsically tied to the web platform. Dioxus is fullstack and cross-platform, making it suitable for building web, desktop, mobile, and server apps.

- **Developer Tooling**: Dioxus provides a number of utilities like autoformatting, hot-reloading, and a bundler.

- **Ongoing support**: Dioxus is very actively maintained with new features and bug fixes being added on a daily basis.

### Dioxus vs egui

egui is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust powering tools like [Rerun.io](https://www.rerun.io).

- **Immediate vs Retained**: egui is designed to be re-rendered on every frame. This is suitable for games and other interactive applications, but it does not retain style and layout state between frames. Dioxus is a retained UI framework, meaning that the UI is built once and then modified between frames. This enables Dioxus to use native web technologies like HTML and CSS with better battery life and performance.

- **Customizable**: egui brings its own styling and layout solution while Dioxus expects you to use the built-in HTML and CSS. This enables dioxus apps to use any CSS library like Tailwind or Material UI.

- **State management**: egui&#039;s state management is based on a single global state object. Dioxus encourages encapsulation of state by using components and props, making components more reusable.

### Dioxus vs Iced

Iced is a cross-platform GUI library inspired by Elm. Iced renders natively with WGPU and supports the web using DOM nodes.

- **Elm state management**: Iced uses Elm&#039;s state management model, which is based on message passing and reducers. This is simply a different state management model than Dioxus and can be rather verbose at times.

- **Native Feel**: Since Dioxus uses a webview as its renderer, it automatically gets native text input, paste handling, and other native features like accessibility. Iced&#039;s renderer currently doesn&#039;t implement these features, making it feel less native.

- **WGPU**: Dioxus&#039; WGPU renderer is currently quite immature and not yet ready for production use. Iced&#039;s WGPU renderer is much more mature and is being used in production. This enables certain types of apps that need GPU access to be built with Iced that can&#039;t currently be built with Dioxus.

### Dioxus vs Electron

Dioxus and Electron are two entirely different projects with similar goals. Electron makes it possible for developers to build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Lightweight**: Dioxus uses the system&#039;s native WebView - or optionally, a WGPU renderer - to render the UI. This makes a typical Dioxus app about 15mb on macOS in comparison to Electron&#039;s 100mb. Electron also ships an embedded chromium instance which cannot share system resources with the host OS in the same way as Dioxus.

- **Maturity**: Electron is a mature project with a large community and a lot of tooling. Dioxus is still quite young in comparison to Electron. Expect to run into features like deep-linking that require extra work to implement.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **If you want to experience a more powerful AI wrapper application, you can try the Noi (https://github.com/lencx/Noi), which is a successor to the ChatGPT desktop application concept.**

---

This is an unofficial project solely intended for personal learning and research. Since the ChatGPT desktop application was open-sourced, it has garnered a lot of attention, and I want to thank everyone for their support. However, as the project progressed, two issues have arisen that greatly impact its future development:

- Some individuals have repackaged and sold it for profit.
- The name and icon of ChatGPT could potentially lead to infringement disputes.

## Live Demo

- [ChatGPT Desktop Application v1.0.0](https://youtu.be/IIuuB5vFFAQ)
- [ChatGPT automatically performs the &quot;Continue generating&quot; button, freeing up your hands.](https://youtu.be/bbL5cPmiGig)

# Rustlings 🦀❤️

&lt;/div&gt;

Greetings and welcome to Rustlings.
This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

It is recommended to do the Rustlings exercises in parallel to reading [the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust 📚️

[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) is another recommended resource that you might find helpful.
It contains code examples and exercises similar to Rustlings, but online.

## Getting Started

### Installing Rust

Before installing Rustlings, you need to have the **latest version of Rust** installed.
Visit [www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for further instructions on installing Rust.
This will also install _Cargo_, Rust&#039;s package/project manager.

&gt; 🐧 If you are on Linux, make sure you have installed `gcc` (for a linker).
&gt;
&gt; Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`
&gt;
&gt; Dnf: `sudo dnf install gcc`

&gt; 🍎 If you are on MacOS, make sure you have installed Xcode and its developer tools by running `xcode-select --install`.

### Installing Rustlings

The following command will download and compile Rustlings:

```bash
cargo install rustlings
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the installation fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

- Make sure you have the latest Rust version by running `rustup update`
- Try adding the `--locked` flag: `cargo install rustlings --locked`
- Otherwise, please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new)

&lt;/details&gt;

### Initialization

After installing Rustlings, run the following command to initialize the `rustlings/` directory:

```bash
rustlings init
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the command &lt;code&gt;rustlings&lt;/code&gt; can&#039;t be found…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

You are probably using Linux and installed Rust using your package manager.

Cargo installs binaries to the directory `~/.cargo/bin`.
Sadly, package managers often don&#039;t add `~/.cargo/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.

The solution is to …

- either add `~/.cargo/bin` manually to `PATH`
- or to uninstall Rust from the package manager and install it using the official way with `rustup`: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

&lt;/details&gt;

Now, go into the newly initialized directory and launch Rustlings for further instructions on getting started with the exercises:

```bash
cd rustlings/
rustlings
```

## Working environment

### Editor

Our general recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [rust-analyzer plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
But any editor that supports [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) should be enough for working on the exercises.

### Terminal

While working with Rustlings, please use a modern terminal for the best user experience.
The default terminal on Linux and Mac should be sufficient.
On Windows, we recommend the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal).

## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `exercises/&lt;topic&gt;`.
For every topic, there is an additional `README.md` file with some resources to get you started on the topic.
We highly recommend that you have a look at them before you start 📚️

Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and it&#039;s up to you to fix it!
Some exercises contain tests that need to pass for the exercise to be done ✅

Search for `TODO` and `todo!()` to find out what you need to change.
Ask for hints by entering `h` in the _watch mode_ 💡

### Watch Mode

After the [initialization](#initialization), Rustlings can be launched by simply running the command `rustlings`.

This will start the _watch mode_ which walks you through the exercises in a predefined order (what we think is best for newcomers).
It will rerun the current exercise automatically every time you change the exercise&#039;s file in the `exercises/` directory.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If detecting file changes in the &lt;code&gt;exercises/&lt;/code&gt; directory fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

&gt; You can add the **`--manual-run`** flag (`rustlings --manual-run`) to manually rerun the current exercise by entering `r` in the watch mode.
&gt;
&gt; Please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new) with some information about your operating system and whether you run Rustlings in a container or virtual machine (e.g. WSL).

&lt;/details&gt;

### Exercise List

In the [watch mode](#watch-mode) (after launching `rustlings`), you can enter `l` to open the interactive exercise list.

The list allows you to…

- See the status of all exercises (done or pending)
- `c`: Continue at another exercise (temporarily skip some exercises or go back to a previous one)
- `r`: Reset status and file of the selected exercise (you need to _reload/reopen_ its file in your editor afterwards)

See the footer of the list for all possible keys.

## Questions?

If you need any help while doing the exercises and the builtin-hints aren&#039;t helpful, feel free to ask in the [_Q&amp;A_ category of the discussions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=) if your question wasn&#039;t asked yet 💡

## Third-Party Exercises

Third-party exercises are a set of exercises maintained by the community.
You can use the same `rustlings` program that you installed with `cargo install rustlings` to run them:

- 🇯🇵 [Japanese Rustlings](https://github.com/sotanengel/rustlings-jp)：A Japanese translation of the Rustlings exercises.
- 🇨🇳 [Simplified Chinese Rustlings](https://github.com/SandmeyerX/rustlings-zh-cn): A simplified Chinese translation of the Rustlings exercises.

Do you want to create your own set of Rustlings exercises to focus on some specific topic?
Or do you want to translate the original Rustlings exercises?
Then follow the the guide about [third-party exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_EXERCISES.md)!

## Continuing On

Once you&#039;ve completed Rustlings, put your new knowledge to good use!
Continue practicing your Rust skills by building your own projects, contributing to Rustlings, or finding other open-source projects to contribute to.

## Uninstalling Rustlings

If you want to remove Rustlings from your system, run the following command:

```bash
cargo uninstall rustlings
```

```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Platform support

See uv&#039;s [platform support](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/platforms/) document.

## Versioning policy

See uv&#039;s [versioning policy](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/versioning/) document.

## Contributing

We are passionate about supporting contributors of all levels of experience and would love to see
you get involved in the project. See the
[contributing guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

---

**eza** is a modern alternative for the venerable file-listing command-line program `ls` that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it’s **small**, **fast**, and just **one single binary**.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, eza attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of `ls`.

---

**eza** features not in exa (non-exhaustive):

- Fixes [“The Grid Bug”](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/issues/66#issuecomment-1656758327) introduced in exa 2021.
- Hyperlink support.
- Mount point details.
- Selinux context output.
- Git repo status output.
- Human readable relative dates.
- Several security fixes.
- Support for `bright` terminal colours.
- Many smaller bug fixes/changes!
- Configuration `theme.yml` file for customization of colors and icons.

...and like, so much more that it became exhausting to update this all the time.
Like seriously, we have a lot of good stuff.

---

&lt;a id=&quot;try-it&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Try it!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

### Nix ❄️

If you already have Nix setup with flake support, you can try out eza with the `nix run` command:

    nix run github:eza-community/eza

Nix will build eza and run it.

If you want to pass arguments this way, use e.g. `nix run github:eza-community/eza -- -ol`.

# Installation

eza is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Platform and distribution
specific installation instructions can be found in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/eza.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/eza/versions)

---

&lt;a id=&quot;options&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Command-line options&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

eza’s options are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike `ls`’s. Quick overview:

## Display options

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

- **-1**, **--oneline**: display one entry per line

- **--hyperlink**: display entries as hyperlinks
- **--absolute=(mode)**: display entries with their absolute path (on, follow, off)

&lt;/details&gt;

## Filtering options

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

- **-a**, **--all**: show hidden and &#039;dot&#039; files
- **-d**, **--list-dirs**: list directories like regular files

- **-I**, **--ignore-glob=(globs)**: glob patterns (pipe-separated) of files to ignore

Pass the `--all` option twice to also show the `.` and `..` directories.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Long view options

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

These options are available when running with `--long` (`-l`):

- **-b**, **--binary**: list file sizes with binary prefixes
- **-B**, **--bytes**: list file sizes in bytes, without any prefixes
- **-g**, **--group**: list each file’s group
- **-h**, **--header**: add a header row to each column

- **--git-repos-no-status**: list whether a directory is a Git repository, but not its status (faster)
- **--no-git**: suppress Git status (always overrides `--git`, `--git-repos`, `--git-repos-no-status`)
- **--time-style**: how to format timestamps. valid timestamp styles are ‘`default`’, ‘`iso`’, ‘`long-iso`’, ‘`full-iso`’, ‘`relative`’, or a custom style ‘`+&lt;FORMAT&gt;`’ (E.g., ‘`+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`’ =&gt; ‘`2023-09-30 13:00`’. For more specifications on the format string, see the _`eza(1)` manual page_ and [chrono documentation](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html).).
- **--total-size**: show recursive directory size
- **--no-permissions**: suppress the permissions field
- **-o**, **--octal-permissions**: list each file&#039;s permission in octal format
- **--no-filesize**: suppress the filesize field

- **--no-time**: suppress the time field
- **--stdin**: read file names from stdin

Some of the options accept parameters:

- Valid **--colo\[u\]r** options are **always**, **automatic** (or **auto** for short), and **never**.
- Valid sort fields are **accessed**, **changed**, **created**, **extension**, **Extension**, **inode**, **modified**, **name**, **Name**, **size**, **type**, and **none**. Fields starting with a capital letter sort uppercase before lowercase. The modified field has the aliases **date**, **time**, and **newest**, while its reverse has the aliases **age** and **oldest**.
- Valid time fields are **modified**, **changed**, **accessed**, and **created**.
- Valid time styles are **default**, **iso**, **long-iso**, **full-iso**, and **relative**.



See the `man` pages for further documentation of usage. They are available
- online [in the repo](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/man)
- in your terminal via `man eza`, as of version [`[0.18.13] - 2024-04-25`](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01813---2024-04-25)
&lt;/details&gt;


## Custom Themes
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

**Eza** has recently added support for a `theme.yml` file, where you can specify all of the existing theme-ing options
available for the `LS_COLORS` and `EXA_COLORS` environment variables, as well as the option to specify different icons
for different file types and extensions. Any existing environment variables set will continue to work and will take
precedence for backwards compatibility.

#### **New** Pre-made themes
Check out the themes available in the official [eza-themes](https://github.com/eza-community/eza-themes) repository, or contribute your own.

An example theme file is available in `docs/theme.yml`, and needs to either be placed in a directory specified by the 
environment variable `EZA_CONFIG_DIR`, or will looked for by default in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/eza`.

Full details are available on the [man page](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/man/eza_colors-explanation.5.md) and an example theme file is included [here](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/docs/theme.yml)

&lt;/details&gt;

## About

**Yew** is a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly.

* Features a macro for declaring interactive HTML with Rust expressions. Developers who have experience using JSX in React should feel quite at home when using Yew.
* Achieves high performance by minimizing DOM API calls for each page render and by making it easy to offload processing to background web workers.
* Supports JavaScript interoperability, allowing developers to leverage NPM packages and integrate with existing JavaScript applications.

*Note: Yew is not 1.0 yet. Be prepared to do major refactoring due to breaking API changes.*

The maintainers have a meeting every friday at UTC 15. The meeting notes can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/@winit-meetings).

## Usage

Winit is a window creation and management library. It can create windows and lets you handle
events (for example: the window being resized, a key being pressed, a mouse movement, etc.)
produced by the window.

Winit is designed to be a low-level brick in a hierarchy of libraries. Consequently, in order to
show something on the window you need to use the platform-specific getters provided by winit, or
another library.

## MSRV Policy

This crate&#039;s Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is **1.73**. Changes to
the MSRV will be accompanied by a minor version bump.

As a **tentative** policy, the upper bound of the MSRV is given by the following
formula:

```
min(sid, stable - 3)
```

Where `sid` is the current version of `rustc` provided by [Debian Sid], and
`stable` is the latest stable version of Rust. This bound may be broken in case of a major ecosystem shift or a security vulnerability.

[Debian Sid]: https://packages.debian.org/sid/rustc

An exception is made for the Android platform, where a higher Rust version
must be used for certain Android features. In this case, the MSRV will be
capped at the latest stable version of Rust minus three. This inconsistency is
not reflected in Cargo metadata, as it is not powerful enough to expose this
restriction.

Redox OS is also not covered by this MSRV policy, as it requires a Rust nightly
toolchain to compile.

All crates in the [`rust-windowing`] organizations have the
same MSRV policy.

[`rust-windowing`]: https://github.com/rust-windowing

## Status

This project has reached a minimum-viable-product level of quality. Many people use it as their daily driver, but it may be unstable for some commands. Nu&#039;s design is subject to change as it matures.

## Learning About Nu

The [Nushell book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/) is the primary source of Nushell documentation. You can find [a full list of Nu commands in the book](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/), and we have many examples of using Nu in our [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/).

We&#039;re also active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn); come and chat with us!

## Installation

To quickly install Nu:

```bash
# Linux and macOS
brew install nushell
# Windows
winget install nushell
```

To use `Nu` in GitHub Action, check [setup-nu](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nu) for more detail.

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [installation chapter of the book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html). Nu is available via many package managers:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nushell.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions)

For details about which platforms the Nushell team actively supports, see [our platform support policy](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

## Configuration

The default configurations can be found at [sample_config](crates/nu-utils/src/default_files)
which are the configuration files one gets when they startup Nushell for the first time.

It sets all of the default configuration to run Nushell.  From here one can
then customize this file for their specific needs.

To see where *config.nu* is located on your system simply type this command.

```rust
$nu.config-path
```

Please see our [book](https://www.nushell.sh) for all of the Nushell documentation.


## Philosophy

Nu draws inspiration from projects like PowerShell, functional programming languages, and modern CLI tools.
Rather than thinking of files and data as raw streams of text, Nu looks at each input as something with structure.
For example, when you list the contents of a directory what you get back is a table of rows, where each row represents an item in that directory.
These values can be piped through a series of steps, in a series of commands called a &#039;pipeline&#039;.

### Pipelines

In Unix, it&#039;s common to pipe between commands to split up a sophisticated command over multiple steps.
Nu takes this a step further and builds heavily on the idea of _pipelines_.
As in the Unix philosophy, Nu allows commands to output to stdout and read from stdin.
Additionally, commands can output structured data (you can think of this as a third kind of stream).
Commands that work in the pipeline fit into one of three categories:

-   Commands that produce a stream (e.g., `ls`)
-   Commands that filter a stream (e.g., `where type == &quot;dir&quot;`)
-   Commands that consume the output of the pipeline (e.g., `table`)

Commands are separated by the pipe symbol (`|`) to denote a pipeline flowing left to right.

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot; | table
# =&gt; ╭────┬──────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────╮
# =&gt; │ #  │   name   │ type │  size   │   modified    │
# =&gt; ├────┼──────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┤
# =&gt; │  0 │ .cargo   │ dir  │     0 B │ 9 minutes ago │
# =&gt; │  1 │ assets   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  2 │ crates   │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  3 │ docker   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  4 │ docs     │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  5 │ images   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  6 │ pkg_mgrs │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  7 │ samples  │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  8 │ src      │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  9 │ target   │ dir  │     0 B │ a day ago     │
# =&gt; │ 10 │ tests    │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │ 11 │ wix      │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; ╰────┴──────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────╯
```

Because most of the time you&#039;ll want to see the output of a pipeline, `table` is assumed.
We could have also written the above:

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot;
```

Being able to use the same commands and compose them differently is an important philosophy in Nu.
For example, we could use the built-in `ps` command to get a list of the running processes, using the same `where` as above.

```shell
ps | where cpu &gt; 0
# =&gt; ╭───┬───────┬───────────┬───────┬───────────┬───────────╮
# =&gt; │ # │  pid  │   name    │  cpu  │    mem    │  virtual  │
# =&gt; ├───┼───────┼───────────┼───────┼───────────┼───────────┤
# =&gt; │ 0 │  2240 │ Slack.exe │ 16.40 │ 178.3 MiB │ 232.6 MiB │
# =&gt; │ 1 │ 16948 │ Slack.exe │ 16.32 │ 205.0 MiB │ 197.9 MiB │
# =&gt; │ 2 │ 17700 │ nu.exe    │  3.77 │  26.1 MiB │   8.8 MiB │
# =&gt; ╰───┴───────┴───────────┴───────┴───────────┴───────────╯
```

### Opening files

Nu can load file and URL contents as raw text or structured data (if it recognizes the format).
For example, you can load a .toml file as structured data and explore it:

```shell
open Cargo.toml
# =&gt; ╭──────────────────┬────────────────────╮
# =&gt; │ bin              │ [table 1 row]      │
# =&gt; │ dependencies     │ {record 25 fields} │
# =&gt; │ dev-dependencies │ {record 8 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ features         │ {record 10 fields} │
# =&gt; │ package          │ {record 13 fields} │
# =&gt; │ patch            │ {record 1 field}   │
# =&gt; │ profile          │ {record 3 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ target           │ {record 3 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ workspace        │ {record 1 field}   │
# =&gt; ╰──────────────────┴────────────────────╯
```

We can pipe this into a command that gets the contents of one of the columns:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package
# =&gt; ╭───────────────┬────────────────────────────────────╮
# =&gt; │ authors       │ [list 1 item]                      │
# =&gt; │ default-run   │ nu                                 │
# =&gt; │ description   │ A new type of shell                │
# =&gt; │ documentation │ https://www.nushell.sh/book/       │
# =&gt; │ edition       │ 2018                               │
# =&gt; │ exclude       │ [list 1 item]                      │
# =&gt; │ homepage      │ https://www.nushell.sh             │
# =&gt; │ license       │ MIT                                │
# =&gt; │ metadata      │ {record 1 field}                   │
# =&gt; │ name          │ nu                                 │
# =&gt; │ repository    │ https://github.com/nushell/nushell │
# =&gt; │ rust-version  │ 1.60                               │
# =&gt; │ version       │ 0.72.0                             │
# =&gt; ╰───────────────┴────────────────────────────────────╯
```

And if needed we can drill down further:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package.version
# =&gt; 0.72.0
```

### Plugins

Nu supports plugins that offer additional functionality to the shell and follow the same structured data model that built-in commands use. There are a few examples in the `crates/nu_plugins_*` directories.

Plugins are binaries that are available in your path and follow a `nu_plugin_*` naming convention.
These binaries interact with nu via a simple JSON-RPC protocol where the command identifies itself and passes along its configuration, making it available for use.
If the plugin is a filter, data streams to it one element at a time, and it can stream data back in return via stdin/stdout.
If the plugin is a sink, it is given the full vector of final data and is given free reign over stdin/stdout to use as it pleases.

The [awesome-nu repo](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu#plugins) lists a variety of nu-plugins while the [showcase repo](https://github.com/nushell/showcase) *shows* off informative blog posts that have been written about Nushell along with videos that highlight technical
topics that have been presented.

## Goals

Nu adheres closely to a set of goals that make up its design philosophy. As features are added, they are checked against these goals.

-   First and foremost, Nu is cross-platform. Commands and techniques should work across platforms and Nu has [first-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

-   Nu ensures compatibility with existing platform-specific executables.

-   Nu&#039;s workflow and tools should have the usability expected of modern software in 2022 (and beyond).

-   Nu views data as either structured or unstructured. It is a structured shell like PowerShell.

-   Finally, Nu views data functionally. Rather than using mutation, pipelines act as a means to load, change, and save data without mutable state.

- 🐍 Installable via `pip`
- 🛠️ `pyproject.toml` support
- 🤝 Python 3.13 compatibility
- ⚖️ Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- 📏 Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ⌨️ First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/) for
    [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028), lead
developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.11.0
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`)  codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

# Your procedural toolbox for 2D content creation

**Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics engine, [available now](https://editor.graphite.rs) in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.**

Having begun life as a vector editor, Graphite continues evolving into a generalized, all-in-one graphics toolbox that&#039;s built more like a game engine than a conventional creative app. The editor&#039;s tools wrap its node graph core, providing user-friendly workflows for vector, raster, and beyond. Photo editing, motion graphics, digital painting, desktop publishing, and VFX compositing are additional competencies from the [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#roadmap) making Graphite into a highly versatile content creation tool.

## Author Notes

I&#039;ve been using this as my daily driver since November 2019. It should be relatively stable, but I&#039;m
still working out some kinks and ironing out some cross platform issues. In general it should be
usable at this point, and if it isn&#039;t I consider that a bug and appreciate a report in the issues!
Any help and ideas are also greatly appreciated.

I&#039;m also very interested in suggestions code quality/style wise when it comes to Rust. I&#039;m pretty
new to the language and appreciate any critiques that you might have to offer. I won&#039;t take all of
them, but I promise to consider anything you might have to offer.

[![License: MIT OR Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/clippy.svg)](#license)

A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) code.

[There are over 750 lints included in this crate!](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html)

Lints are divided into categories, each with a default [lint level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html).
You can choose how much Clippy is supposed to ~~annoy~~ help you by changing the lint level by category.

| Category              | Description                                                                         | Default level |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `clippy::all`         | all lints that are on by default (correctness, suspicious, style, complexity, perf) | **warn/deny** |
| `clippy::correctness` | code that is outright wrong or useless                                              | **deny**      |
| `clippy::suspicious`  | code that is most likely wrong or useless                                           | **warn**      |
| `clippy::style`       | code that should be written in a more idiomatic way                                 | **warn**      |
| `clippy::complexity`  | code that does something simple but in a complex way                                | **warn**      |
| `clippy::perf`        | code that can be written to run faster                                              | **warn**      |
| `clippy::pedantic`    | lints which are rather strict or have occasional false positives                    | allow         |
| `clippy::restriction` | lints which prevent the use of language and library features[^restrict]             | allow         |
| `clippy::nursery`     | new lints that are still under development                                          | allow         |
| `clippy::cargo`       | lints for the cargo manifest                                                        | allow         |

More to come, please [file an issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues) if you have ideas!

The `restriction` category should, *emphatically*, not be enabled as a whole. The contained
lints may lint against perfectly reasonable code, may not have an alternative suggestion,
and may contradict any other lints (including other categories). Lints should be considered
on a case-by-case basis before enabling.

[^restrict]: Some use cases for `restriction` lints include:
    - Strict coding styles (e.g. [`clippy::else_if_without_else`]).
    - Additional restrictions on CI (e.g. [`clippy::todo`]).
    - Preventing panicking in certain functions (e.g. [`clippy::unwrap_used`]).
    - Running a lint only on a subset of code (e.g. `#[forbid(clippy::float_arithmetic)]` on a module).

[`clippy::else_if_without_else`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#else_if_without_else
[`clippy::todo`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#todo
[`clippy::unwrap_used`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#unwrap_used

## Usage

Below are instructions on how to use Clippy as a cargo subcommand,
in projects that do not use cargo, or in Travis CI.

### As a cargo subcommand (`cargo clippy`)

One way to use Clippy is by installing Clippy through rustup as a cargo
subcommand.

#### Step 1: Install Rustup

You can install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) on supported platforms. This will help
us install Clippy and its dependencies.

If you already have Rustup installed, update to ensure you have the latest
Rustup and compiler:

```terminal
rustup update
```

#### Step 2: Install Clippy

Once you have rustup and the latest stable release (at least Rust 1.29) installed, run the following command:

```terminal
rustup component add clippy
```

If it says that it can&#039;t find the `clippy` component, please run `rustup self update`.

#### Step 3: Run Clippy

Now you can run Clippy by invoking the following command:

```terminal
cargo clippy
```

#### Automatically applying Clippy suggestions

Clippy can automatically apply some lint suggestions, just like the compiler. Note that `--fix` implies
`--all-targets`, so it can fix as much code as it can.

```terminal
cargo clippy --fix
```

#### Workspaces

All the usual workspace options should work with Clippy. For example the following command
will run Clippy on the `example` crate:

```terminal
cargo clippy -p example
```

As with `cargo check`, this includes dependencies that are members of the workspace, like path dependencies.
If you want to run Clippy **only** on the given crate, use the `--no-deps` option like this:

```terminal
cargo clippy -p example -- --no-deps
```

### Using `clippy-driver`

Clippy can also be used in projects that do not use cargo. To do so, run `clippy-driver`
with the same arguments you use for `rustc`. For example:

```terminal
clippy-driver --edition 2018 -Cpanic=abort foo.rs
```

Note that `clippy-driver` is designed for running Clippy only and should not be used as a general
replacement for `rustc`. `clippy-driver` may produce artifacts that are not optimized as expected,
for example.

### Travis CI

You can add Clippy to Travis CI in the same way you use it locally:

```yaml
language: rust
rust:
  - stable
  - beta
before_script:
  - rustup component add clippy
script:
  - cargo clippy
  # if you want the build job to fail when encountering warnings, use
  - cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  # in order to also check tests and non-default crate features, use
  - cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  - cargo test
  # etc.
```

Note that adding `-D warnings` will cause your build to fail if **any** warnings are found in your code.
That includes warnings found by rustc (e.g. `dead_code`, etc.). If you want to avoid this and only cause
an error for Clippy warnings, use `#![deny(clippy::all)]` in your code or `-D clippy::all` on the command
line. (You can swap `clippy::all` with the specific lint category you are targeting.)

## Configuration

### Allowing/denying lints

You can add options to your code to `allow`/`warn`/`deny` Clippy lints:

* the whole set of `Warn` lints using the `clippy` lint group (`#![deny(clippy::all)]`).
  Note that `rustc` has additional [lint groups](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/groups.html).

* all lints using both the `clippy` and `clippy::pedantic` lint groups (`#![deny(clippy::all)]`,
  `#![deny(clippy::pedantic)]`). Note that `clippy::pedantic` contains some very aggressive
  lints prone to false positives.

* only some lints (`#![deny(clippy::single_match, clippy::box_vec)]`, etc.)

* `allow`/`warn`/`deny` can be limited to a single function or module using `#[allow(...)]`, etc.

Note: `allow` means to suppress the lint for your code. With `warn` the lint
will only emit a warning, while with `deny` the lint will emit an error, when
triggering for your code. An error causes Clippy to exit with an error code, so
is useful in scripts like CI/CD.

If you do not want to include your lint levels in your code, you can globally
enable/disable lints by passing extra flags to Clippy during the run:

To allow `lint_name`, run

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -A clippy::lint_name
```

And to warn on `lint_name`, run

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::lint_name
```

This also works with lint groups. For example, you
can run Clippy with warnings for all lints enabled:

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic
```

If you care only about a single lint, you can allow all others and then explicitly warn on
the lint(s) you are interested in:

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -A clippy::all -W clippy::useless_format -W clippy::...
```

### Configure the behavior of some lints

Some lints can be configured in a TOML file named `clippy.toml` or `.clippy.toml`. It contains a basic `variable =
value` mapping e.g.

```toml
avoid-breaking-exported-api = false
disallowed-names = [&quot;toto&quot;, &quot;tata&quot;, &quot;titi&quot;]
```

The [table of configurations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/clippy/lint_configuration.html)
contains all config values, their default, and a list of lints they affect.
Each [configurable lint](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#Configuration)
, also contains information about these values.

For configurations that are a list type with default values such as
[disallowed-names](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#disallowed_names),
you can use the unique value `&quot;..&quot;` to extend the default values instead of replacing them.

```toml
# default of disallowed-names is [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;quux&quot;]
disallowed-names = [&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;..&quot;] # -&gt; [&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;quux&quot;]
```

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; `clippy.toml` or `.clippy.toml` cannot be used to allow/deny lints.

To deactivate the “for further information visit *lint-link*” message you can
define the `CLIPPY_DISABLE_DOCS_LINKS` environment variable.

### Specifying the minimum supported Rust version

Projects that intend to support old versions of Rust can disable lints pertaining to newer features by
specifying the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) in the Clippy configuration file.

```toml
msrv = &quot;1.30.0&quot;
```

Alternatively, the [`rust-version` field](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field)
in the `Cargo.toml` can be used.

```toml
# Cargo.toml
rust-version = &quot;1.30&quot;
```

The MSRV can also be specified as an attribute, like below.

```rust,ignore
#![feature(custom_inner_attributes)]
#![clippy::msrv = &quot;1.30.0&quot;]

fn main() {
  ...
}
```

You can also omit the patch version when specifying the MSRV, so `msrv = 1.30`
is equivalent to `msrv = 1.30.0`.

Note: `custom_inner_attributes` is an unstable feature, so it has to be enabled explicitly.

Lints that recognize this configuration option can be found [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#msrv)

to test configuration validity and test input simulation.

## Why is this useful?

Imagine if, instead of pressing Shift to type uppercase letters, we had giant
keyboards with separate keys for lowercase and uppercase letters. I hope we can
all agree: that would be a terrible user experience!

A way to think of how Shift keys work is that they switch your input to another
layer of functionality where you now type uppercase letters and symbols
instead of lowercase letters and numbers.

What kanata allows you to do is take this alternate layer concept that Shift
keys have and apply it to any key. You can then customize what those layers do
to suit your exact needs and workflows.

## Usage

Running kanata currently does not start it in a background process.
You will need to keep the window that starts kanata running to keep kanata active.
Some tips for running kanata in the background:

- Windows: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/193
- Linux: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/130#discussioncomment-10227272
- Run from tray icon: [kanata-tray](https://github.com/rszyma/kanata-tray)

### Pre-built executables

See the
[releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
for executables and instructions.

### Build it yourself

This project uses the latest Rust stable toolchain. If you installed the
Rust toolchain using `rustup`, e.g. by using the instructions from the
[official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started),
you can get the latest stable toolchain with `rustup update stable`.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

Using `cargo install`:

    cargo install kanata

    # On Linux and macOS, this may not work without `sudo`, see below
    kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Linux:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is used because kanata opens /dev/ files
    #
    # See below if you want to avoid needing sudo:
    # https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/wiki/Avoid-using-sudo-on-Linux
    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Windows.

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive
    target\debug\kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in macOS:

For macOS version 11 and newer: Install the [Karabiner VirtualHiDDevice Driver](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/blob/main/dist/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice-5.0.0.pkg).

To activate it:

`/Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager activate`

For macOS version 10 and older:
Install the [Karabiner kernel extension](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice).

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is needed to gain permission to intercept the keyboard

    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

The full configuration guide is [found here](./docs/config.adoc).

Sample configuration files are found in [cfg_samples](./cfg_samples). The
[simple.kbd](./cfg_samples/simple.kbd) file contains a basic configuration file
that is hopefully easy to understand but does not contain all features. The
`kanata.kbd` contains an example of all features with documentation. The
release assets also have a `kanata.kbd` file that is tested to work with that
release. All key names can be found in the [keys module](./src/keys/mod.rs),
and you can also define your own key names.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Feature flags

When either building yourself or using `cargo install`,
you can add feature flags that
enable functionality that is turned off by default.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

If you want to enable the `cmd` actions,
add the flag `--features cmd`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd
cargo install --features cmd
```

On Windows,
if you want to compile a binary that uses the Interception driver,
you should add the flag `--features interception_driver`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features interception_driver
cargo install --features interception_driver
```

To combine multiple flags,
use a single `--features` flag
and use a comma to separate the features.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd,interception_driver
cargo install --features cmd,interception_driver
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## What does the name mean?

I wanted a &quot;k&quot; word since this relates to keyboards. According to Wikipedia,
kanata is an indigenous Iroquoian word meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot; and is
the origin of Canada&#039;s name.

There&#039;s also PPT✧.

## Motivation

TLDR: QMK features but for any keyboard, not just fancy mechanical ones.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Long version&lt;/summary&gt;

I have a few keyboards that run [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/). QMK allows the
user to customize the functionality of their keyboard to their heart&#039;s content.

One great use case of QMK is its ability map keys so that they overlap with the
home row keys but are accessible on another layer. I won&#039;t comment on
productivity, but I find this greatly helps with my keyboard comfort.

For example, these keys are on the right side of the keyboard:

    7 8 9
    u i o
    j k l
    m , .

On one layer I have arrow keys in the same position, and on another layer I
have a numpad.

    arrows:       numpad:
    - - -         7 8 9
    - ↑ -         4 5 6
    ← ↓ →         1 2 3
    - - -         0 * .

One could add as many customizations as one likes to improve comfort, speed,
etc. Personally my main motivator is comfort due to a repetitive strain injury
in the past.

However, QMK doesn&#039;t run everywhere. In fact, it doesn&#039;t run on **most**
hardware you can get. You can&#039;t get it to run on a laptop keyboard or any
mainstream office keyboard. I believe that the comfort and empowerment QMK
provides should be available to anyone with a computer on their existing
hardware, instead of having to purchase an enthusiast mechanical keyboard
(which are admittedly very nice — I own a few — but can be costly).

The best alternative solution that I found for keyboards that don&#039;t run QMK was
[kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad). This is an excellent project
and I recommend it if you want to try something similar.

The reason for this project&#039;s existence is that kmonad is written in Haskell
and I have no idea how to begin contributing to a Haskell project. From an
outsider&#039;s perspective I think Haskell is a great language but I really can&#039;t
wrap my head around it. And there are a few [outstanding issues](./docs/kmonad_comparison.md)
at the time of writing that make kmonad suboptimal for my personal workflows.

This project is written in Rust because Rust is my favourite programming
language and the prior work of the awesome [keyberon crate](https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon)
exists.
&lt;/details&gt;

## Similar Projects

The most similar project is [kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad),
which served as the inspiration for kanata. [Here&#039;s a comparison document](./docs/kmonad_comparison.md).

&lt;/a&gt;
Juspay, founded in 2012, is a global leader in payment orchestration and checkout solutions, trusted by 400+ leading enterprises and brands worldwide. Hyperswitch is Juspay&#039;s new generation of composable, commercial open-source payments platform for merchant and brands. It is an enterprise-grade, transparent and modular payments platform designed to provide digital businesses access to the best payments infrastructure.

Here are the key components of Hyperswitch that deliver the whole solution:

* [Hyperswitch Backend](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch): Hyperswitch backend enables seamless payment processing with comprehensive support for various payment flows - authorization, authentication, void and capture workflows along with robust management of post-payment processes like refunds and chargeback handling. Additionally, Hyperswitch supports non-payment use cases by enabling connections with external FRM or authentication providers as part of the payment flow. The backend optimizes payment routing with customizable workflows, including success rate-based routing, rule-based routing, volume distribution, fallback handling, and intelligent retry mechanisms for failed payments based on specific error codes.

* [SDK (Frontend)](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web): The SDK, available for web, [Android, and iOS](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-client-core), unifies the payment experience across various methods such as cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers, and more, while supporting the diverse payment flows of underlying PSPs. When paired with the locker, it surfaces the user&#039;s saved payment methods.    

* [Control Center](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-control-center): The Control Center enables users to manage the entire payments stack without any coding. It allows the creation of workflows for routing, payment retries, and defining conditions to invoke 3DS, fraud risk management (FRM), and surcharge modules. The Control Center provides access to transaction, refund, and chargeback operations across all integrated PSPs, transaction-level logs for initial debugging, and detailed analytics and insights into payment performance.

Hyperswitch serves as a well-architected designed reference platform, built on best-in-class design principles, empowering businesses to own and customize their payment stack. It provides a reusable core payments stack that can be tailored to specific requirements while relying on the Hyperswitch team for enhancements, support, and continuous innovation.

### Our Values

1. Embrace Payments Diversity: It will drive innovation in the ecosystem in
   multiple ways.
2. Make it Open Source: Increases trust; Improves the quality and reusability of
   software.
3. Be community driven: It enables participatory design and development.
4. Build it like Systems Software: This sets a high bar for Reliability,
   Security and Performance SLAs.
5. Maximise Value Creation: For developers, customers &amp; partners.

# Rnote

&gt; Sketch and take handwritten notes.  

Rnote is an open-source vector-based drawing app for sketching, handwritten notes and to annotate documents and pictures.
It is targeted at students, teachers and those who own a drawing tablet and provides features like Pdf and picture import and export,
an infinite canvas and an adaptive UI for big and small screens.

Written in Rust and GTK4.

**Features**

- Adaptive UI focused on stylus input
- Pressure-sensitive stylus input with different and configurable stroke styles
- Create many different shapes with the shape tool
- Move, rotate, resize and modify existing content with the selection tool
- Different document expansion layouts ( fixed pages, continuous vertical, infinite in every direction, .. )
- Customizable background colors, patterns, sizes
- Customizable page format
- (Optional) pen sounds
- Reconfigurable stylus button shortcuts
- An integrated workspace browser for quick access to related files
- Drag &amp; Drop, clipboard support
- Pdf, Bitmap and Svg image import
- Documents can be exported to Svg, Pdf and Xopp. Document pages and selections to Svg, Png and Jpeg.
- Save and load the documents in the native `.rnote` file format
- Tabs to work on multiple documents at the same time

**Disclaimer**

The file format is still unstable. It might change and break compatibility between versions.

## Website

Rnote has a project website: [rnote.flxzt.net](https://rnote.flxzt.net/)

## Installation

### Linux

Download the official flatpak on Flathub [here](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.flxzt.rnote).

&lt;div align=&quot;start&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#039;https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.flxzt.rnote&#039;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; alt=&#039;Download on Flathub&#039; src=&#039;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flxzt/rnote/main/misc/assets/flathub-badge.svg&#039;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;

### MacOS

Thanks to @dehesselle the app is available on MacOS as an app bundle.  
Check out the [repository](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle/rnote_macos), the latest release can be downloaded [here](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle/rnote_macos/-/releases/permalink/latest).

&lt;div align=&quot;start&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#039;https://gitlab.com/dehesselle/rnote_macos/-/releases/permalink/latest&#039;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;150&quot; alt=&#039;Download MacOS app bundle&#039; src=&#039;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flxzt/rnote/main/misc/assets/rnote-macos-app-bundle-badge.png&#039;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;

### Windows

Download the Windows installer from the latest release which can be found [here](https://github.com/flxzt/rnote/releases/latest).

&lt;div align=&quot;start&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/flxzt/rnote/releases/latest&#039;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; alt=&#039;Download Windows installer&#039; src=&#039;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flxzt/rnote/main/misc/assets/windows-installer-badge.svg&#039;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Install using [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/f/flxzt/rnote):

```
winget install flxzt.rnote
```

### Downgrading

Because the file format still is unstable, downgrading to a specific version might be necessary.

List all available past versions on flathub:

```bash
flatpak remote-info --log flathub com.github.flxzt.rnote
```

Pick the commit from the desired version and downgrade with:

```bash
sudo flatpak update --commit=&lt;commit-hash&gt; com.github.flxzt.rnote 
```

After downgrading, the flatpak version can be pinned or unpinned with:

```
$ flatpak mask com.github.flxzt.rnote
$ flatpak mask --remove com.github.flxzt.rnote
```

To update to the latest version again, unpin and run `flatpak update`.

## Pitfalls &amp; Known Issues

* Drag &amp; Drop not working -  
    Make sure Rnote has permissions to the locations you are dragging files from. Can be granted in Flatseal (a Flatpak permissions manager)

* Odd location for current file -  
    When the directory displayed in the header title is something like `/run/user/1000/../`, rnote does not have permissions to access the directory. Again, granting them in Flatseal fixes this issue.

* Stylus buttons move canvas / are not functional -  
    Make sure that the `xf86-input-wacom`, drivers on X11 and `libinput` on Wayland and `libwacom` are installed and loaded.

* While hovering with the stylus, other input events are blocked in some regions of the screen -  
    Supposed to be palm rejection, but might be undesirable. If there is a left- / righthanded system tablet setting, make sure it is set correctly. Rnote can&#039;t disable this unfortunately. ( discussed in issue [#329](https://github.com/flxzt/rnote/issues/329) )

* One of the stylus buttons shortcut mapping does not work as intended -  
On some devices one stylus button is mapped to a dedicated &quot;Eraser&quot; mode (which is the back-side on other styli). The buttons in the shortcuts settings could then be inconsistent ( the secondary / upper button is actually the primary / lower button , or reverse ). To change the tool that is mapped to this &quot;Eraser&quot; mode, do the following:  
    * Hover over the canvas, and press and hold the button that is suspected to be mapped to the &quot;Eraser&quot; mode
    * Switch to the desired pen style while keeping the button pressed
    * When releasing the pressed button, it should switch back to the previous pen style
    * The pen style in the &quot;Eraser&quot; mode should now be remembered

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ˈdiːnoʊ/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found in the manual
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/references/contributing/building_from_source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

 &lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFLplusplus/Website/main/static/libafl_logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;LibAFL logo&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; heigh=&quot;250&quot;&gt;

Advanced Fuzzing Library - Slot your own fuzzers together and extend their features using Rust.

LibAFL is a collection of reusable pieces of fuzzers, written in Rust, it gives you many of the benefits of an off-the-shelf fuzzer, while being completely customizable.
Some highlight features currently include:
- `fast`: We do everything we can at compile time, keeping runtime overhead minimal. Users reach 120k execs/sec in frida-mode on a phone (using all cores).
- `scalable`: `Low Level Message Passing`, `LLMP` for short, allows LibAFL to scale almost linearly over cores, and via TCP to multiple machines.
- `adaptable`: You can replace each part of LibAFL. For example, `BytesInput` is just one potential form input:
feel free to add an AST-based input for structured fuzzing, and more.
- `multi platform`: LibAFL was confirmed to work on *Windows*, *MacOS*, *Linux*, and *Android* on *x86_64* and *aarch64*. `LibAFL` can be built in `no_std` mode to inject LibAFL into obscure targets like embedded devices and hypervisors.
- `bring your own target`: We support binary-only modes, like Frida-Mode, as well as multiple compilation passes for sourced-based instrumentation. Of course it&#039;s easy to add custom instrumentation backends.

## Core concepts

LibAFL is fast, multi-platform, no_std compatible, and scales over cores and machines. It offers a main crate that provide building blocks for custom fuzzers, [libafl](./libafl), a library containing common code that can be used for targets instrumentation, [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets), and a library providing facilities to wrap compilers, [libafl_cc](./libafl_cc). It offers integrations with popular instrumentation frameworks. At the moment, the supported backends are:
+ `SanitizerCoverage`, in [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets)
+ `Frida`, in [libafl_frida](./libafl_frida)
+ `QEMU` user-mode and system mode, including hooks for emulation, in [libafl_qemu](./libafl_qemu)
+ `TinyInst`, in [libafl_tinyinst](./libafl_tinyinst) by [elbiazo](https://github.com/elbiazo)

## Building and installing

#### Install the Dependencies
- **The Rust development language**
    - We highly recommend *not* to use e.g. your Linux distribution package as this is likely outdated. So rather install Rust directly, instructions can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **LLVM tools**
    - The LLVM tools (including clang, clang++) are needed (newer than LLVM 15.0.0 up to LLVM 18.1.3) If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, again, we highly recommmend that you install the package from [here](https://apt.llvm.org/)
    - (In `libafl_concolic`, we only support LLVM version newer than 18)
- Just:
    - We use [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to build the fuzzers in `fuzzers/` directory. You can find instructions to install it in your environment [in the Just Programmer&#039;s Manual](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html).
 
#### Clone the LibAFL repository with
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL
```
#### Build the library using
```sh
cargo build --release
```
#### Build the API documentation with
```sh
cargo doc
```
#### Browse the LibAFL book (WIP!) with (requires [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html))
```sh
cd docs &amp;&amp; mdbook serve
```
## Getting started 
We collect all example fuzzers in [`./fuzzers`](./fuzzers/).
Be sure to read their documentation (and source), this is *the natural way to get started!*
```sh
just run
```
You can run each example fuzzer with this following command, as long as the fuzzer directory has a `Justfile` file. The best-tested fuzzer is [`./fuzzers/inprocess/libfuzzer_libpng`](./fuzzers/inprocess/libfuzzer_libpng), a multicore libfuzzer-like fuzzer using LibAFL for a libpng harness.
