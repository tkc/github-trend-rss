# Pyrefly: A fast type checker and IDE for Python

Currently under active development with known issues. Please open an issue if
you find bugs.

Pyrefly is a fast type checker for Python. It&#039;s designed to replace the existing
Pyre type checker at Meta by the end of 2025. This README describes basic usage.
See the [Pyrefly website](https://pyrefly.org) for full documentation and a tool
for checking code.

### Getting Started

Pyrefly aims to increase development velocity with IDE features and by checking
your Python code.

- Try out pyrefly in your browser: [Sandbox](https://pyrefly.org/sandbox/)
- Get the command-line tool: `pip install pyrefly`
- Get the VSCode extension:
  [Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly)

### Key Features:

- Type Inference: Pyrefly infers types in most locations, apart from function
  parameters. It can infer types of variables and return types.
- Flow Types: Pyrefly can understand your program&#039;s control flow to refine
  static types.
- Incrementality: Pyrefly aims for large-scale incrementality at the module
  level, with optimized checking and parallelism.

## Getting Involved

If you have questions or would like to report a bug, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues).

See our
[contributing guide](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for information on how to contribute to Pyrefly.

## Choices

There are a number of choices when writing a Python type checker. We are taking
inspiration from [Pyre1](https://pyre-check.org/),
[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) and
[MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Some notable choices:

- We infer types in most locations, apart from parameters to functions. We do
  infer types of variables and return types. As an example,
  `def foo(x): return True` would result in something equivalent to had you
  written `def foo(x: Any) -&gt; bool: ...`.
- We attempt to infer the type of `[]` to however it is used first, then fix it
  after. For example `xs = []; xs.append(1); xs.append(&quot;&quot;)` will infer that
  `xs: List[int]` and then error on the final statement.
- We use flow types which refine static types, e.g. `x: int = 4` will both know
  that `x` has type `int`, but also that the immediately next usage of `x` will
  be aware the type is `Literal[4]`.
- We aim for large-scale incrementality (at the module level) and optimised
  checking with parallelism, aiming to use the advantages of Rust to keep the
  code a bit simpler.
- We expect large strongly connected components of modules, and do not attempt
  to take advantage of a DAG-shape in the source code.

## Design

There are many nuances of design that change on a regular basis. But the basic
substrate on which the checker is built involves three steps:

1. Figure out what each module exports. That requires solving all `import *`
   statements transitively.
2. For each module in isolation, convert it to bindings, dealing with all
   statements and scope information (both static and flow).
3. Solve those bindings, which may require the solutions of bindings in other
   modules.

If we encounter unknowable information (e.g. recursion) we use `Type::Var` to
insert placeholders which are filled in later.

For each module, we solve the steps sequentially and completely. In particular,
we do not try and solve a specific identifier first (like
[Rosyln](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)), and do not used fine-grained
incrementality (like [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
using [Salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa)). Instead, we aim for raw
performance and a simpler module-centric design - there&#039;s no need to solve a
single binding in isolation if solving all bindings in a module is fast enough.

### Example of bindings

Given the program:

```python
1: x: int = 4
2: print(x)
```

We might produce the bindings:

- `define int@0` = `from builtins import int`
- `define x@1` = `4: int@0`
- `use x@2` = `x@1`
- `anon @2` = `print(x@2)`
- `export x` = `x@2`

Of note:

- The keys are things like `define` (the definition of something), `use` (a
  usage of a thing) and `anon` (a statement we need to type check, but don&#039;t
  care about the result of).
- In many cases the value of a key refers to other keys.
- Some keys are imported from other modules, via `export` keys and `import`
  values.
- In order to disamiguate identifiers we use the textual position at which they
  occur (in the example I&#039;ve used `@line`, but in reality its the byte offset in
  the file).

### Example of `Var`

Given the program:

```python
1: x = 1
2: while test():
3:     x = x
4: print(x)
```

We end up with the bindings:

- `x@1` = `1`
- `x@3` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`
- `x@4` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`

The expression `phi` is the join point of the two values, e.g. `phi(int, str)`
would be `int | str`. We skip the distinction between `define` and `use`, since
it is not necessary for this example.

When solving `x@3` we encounter recursion. Operationally:

- We start solving `x@3`.
- That requires us to solve `x@1`.
- We solve `x@1` to be `Literal[1]`
- We start solving `x@3`. But we are currently solving `x@3`, so we invent a
  fresh `Var` (let&#039;s call it `?1`) and return that.
- We conclude that `x@3` must be `Literal[1] | ?1`.
- Since `?1` was introduced by `x@3` we record that `?1 = Literal[1] | ?1`. We
  can take the upper reachable bound of that and conclude that
  `?1 = Literal[1]`.
- We simplify `x@3` to just `Literal[1]`.

# What&#039;s Hurl?

Hurl is a command line tool that runs &lt;b&gt;HTTP requests&lt;/b&gt; defined in a simple &lt;b&gt;plain text format&lt;/b&gt;.

It can chain requests, capture values and evaluate queries on headers and body response. Hurl is very
versatile: it can be used for both &lt;b&gt;fetching data&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;testing HTTP&lt;/b&gt; sessions.

Hurl makes it easy to work with &lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt; content, &lt;b&gt;REST / SOAP / GraphQL&lt;/b&gt; APIs, or any other &lt;b&gt;XML / JSON&lt;/b&gt; based APIs. 

```hurl
# Get home:
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Captures]
csrf_token: xpath &quot;string(//meta[@name=&#039;_csrf_token&#039;]/@content)&quot;


# Do login!
POST https://example.org/login?user=toto&amp;password=1234
X-CSRF-TOKEN: {{csrf_token}}
HTTP 302
```

Chaining multiple requests is easy:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/health
GET https://example.org/api/step1
GET https://example.org/api/step2
GET https://example.org/api/step3
```

# Also an HTTP Test Tool

Hurl can run HTTP requests but can also be used to &lt;b&gt;test HTTP responses&lt;/b&gt;.
Different types of queries and predicates are supported, from [XPath] and [JSONPath] on body response,
to assert on status code and response headers.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://hurl.dev/player.html?id=starwars&amp;speed=3&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/img/poster-starwars.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Hurl Demo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


It is well adapted for &lt;b&gt;REST / JSON APIs&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;4568&quot;,
    &quot;evaluate&quot;: true
}
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
header &quot;X-Frame-Options&quot; == &quot;SAMEORIGIN&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.status&quot; == &quot;RUNNING&quot;    # Check the status code
jsonpath &quot;$.tests&quot; count == 25      # Check the number of items
jsonpath &quot;$.id&quot; matches /\d{4}/     # Check the format of the id
```

&lt;b&gt;HTML content&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
xpath &quot;normalize-space(//head/title)&quot; == &quot;Hello world!&quot;
```

&lt;b&gt;GraphQL&lt;/b&gt; 

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: &quot;1000&quot;) {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
HTTP 200
~~~

and even &lt;b&gt;SOAP APIs&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
POST https://example.org/InStock
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
SOAPAction: &quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot; xmlns:m=&quot;https://example.org&quot;&gt;
  &lt;soap:Header&gt;&lt;/soap:Header&gt;
  &lt;soap:Body&gt;
    &lt;m:GetStockPrice&gt;
      &lt;m:StockName&gt;GOOG&lt;/m:StockName&gt;
    &lt;/m:GetStockPrice&gt;
  &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
HTTP 200
```

Hurl can also be used to test the &lt;b&gt;performance&lt;/b&gt; of HTTP endpoints

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/v1/pets
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
duration &lt; 1000  # Duration in ms
```

And check response bytes

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
sha256 == hex,039058c6f2c0cb492c533b0a4d14ef77cc0f78abccced5287d84a1a2011cfb81;
```

Finally, Hurl is easy to &lt;b&gt;integrate in CI/CD&lt;/b&gt;, with text, JUnit, TAP and HTML reports

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: light)&quot; srcset=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-light.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-dark.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-light.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; alt=&quot;HTML report&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

# Why Hurl?

&lt;ul class=&quot;showcase-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Text Format:&lt;/b&gt; for both devops and developers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast CLI:&lt;/b&gt; a command line for local dev and continuous integration&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single Binary:&lt;/b&gt; easy to install, with no runtime required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

# Powered by curl

Hurl is a lightweight binary written in [Rust]. Under the hood, Hurl HTTP engine is
powered by [libcurl], one of the most powerful and reliable file transfer libraries.
With its text file format, Hurl adds syntactic sugar to run and test HTTP requests,
but it&#039;s still the [curl] that we love: __fast__, __efficient__ and __IPv6 / HTTP/3 ready__.

# Feedbacks

# Samples

To run a sample, edit a file with the sample content, and run Hurl:

```shell
$ vi sample.hurl

GET https://example.org

$ hurl sample.hurl
```

By default, Hurl behaves like [curl] and outputs the last HTTP response&#039;s [entry]. To have a test
oriented output, you can use [`--test` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --test sample.hurl
```

A particular response can be saved with [`[Options] section`](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#options):

```hurl
GET https://example.ord/cats/123
[Options]
output: cat123.txt    # use - to output to stdout
HTTP 200

GET https://example.ord/dogs/567
HTTP 200
```

Finally, Hurl can take files as input, or directories. In the latter case, Hurl will search files with `.hurl` extension recursively.

```shell
$ hurl --test integration/*.hurl
$ hurl --test .
```

You can check [Hurl tests suite] for more samples.

## Getting Data

A simple GET:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
```

Requests can be chained:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/a
GET https://example.org/b
HEAD https://example.org/c
GET https://example.org/c
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#method)

### HTTP Headers

A simple GET with headers:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#headers)

### Query Params

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news
[Query]
order: newest
search: something to search
count: 100
```

Or:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news?order=newest&amp;search=something%20to%20search&amp;count=100
```

&gt; With `[Query]` section, params don&#039;t need to be URL escaped.

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#query-parameters)

### Basic Authentication

```hurl
GET https://example.org/protected
[BasicAuth]
bob: secret
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#basic-authentication)

This is equivalent to construct the request with a [Authorization] header:

```hurl
# Authorization header value can be computed with `echo -n &#039;bob:secret&#039; | base64`
GET https://example.org/protected
Authorization: Basic Ym9iOnNlY3JldA== 
```

Basic authentication section allows per request authentication. If you want to add basic authentication to all the
requests of a Hurl file you could use [`-u/--user` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --user bob:secret login.hurl
```

[`--user`] option can also be set per request:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/login
[Options]
user: bob:secret
HTTP 200

GET https://example.org/login
[Options]
user: alice:secret
HTTP 200
```

### Passing Data between Requests 

[Captures] can be used to pass data from one request to another:

```hurl
POST https://sample.org/orders
HTTP 201
[Captures]
order_id: jsonpath &quot;$.order.id&quot;

GET https://sample.org/orders/{{order_id}}
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/capturing-response.html)

## Sending Data

### Sending HTML Form Data

```hurl
POST https://example.org/contact
[Form]
default: false
token: {{token}}
email: john.doe@rookie.org
number: 33611223344
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#form-parameters)

### Sending Multipart Form Data

```hurl
POST https://example.org/upload
[Multipart]
field1: value1
field2: file,example.txt;
# One can specify the file content type:
field3: file,example.zip; application/zip
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multipart-form-data)

Multipart forms can also be sent with a [multiline string body]:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=&quot;boundary&quot;
```
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;key1&quot;

value1
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;upload1&quot;; filename=&quot;data.txt&quot;
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello World!
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;upload2&quot;; filename=&quot;data.html&quot;
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;div&gt;Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;
--boundary--
```
~~~

In that case, files have to be inlined in the Hurl file.

### Posting a JSON Body

With an inline JSON:

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;456&quot;,
    &quot;evaluate&quot;: true
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#json-body)

With a local file:

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
Content-Type: application/json
file,data.json;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#file-body)

### Templating a JSON Body

```hurl
PUT https://example.org/api/hits
Content-Type: application/json
{
    &quot;key0&quot;: &quot;{{a_string}}&quot;,
    &quot;key1&quot;: {{a_bool}},
    &quot;key2&quot;: {{a_null}},
    &quot;key3&quot;: {{a_number}}
}
```

Variables can be initialized via command line:

```shell
$ hurl --variable a_string=apple \
       --variable a_bool=true \
       --variable a_null=null \
       --variable a_number=42 \
       test.hurl
```

Resulting in a PUT request with the following JSON body:

```
{
    &quot;key0&quot;: &quot;apple&quot;,
    &quot;key1&quot;: true,
    &quot;key2&quot;: null,
    &quot;key3&quot;: 42
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/templates.html)

### Templating a XML Body

Using templates with [XML body] is not currently supported in Hurl. You can use templates in
[XML multiline string body] with variables to send a variable XML body:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/echo/post/xml
```xml
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;Request&gt;
    &lt;Login&gt;{{login}}&lt;/Login&gt;
    &lt;Password&gt;{{password}}&lt;/Password&gt;
&lt;/Request&gt;
```
~~~

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multiline-string-body)

### Using GraphQL Query

A simple GraphQL query:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/starwars/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: &quot;1000&quot;) {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
~~~

A GraphQL query with variables:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/starwars/graphql
```graphql
query Hero($episode: Episode, $withFriends: Boolean!) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends @include(if: $withFriends) {
      name
    }
  }
}

variables {
  &quot;episode&quot;: &quot;JEDI&quot;,
  &quot;withFriends&quot;: false
}
```
~~~

GraphQL queries can also use [Hurl templates].

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#graphql-body)

### Using Dynamic Datas

[Functions] like `newUuid` and `newDate` can be used in templates to create dynamic datas:


A file that creates a dynamic email (i.e `0531f78f-7f87-44be-a7f2-969a1c4e6d97@test.com`):

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/foo
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;,
  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;{{newUuid}}@test.com&quot;
}
```

A file that creates a dynamic query parameter (i.e `2024-12-02T10:35:44.461731Z`):

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/foo
[Query]
date: {{newDate}}
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/templates.html#functions)

## Testing Response

Responses are optional, everything after `HTTP` is part of the response asserts.

```hurl
# A request with (almost) no check:
GET https://foo.com

# A status code check:
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200

# A test on response body
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath &quot;$.state&quot; == &quot;running&quot;
```

### Testing Status Code

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order/435
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#version-status)

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order/435
# Testing status code is in a 200-300 range
HTTP *
[Asserts]
status &gt;= 200
status &lt; 300
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#status-assert)


### Testing Response Headers

Use implicit response asserts to test header values:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#headers)


Or use explicit response asserts with [predicates]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 302
[Asserts]
header &quot;Location&quot; contains &quot;www.example.net&quot;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#header-assert)

Implicit and explicit asserts can be combined:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
[Asserts]
header &quot;Location&quot; contains &quot;www.example.net&quot;
```

### Testing REST APIs

Asserting JSON body response (node values, collection count etc...) with [JSONPath]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order
screencapability: low
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath &quot;$.validated&quot; == true
jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.firstName&quot; == &quot;Franck&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.lastName&quot; == &quot;Herbert&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.hasDevice&quot; == false
jsonpath &quot;$.links&quot; count == 12
jsonpath &quot;$.state&quot; != null
jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches &quot;^order-\\d{8}$&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches /^order-\d{8}$/     # Alternative syntax with regex literal
jsonpath &quot;$.created&quot; isIsoDate
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#jsonpath-assert)


### Testing HTML Response

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
[Asserts]
xpath &quot;string(/html/head/title)&quot; contains &quot;Example&quot; # Check title
xpath &quot;count(//p)&quot; == 2  # Check the number of p
xpath &quot;//p&quot; count == 2  # Similar assert for p
xpath &quot;boolean(count(//h2))&quot; == false  # Check there is no h2  
xpath &quot;//h2&quot; not exists  # Similar assert for h2
xpath &quot;string(//div[1])&quot; matches /Hello.*/
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#xpath-assert)

### Testing Set-Cookie Attributes

```hurl
GET https://example.org/home
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID&quot; == &quot;8400BAFE2F66443613DC38AE3D9D6239&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Value]&quot; == &quot;8400BAFE2F66443613DC38AE3D9D6239&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Expires]&quot; contains &quot;Wed, 13 Jan 2021&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Secure]&quot; exists
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[HttpOnly]&quot; exists
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[SameSite]&quot; == &quot;Lax&quot;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#cookie-assert)

### Testing Bytes Content

Check the SHA-256 response body hash:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
sha256 == hex,039058c6f2c0cb492c533b0a4d14ef77cc0f78abccced5287d84a1a2011cfb81;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#sha-256-assert)

### SSL Certificate

Check the properties of a SSL certificate:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
certificate &quot;Subject&quot; == &quot;CN=example.org&quot;
certificate &quot;Issuer&quot; == &quot;C=US, O=Let&#039;s Encrypt, CN=R3&quot;
certificate &quot;Expire-Date&quot; daysAfterNow &gt; 15
certificate &quot;Serial-Number&quot; matches /[\da-f]+/
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#ssl-certificate-assert)

### Checking Full Body

Use implicit body to test an exact JSON body match:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/cats/123
HTTP 200
{
  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Purrsloud&quot;,
  &quot;species&quot; : &quot;Cat&quot;,
  &quot;favFoods&quot; : [&quot;wet food&quot;, &quot;dry food&quot;, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; food&quot;],
  &quot;birthYear&quot; : 2016,
  &quot;photo&quot; : &quot;https://learnwebcode.github.io/json-example/images/cat-2.jpg&quot;
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#json-body)

Or an explicit assert file:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
body == file,cat.json;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#body-assert)

Implicit asserts supports XML body:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/catalog
HTTP 200
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;catalog&gt;
   &lt;book id=&quot;bk101&quot;&gt;
      &lt;author&gt;Gambardella, Matthew&lt;/author&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XML Developer&#039;s Guide&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;genre&gt;Computer&lt;/genre&gt;

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

## About

* **[Features](https://bevyengine.org):** A quick overview of Bevy&#039;s features.
* **[News](https://bevyengine.org/news/)**: A development blog that covers our progress, plans and shiny new features.

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

See the [installation documentation](docs/install).

## Documentation

## 🚀 Start Contributing

### Prerequisites

- MacOS
  - Xcode 13 or later
  - Brew

### 1. Clone repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-for-command-line.git
```

### 2. Setup
Hassle-free setup:
```shell
npm run setup
```

Or if you&#039;d like to DIY:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Manual Setup&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

### 1. Install platform dependencies

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config jq dpkg curl wget cmake clang libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libdbus-1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev valac libibus-1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev sqlite3 libxdo-dev protobuf-compiler
```
### 2. Install Rust toolchain using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs):

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

For pre-commit hooks, the following commands are required:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install typos-cli
```

For MacOS development make sure the right targets are installed:

```shell
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Setup Python and Node using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Add mise integrations to your shell:

For zsh:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; &quot;${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc&quot;
```

For bash:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
```

For fish:
```shell
echo &#039;mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Install the Python and Node toolchains using:

```shell
mise trust
mise install
```

### 4. Setup precommit hooks

Run `pnpm` in root directory to add pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;


### 3. Start Local Development
To compile and view changes made to `q chat`:
```shell
cargo run --bin chat_cli
```

&gt; If you are working on other q commands, just append `-- &lt;command name&gt;`. For example, to run `q login`, you can run `cargo run --bin chat_cli -- login`

To run tests for the Q CLI crate:
```shell
cargo test -p chat_cli
```

To format Rust files:
```shell
cargo +nightly fmt
```

To run clippy:
```shell
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --color always -- -D warnings
```



### 💡 Quick Tip for Onboarding

Use Q CLI to help you onboard Q CLI! 

Start a `q chat` session:

```shell
q chat
```

Once inside `q chat`, you can supply project context by adding the [`codebase-summary.md`](codebase-summary.md) file:

```shell
/context add codebase-summary.md
```

This enables Q to answer onboarding questions like:

- “What does this crate do?”

- “Where is X implemented?”

- “How do these components interact?”

Great for speeding up your ramp-up and navigating the repo more effectively.

# hyper-mcp

A fast, secure MCP server that extends its capabilities through WebAssembly plugins.

## What is it?

hyper-mcp makes it easy to add AI capabilities to your applications. It works with Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and other MCP-compatible apps. Write plugins in your favorite language, distribute them through container registries, and run them anywhere - from cloud to edge.

## Features

- Write plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly
- Distribute plugins via standard OCI registries (like Docker Hub)
- Built on [Extism](https://github.com/extism/extism) for rock-solid plugin support
- Lightweight enough for resource-constrained environments
- Support all 3 protocols in the spec: `stdio`, `sse` and `streamble-http`.
- Deploy anywhere: serverless, edge, mobile, IoT devices
- Cross-platform compatibility out of the box

## Security

Built with security-first mindset:

- Sandboxed plugins that can&#039;t access your system without permission
- Memory-safe execution with resource limits
- Secure plugin distribution through container registries
- Fine-grained access control for host functions
- OCI plugin images are signed at publish time and verified at load time with [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/).

## Getting Started

1. Create your config file:
   - Linux: `$HOME/.config/hyper-mcp/config.json`
   - Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}`. Eg: `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming`
   - macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/hyper-mcp/config.json`

```json
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;time&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/time-plugin:latest&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;qr-code&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/qrcode-plugin:latest&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;hash&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/hash-plugin:latest&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;myip&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/myip-plugin:latest&quot;,
      &quot;runtime_config&quot;: {
        &quot;allowed_hosts&quot;: [&quot;1.1.1.1&quot;]
      }
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;fetch&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/fetch-plugin:latest&quot;,
      &quot;runtime_config&quot;: {
        &quot;allowed_hosts&quot;: [&quot;*&quot;],
        &quot;memory_limit&quot;: &quot;100 MB&quot;
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Start the server:

```sh
$ hyper-mcp
```

- By default, it will use `stdio` transport. If you want to use SSE, use flag `--transport sse` or streamable HTTP with `--transport streamable-http`.
- If you want to debug, use `RUST_LOG=info`.
- If you&#039;re loading unsigned OCI plugin, you need to set `insecure_skip_signature` flag or env var `HYPER_MCP_INSECURE_SKIP_SIGNATURE` to `true`

## Using with Cursor IDE

You can configure hyper-mcp either globally for all projects or specifically for individual projects.

1. For project-scope configuration, create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;hyper-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/hyper-mcp&quot;
    }
  }
}
```

2. Set up hyper-mcp in Cursor&#039;s settings:
   ![cursor mcp](./assets/cursor-mcp.png)

3. Start using tools through chat:
   ![cursor mcp chat](./assets/cursor-mcp-1.png)

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Tested platforms

We test all combinations of:

| Instance       | Host OS &amp; Kernel | Guest Rootfs | Guest Kernel |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| c5n.metal      | al2 linux_5.10   | ubuntu 24.04 | linux_5.10   |

| m8g.metal-24xl |                  |              |              |
| m8g.metal-48xl |                  |              |              |

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

## Usage

Winit is a window creation and management library. It can create windows and lets you handle
events (for example: the window being resized, a key being pressed, a mouse movement, etc.)
produced by the window.

Winit is designed to be a low-level brick in a hierarchy of libraries. Consequently, in order to
show something on the window you need to use the platform-specific getters provided by winit, or
another library.

## CONTRIBUTING

For contributing guidelines see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## MSRV Policy

This crate&#039;s Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is **1.80**. Changes to
the MSRV will be accompanied by a minor version bump.

As a **tentative** policy, the upper bound of the MSRV is given by the following
formula:

```
min(sid, stable - 3)
```

Where `sid` is the current version of `rustc` provided by [Debian Sid], and
`stable` is the latest stable version of Rust. This bound may be broken in case of a major ecosystem shift or a security vulnerability.

[Debian Sid]: https://packages.debian.org/sid/rustc

An exception is made for the Android platform, where a higher Rust version
must be used for certain Android features. In this case, the MSRV will be
capped at the latest stable version of Rust minus three. This inconsistency is
not reflected in Cargo metadata, as it is not powerful enough to expose this
restriction.

Redox OS is also not covered by this MSRV policy, as it requires a Rust nightly
toolchain to compile.

All crates in the [`rust-windowing`] organizations have the
same MSRV policy.

[`rust-windowing`]: https://github.com/rust-windowing

Check out the [`winit::platform`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/platform/index.html) module for platform-specific usage.

### Repository License

Note that the license in `LICENSE` doesn&#039;t apply in full to the DPI package [./dpi](./dpi).
Full details can be found in that folder&#039;s README.
&lt;!-- This doesn&#039;t apply to users of the Winit crate, but this is also the repository level README --&gt;

# Rustlings 🦀❤️

&lt;/div&gt;

Greetings and welcome to Rustlings.
This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

It is recommended to do the Rustlings exercises in parallel to reading [the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust 📚️

[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) is another recommended resource that you might find helpful.
It contains code examples and exercises similar to Rustlings, but online.

## Getting Started

### Installing Rust

Before installing Rustlings, you need to have the **latest version of Rust** installed.
Visit [www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for further instructions on installing Rust.
This will also install _Cargo_, Rust&#039;s package/project manager.

&gt; 🐧 If you are on Linux, make sure you have installed `gcc` (for a linker).
&gt;
&gt; Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`
&gt;
&gt; Dnf: `sudo dnf install gcc`

&gt; 🍎 If you are on MacOS, make sure you have installed Xcode and its developer tools by running `xcode-select --install`.

### Installing Rustlings

The following command will download and compile Rustlings:

```bash
cargo install rustlings
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the installation fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

- Make sure you have the latest Rust version by running `rustup update`
- Try adding the `--locked` flag: `cargo install rustlings --locked`
- Otherwise, please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new)

&lt;/details&gt;

### Initialization

After installing Rustlings, run the following command to initialize the `rustlings/` directory:

```bash
rustlings init
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the command &lt;code&gt;rustlings&lt;/code&gt; can&#039;t be found…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

You are probably using Linux and installed Rust using your package manager.

Cargo installs binaries to the directory `~/.cargo/bin`.
Sadly, package managers often don&#039;t add `~/.cargo/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.

The solution is to …

- either add `~/.cargo/bin` manually to `PATH`
- or to uninstall Rust from the package manager and install it using the official way with `rustup`: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

&lt;/details&gt;

Now, go into the newly initialized directory and launch Rustlings for further instructions on getting started with the exercises:

```bash
cd rustlings/
rustlings
```

## Working environment

### Editor

Our general recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [rust-analyzer plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
But any editor that supports [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) should be enough for working on the exercises.

### Terminal

While working with Rustlings, please use a modern terminal for the best user experience.
The default terminal on Linux and Mac should be sufficient.
On Windows, we recommend the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal).

## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `exercises/&lt;topic&gt;`.
For every topic, there is an additional `README.md` file with some resources to get you started on the topic.
We highly recommend that you have a look at them before you start 📚️

Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and it&#039;s up to you to fix it!
Some exercises contain tests that need to pass for the exercise to be done ✅

Search for `TODO` and `todo!()` to find out what you need to change.
Ask for hints by entering `h` in the _watch mode_ 💡

### Watch Mode

After the [initialization](#initialization), Rustlings can be launched by simply running the command `rustlings`.

This will start the _watch mode_ which walks you through the exercises in a predefined order (what we think is best for newcomers).
It will rerun the current exercise automatically every time you change the exercise&#039;s file in the `exercises/` directory.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If detecting file changes in the &lt;code&gt;exercises/&lt;/code&gt; directory fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

&gt; You can add the **`--manual-run`** flag (`rustlings --manual-run`) to manually rerun the current exercise by entering `r` in the watch mode.
&gt;
&gt; Please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new) with some information about your operating system and whether you run Rustlings in a container or virtual machine (e.g. WSL).

&lt;/details&gt;

### Exercise List

In the [watch mode](#watch-mode) (after launching `rustlings`), you can enter `l` to open the interactive exercise list.

The list allows you to…

- See the status of all exercises (done or pending)
- `c`: Continue at another exercise (temporarily skip some exercises or go back to a previous one)
- `r`: Reset status and file of the selected exercise (you need to _reload/reopen_ its file in your editor afterwards)

See the footer of the list for all possible keys.

## Questions?

If you need any help while doing the exercises and the builtin-hints aren&#039;t helpful, feel free to ask in the [_Q&amp;A_ category of the discussions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=) if your question wasn&#039;t asked yet 💡

## Third-Party Exercises

Third-party exercises are a set of exercises maintained by the community.
You can use the same `rustlings` program that you installed with `cargo install rustlings` to run them:

- 🇯🇵 [Japanese Rustlings](https://github.com/sotanengel/rustlings-jp)：A Japanese translation of the Rustlings exercises.
- 🇨🇳 [Simplified Chinese Rustlings](https://github.com/SandmeyerX/rustlings-zh-cn): A simplified Chinese translation of the Rustlings exercises.

Do you want to create your own set of Rustlings exercises to focus on some specific topic?
Or do you want to translate the original Rustlings exercises?
Then follow the the guide about [third-party exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_EXERCISES.md)!

## Continuing On

Once you&#039;ve completed Rustlings, put your new knowledge to good use!
Continue practicing your Rust skills by building your own projects, contributing to Rustlings, or finding other open-source projects to contribute to.

## Uninstalling Rustlings

If you want to remove Rustlings from your system, run the following command:

```bash
cargo uninstall rustlings
```

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;✨🎉👉 &lt;a href=&quot;https://epi052.github.io/feroxbuster-docs/docs/&quot;&gt;NEW DOCUMENTATION SITE&lt;/a&gt; 👈🎉✨&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;


## 🚀 Documentation has **moved** 🚀  

Instead of having a 1300 line `README.md` (sorry...), feroxbuster&#039;s documentation has moved to GitHub Pages. The move to hosting documentation on Pages should make it a LOT easier to find the information you&#039;re looking for, whatever that may be. Please check it out for anything you need beyond a quick-start. The new documentation can be found [here](https://epi052.github.io/feroxbuster-docs/docs/). 

## 😕 What the heck is a ferox anyway?

Ferox is short for Ferric Oxide. Ferric Oxide, simply put, is rust. The name rustbuster was taken, so I decided on a
variation. 🤷

## 🤔 What&#039;s it do tho?

`feroxbuster` is a tool designed to perform [Forced Browsing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Forced_browsing).

Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access resources that are not referenced by the web
application, but are still accessible by an attacker.

`feroxbuster` uses brute force combined with a wordlist to search for unlinked content in target directories. These
resources may store sensitive information about web applications and operational systems, such as source code,
credentials, internal network addressing, etc...

This attack is also known as Predictable Resource Location, File Enumeration, Directory Enumeration, and Resource
Enumeration.

## ⏳ Quick Start

This section will cover the minimum amount of information to get up and running with feroxbuster. Please refer the the [documentation](https://epi052.github.io/feroxbuster-docs/docs/), as it&#039;s much more comprehensive.

### 💿 Installation

There are quite a few other [installation methods](https://epi052.github.io/feroxbuster-docs/docs/installation/), but these snippets should cover the majority of users. 

#### Kali 

If you&#039;re using kali, this is the preferred install method. Installing from the repos adds a [**ferox-config.toml**](https://epi052.github.io/feroxbuster-docs/docs/configuration/ferox-config-toml/) in `/etc/feroxbuster/`, adds command completion for bash, fish, and zsh, includes a man page entry, and installs `feroxbuster` itself. 

```
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -y feroxbuster
```

#### Linux (32 and 64-bit) &amp; MacOS

Install to a particular directory
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epi052/feroxbuster/main/install-nix.sh | bash -s $HOME/.local/bin
```

Install to current working directory
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epi052/feroxbuster/main/install-nix.sh | bash
```

#### MacOS via Homebrew 

```
brew install feroxbuster
```

#### Windows x86_64

```
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases/latest/download/x86_64-windows-feroxbuster.exe.zip -OutFile feroxbuster.zip
Expand-Archive .\feroxbuster.zip
.\feroxbuster\feroxbuster.exe -V
```

#### Windows via Winget

```
winget install epi052.feroxbuster
```

#### Windows via Chocolatey

```
choco install feroxbuster
```

#### All others 

Please refer the the [documentation](https://epi052.github.io/feroxbuster-docs/docs/).

### Updating feroxbuster (new in v2.9.1)

```
./feroxbuster --update
```

## 🧰 Example Usage

Here are a few brief examples to get you started.  Please note, feroxbuster can do a **lot more** than what&#039;s listed below.  As a result, there are **many more** examples, with **demonstration gifs** that highlight specific features, in the [documentation](https://epi052.github.io/feroxbuster-docs/docs/).

### Multiple Values

Options that take multiple values are very flexible. Consider the following ways of specifying extensions:

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 -x pdf -x js,html -x php txt json,docx
```

The command above adds .pdf, .js, .html, .php, .txt, .json, and .docx to each url

All of the methods above (multiple flags, space separated, comma separated, etc...) are valid and interchangeable. The
same goes for urls, headers, status codes, queries, and size filters.

### Include Headers

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 -H Accept:application/json &quot;Authorization: Bearer {token}&quot;
```

### IPv6, non-recursive scan with INFO-level logging enabled

```
./feroxbuster -u http://[::1] --no-recursion -vv
```

### Read urls from STDIN; pipe only resulting urls out to another tool

```
cat targets | ./feroxbuster --stdin --silent -s 200 301 302 --redirects -x js | fff -s 200 -o js-files
```

### Proxy traffic through Burp

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --insecure --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Proxy traffic through a SOCKS proxy (including DNS lookups)

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050
```

### Pass auth token via query parameter

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --query token=0123456789ABCDEF
```



## 🚀 Documentation has **moved** 🚀

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in `ci/rust-version.sh` and if necessary, install that version by running:

```bash
$ rustup install VERSION
```

Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an [override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in order to use the correct version.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

On Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo test
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

- `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it&#039;s a _solution_ to
some problem. Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of _problems_ the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn&#039;t _infringe_ on anyone else&#039;s solutions. Adding a
test _protects_ your solution from future changes. Say you don&#039;t understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, &quot;what
problem is solved by this code?&quot; On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it&#039;s protecting, please
send us that patch!

Pronounced **_/u:ˈtoʊ:i.pɑ/_** or **_/u:ˈtoʊˌaɪ.piˈeɪ/_** whatever works better for you.

Want to have your API documented with OpenAPI? But don&#039;t want to be bothered
with manual YAML or JSON tweaking? Would like it to be so easy that it would almost
be utopic? Don&#039;t worry: utoipa is here to fill this gap. It aims to do, if not all, then
most of the heavy lifting for you, enabling you to focus on writing the actual API logic instead of
documentation. It aims to be _minimal_, _simple_ and _fast_. It uses simple `proc` macros which
you can use to annotate your code to have items documented.

The `utoipa` crate provides auto-generated OpenAPI documentation for Rust REST APIs. It treats
code-first approach as a first class citizen and simplifies API documentation by providing
simple macros for generating the documentation from your code.

It also contains Rust types of the OpenAPI spec, allowing you to write the OpenAPI spec only using
Rust if auto generation is not your flavor or does not fit your purpose.

Long term goal of the library is to be the place to go when OpenAPI documentation is needed in any Rust
codebase.

Utoipa is framework-agnostic, and could be used together with any web framework, or even without one. While
being portable and standalone, one of its key aspects is simple integration with web frameworks.

## Choose your flavor and document your API with ice-cold IPA

|Flavor|Support|
|--|--|
|[actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web)|Parse path, path parameters and query parameters, recognize request body and response body, [`utoipa-actix-web` bindings](./utoipa-actix-web/README.md). See more at [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#actix_extras-feature-support-for-actix-web)|
|[axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)|Parse path and query parameters, recognize request body and response body, [`utoipa-axum` bindings](./utoipa-axum/README.md). See more at [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#axum_extras-feature-support-for-axum)|
|[rocket](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket)| Parse path, path parameters and query parameters, recognize request body and response body. See more at [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#rocket_extras-feature-support-for-rocket)|
|Others*| Plain `utoipa` without extra flavor. This gives you all the basic benefits listed below in **[Features](#features)** section but with little less automation.|

&gt; Others* = For example [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) but could be anything.

Refer to the existing [examples](./examples) to find out more.

## Features

* OpenAPI 3.1
* Pluggable, easy setup and integration with frameworks. 
* No bloat, enable what you need.
* Support for generic types
  * **Note!**&lt;br&gt;
    Tuples, arrays and slices cannot be used as generic arguments on types. Types implementing `ToSchema` manually should not have generic arguments, as
    they are not composeable and will result compile error.
* Automatic schema collection from usages recursively. 
  * Request body from either handler function arguments (if supported by framework) or from `request_body` attribute.
  * Response body from response `body` attribute or response `content` attribute.
* Various OpenAPI visualization tools supported out of the box.
* Rust type aliases via [`utoipa-config`](./utoipa-config/README.md).

## What&#039;s up with the word play?

The name comes from the words `utopic` and `api` where `uto` are the first three letters of _utopic_
and the `ipa` is _api_ reversed. Aaand... `ipa` is also an awesome type of beer :beer:.

## Crate Features

- **`macros`** Enable `utoipa-gen` macros. **This is enabled by default.**
- **`yaml`**: Enables **serde_norway** serialization of OpenAPI objects.
- **`actix_extras`**: Enhances [actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web/) integration with being able to
  parse `path`, `path` and `query` parameters from actix web path attribute macros. See
  [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#actix_extras-feature-support-for-actix-web) or [examples](./examples) for more details.
- **`rocket_extras`**: Enhances [rocket](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket) framework integration with being
  able to parse `path`, `path` and `query` parameters from rocket path attribute macros. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#rocket_extras-feature-support-for-rocket)
  or [examples](./examples) for more details.
- **`axum_extras`**: Enhances [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework integration allowing users to use `IntoParams` without
  defining the `parameter_in` attribute. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html#axum_extras-feature-support-for-axum)
  or [examples](./examples) for more details.
- **`debug`**: Add extra traits such as debug traits to openapi definitions and elsewhere.
- **`chrono`**: Add support for [chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) `DateTime`, `Date`, `NaiveDate`, `NaiveDateTime`, `NaiveTime` and `Duration`
  types. By default these types are parsed to `string` types with additional `format` information.
  `format: date-time` for `DateTime` and `NaiveDateTime` and `format: date` for `Date` and `NaiveDate` according
  [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6) as `ISO-8601`. To
  override default `string` representation users have to use `value_type` attribute to override the type.
  See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html) for more details.
- **`time`**: Add support for [time](https://crates.io/crates/time) `OffsetDateTime`, `PrimitiveDateTime`, `Date`, and `Duration` types.
  By default these types are parsed as `string`. `OffsetDateTime` and `PrimitiveDateTime` will use `date-time` format. `Date` will use
  `date` format and `Duration` will not have any format. To override default `string` representation users have to use `value_type` attribute
  to override the type. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html) for more details.
- **`jiff_0_2`** Add support for [jiff 0.2](https://crates.io/crates/jiff) `Zoned`, and `civil::Date` types.
  By default these types are parsed as `string`. `Zoned` will use `date-time` format. `civil::Date` will use
  `date` format. To override default `string` representation users have to use `value_type` attribute
  to override the type. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html) for more details.
- **`decimal`**: Add support for [rust_decimal](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal) `Decimal` type. **By default**
  it is interpreted as `String`. If you wish to change the format you need to override the type.
  See the `value_type` in [component derive docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html).
- **`decimal_float`**: Add support for [rust_decimal](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal) `Decimal` type. **By default**
  it is interpreted as `Number`. This feature is mutually exclusive with **decimal** and allow to change the default type used in your
  documentation for `Decimal` much like `serde_with_float` feature exposed by rust_decimal.
- **`uuid`**: Add support for [uuid](https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid). `Uuid` type will be presented as `String` with
  format `uuid` in OpenAPI spec.
- **`ulid`**: Add support for [ulid](https://github.com/dylanhart/ulid-rs). `Ulid` type will be presented as `String` with
  format `ulid` in OpenAPI spec.
- **`url`**: Add support for [url](https://github.com/servo/rust-url). `Url` type will be presented as `String` with
  format `uri` in OpenAPI spec.
- **`smallvec`**: Add support for [smallvec](https://crates.io/crates/smallvec). `SmallVec` will be treated as `Vec`.
- **`openapi_extensions`**: Adds traits and functions that provide extra convenience functions.
  See the [`request_body` docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/openapi/request_body) for an example.
- **`repr`**: Add support for [repr_serde](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-repr)&#039;s `repr(u*)` and `repr(i*)` attributes to unit type enums for
  C-like enum representation. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html) for more details.
- **`preserve_order`**: Preserve order of properties when serializing the schema for a component.
  When enabled, the properties are listed in order of fields in the corresponding struct definition.
  When disabled, the properties are listed in alphabetical order.
- **`preserve_path_order`**: Preserve order of OpenAPI Paths according to order they have been
  introduced to the `#[openapi(paths(...))]` macro attribute. If disabled the paths will be
  ordered in alphabetical order. **However** the operations order under the path **will** be always constant according to [specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#fixed-fields-6)
- **`indexmap`**: Add support for [indexmap](https://crates.io/crates/indexmap). When enabled `IndexMap` will be rendered as a map similar to
  `BTreeMap` and `HashMap`.
- **`non_strict_integers`**: Add support for non-standard integer formats `int8`, `int16`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, and `uint64`.
- **`rc_schema`**: Add `ToSchema` support for `Arc&lt;T&gt;` and `Rc&lt;T&gt;` types. **Note!** serde `rc` feature flag must be enabled separately to allow
  serialization and deserialization of `Arc&lt;T&gt;` and `Rc&lt;T&gt;` types. See more about [serde feature flags](https://serde.rs/feature-flags.html).
- **`config`** Enables [`utoipa-config`](./utoipa-config/README.md) for the project which allows defining global configuration options for `utoipa`.

### Default Library Support

* Implicit partial support for `serde` attributes. See [docs](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.ToSchema.html#partial-serde-attributes-support) for more details.
* Support for [http](https://crates.io/crates/http) `StatusCode` in responses.

## Install

Add dependency declaration to `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
utoipa = &quot;5&quot;
```

## Examples

_Create type with `ToSchema` and use it in `#[utoipa::path(...)]` that is registered to the `OpenApi`._

```rust
use utoipa::{OpenApi, ToSchema};

#[derive(ToSchema)]
struct Pet {
   id: u64,
   name: String,
   age: Option&lt;i32&gt;,
}

mod pet_api {
    /// Get pet by id
    ///
    /// Get pet from database by pet id
    #[utoipa::path(
        get,
        path = &quot;/pets/{id}&quot;,
        responses(
            (status = 200, description = &quot;Pet found successfully&quot;, body = Pet),
            (status = NOT_FOUND, description = &quot;Pet was not found&quot;)
        ),
        params(
            (&quot;id&quot; = u64, Path, description = &quot;Pet database id to get Pet for&quot;),
        )
    )]
    async fn get_pet_by_id(pet_id: u64) -&gt; Result&lt;Pet, NotFound&gt; {
        Ok(Pet {
            id: pet_id,
            age: None,
            name: &quot;lightning&quot;.to_string(),
        })
    }
}

#[derive(OpenApi)]
#[openapi(paths(pet_api::get_pet_by_id))]
struct ApiDoc;

println!(&quot;{}&quot;, ApiDoc::openapi().to_pretty_json().unwrap());
```

&lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Above example will produce an OpenAPI doc like this:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```json

    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Modify OpenAPI at runtime

You can modify generated OpenAPI at runtime either via generated types directly or using
[Modify](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/trait.Modify.html) trait.

_Modify generated OpenAPI via types directly._

```rust
#[derive(OpenApi)]
#[openapi(
    info(description = &quot;My Api description&quot;),
)]
struct ApiDoc;

let mut doc = ApiDoc::openapi();
doc.info.title = String::from(&quot;My Api&quot;);
```

_You can even convert the generated [OpenApi](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/openapi/struct.OpenApi.html) to [OpenApiBuilder](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/openapi/struct.OpenApiBuilder.html)._

```rust
let builder: OpenApiBuilder = ApiDoc::openapi().into();
```

See [Modify](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/trait.Modify.html) trait for examples on how to modify generated OpenAPI via it.

## FAQ

### Swagger UI returns 404 NotFound from built binary

This is highly probably due to `RustEmbed` not embedding the Swagger UI to the executable. This is natural since the `RustEmbed`
library **does not** by default embed files on debug builds. To get around this you can do one of the following.

1. Build your executable in `--release` mode
2. or add `debug-embed` feature flag to your `Cargo.toml` for `utoipa-swagger-ui`. This will enable the `debug-emebed` feature flag for
   `RustEmbed` as well. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/issues/527#issuecomment-1474219098) and [here](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/issues/268).

Find `utoipa-swagger-ui` [feature flags here](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/tree/master/utoipa-swagger-ui#crate-features).

### How to implement `ToSchema` for external type?

There are few ways around this that are elaborated [here in detail](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/issues/790#issuecomment-1787754185).

### Auto discover for OpenAPI schemas and paths?

Currently there is no build in solution to automatically discover the OpenAPI types but for your luck there is a pretty neat crate that 
just does this for you called [utoipauto](https://github.com/ProbablyClem/utoipauto).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mullvad VPN desktop and mobile app

Welcome to the Mullvad VPN client app source code repository.
This is the VPN client software for the Mullvad VPN service.
For more information about the service, please visit our website,
[mullvad.net](https://mullvad.net) (Also accessible via Tor on our
[onion service](http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/)).

This repository contains all the source code for the
desktop and mobile versions of the app. For desktop this includes the system service/daemon
([`mullvad-daemon`](mullvad-daemon/)), a graphical user interface ([GUI](desktop/)) and a command
line interface ([CLI](mullvad-cli/)). The Android app uses the same backing system service for the
tunnel and security but has a dedicated frontend in [android/](android/). iOS consists of a
completely standalone implementation that resides in [ios/](ios/).

## Releases

There are built and signed releases for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android available on
[our website](https://mullvad.net/download/) and on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases/). The Android app is also available
on [Google Play] and [F-Droid] and the iOS version on [App Store].

[Google Play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mullvad.mullvadvpn
[F-Droid]: https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn/
[App Store]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mullvad-vpn/id1488466513

You can find our code signing keys as well as instructions for how to cryptographically verify
your download on [Mullvad&#039;s Open Source page].

### Platform/OS support

These are the operating systems and their versions that the app officially supports. It might
work on many more versions, but we don&#039;t test for those and can&#039;t guarantee the quality or
security.

| OS/Platform | Supported versions |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Windows     | 10 and 11          |
| macOS       | The three latest major releases |
| Linux (Ubuntu)| The two latest LTS releases and the latest non-LTS releases |
| Linux (Fedora) | The versions that are not yet [EOL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life) |
| Linux (Debian) | 12 and newer    |
| Android     | 8 and newer        |
| iOS         | 15.0 and newer     |

On Linux we test using the Gnome desktop environment. The app should, and probably does work
in other DEs, but we don&#039;t regularly test those.

## Features

Here is a table containing the features of the app across platforms. This is intended to reflect
the current state of the latest code in git, not necessarily any existing release.

## Security and anonymity

This app is a privacy preserving VPN client. As such it goes to great lengths to stop traffic
leaks. And basically all settings default to the more secure/private option. The user has to
explicitly allow more loose rules if desired. See the [dedicated security document] for details
on what the app blocks and allows, as well as how it does it.

[dedicated security document]: docs/security.md

## Checking out the code

This repository contains submodules needed for building the app. However, some of those submodules
also have further submodules that are quite large and not needed to build the app. So unless
you want the source code for OpenSSL, OpenVPN and a few other projects you should avoid a recursive
clone of the repository. Instead clone the repository normally and then get one level of submodules:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app.git
cd mullvadvpn-app
git submodule update --init
```

On Android, Windows, Linux and macOS you also want to checkout the wireguard-go submodule:
```bash
git submodule update --init wireguard-go-rs/libwg/wireguard-go
```
Further details on why this is necessary can be found in the [wireguard-go-rs crate](./wireguard-go-rs/README.md).

We sign every commit on the `main` branch as well as our release tags. If you would like to verify
your checkout, you can find our developer keys on [Mullvad&#039;s Open Source page].

### Binaries submodule

This repository has a git submodule at `dist-assets/binaries`. This submodule contains binaries and
build scripts for third party code we need to bundle with the app. Such as OpenVPN, Wintun
etc.

This submodule conforms to the same integrity/security standards as this repository. Every merge
commit should be signed. And this main repository should only ever point to a signed merge commit
of the binaries submodule.

See the [binaries submodule&#039;s](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app-binaries) README for more
details about that repository.

## Building the app

See the [build instructions](BuildInstructions.md) for help building the app on desktop platforms.

For building the Android app, see the [instructions](./android/BuildInstructions.md) for Android.

For building the iOS app, see the [instructions](./ios/BuildInstructions.md) for iOS.

## Releasing the app

See [this](Release.md) for instructions on how to make a new release.

## Environment variables used by the service

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DEBUG` - Helps debugging the firewall. Does different things depending on
  platform:
  * Linux: Set to `&quot;1&quot;` to add packet counters to all firewall rules.
  * macOS: Makes rules log the packets they match to the `pflog0` interface.
    * Set to `&quot;all&quot;` to add logging to all rules.
    * Set to `&quot;pass&quot;` to add logging to rules allowing packets.
    * Set to `&quot;drop&quot;` to add logging to rules blocking packets.

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_SRC_VALID_MARK` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from
    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark` kernel parameter to `1` on Linux when a tunnel
    is established.
    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise strict reverse path filtering
    may prevent relay traffic from reaching the daemon. If `rp_filter` is set to `1` on the interface
    that will be receiving relay traffic, and `src_valid_mark` is not set to `1`, the daemon will
    not be able to receive relay traffic.

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_ARP_IGNORE` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from
    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` kernel parameter to `2` on Linux when a tunnel
    is established.
    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise an attacker who can send ARP
    requests to the device running Mullvad can figure out the in-tunnel IP.

* `TALPID_DNS_MODULE` - Allows changing the method that will be used for DNS configuration.
  By default this is automatically detected, but you can set it to one of the options below to
  choose a specific method.

  * Linux
    * `&quot;static-file&quot;`: change the `/etc/resolv.conf` file directly
    * `&quot;resolvconf&quot;`: use the `resolvconf` program
    * `&quot;systemd&quot;`: use systemd&#039;s `resolved` service through DBus
    * `&quot;network-manager&quot;`: use `NetworkManager` service through DBus

  * Windows
    * `iphlpapi`: use the IP helper API
    * `netsh`: use the `netsh` program
    * `tcpip`: set TCP/IP parameters in the registry

- `TALPID_DISABLE_LOCAL_DNS_RESOLVER` - Set this variable to `1` to disable the local DNS resolver (macOS only).

* `TALPID_FORCE_USERSPACE_WIREGUARD` - Forces the daemon to use the userspace implementation of
   WireGuard on Linux.

* `TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR` - Forces the daemon to always assume the host is online.

* `TALPID_NET_CLS_MOUNT_DIR` - On Linux, forces the daemon to mount the `net_cls` controller in the
  specified directory if it isn&#039;t mounted already.

* `MULLVAD_MANAGEMENT_SOCKET_GROUP` - On Linux and macOS, this restricts access to the management
  interface UDS socket to users in the specified group. This means that only users in that group can
  use the CLI and GUI. By default, everyone has access to the socket.

* `MULLVAD_BACKTRACE_ON_FAULT` - When enabled, if the daemon encounters a fault (e.g. `SIGSEGV`),
  it will log a backtrace to stdout, and to `daemon.log`. By default, this is disabled in
  release-builds and enabled in debug-builds. Set variable to `1` or `0` to explicitly enable or
  disable this feature. Logging the backtrace cause heap allocation. Allocation is not signal safe,
  but here it runs in the signal handler. This in technically undefined behavior and therefore
  disabled by default. This usually works, but enable at your own risk.

### Development builds only

* `MULLVAD_API_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in API requests. E.g. `api.mullvad.net`.

* `MULLVAD_API_ADDR` - Set the IP address and port to use in API requests. E.g. `10.10.1.2:443`.

* `MULLVAD_API_DISABLE_TLS` - Use plain HTTP for API requests.

* `MULLVAD_CONNCHECK_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in connection check requests. E.g. `am.i.mullvad.net`.

### Setting environment variables

#### Windows

Use `setx` from an elevated shell:

```bat
setx TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE 1 /m
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bat
sc.exe stop mullvadvpn
sc.exe start mullvadvpn
```

#### Linux

Edit the systemd unit file via `systemctl edit mullvad-daemon.service`:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=&quot;TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR=1&quot;
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mullvad-daemon
```

#### macOS

Use `plutil`:

```bash
sudo plutil -replace EnvironmentVariables -json &#039;{&quot;TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR&quot;: &quot;1&quot;}&#039; /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bash
launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
```

## Environment variables used by the desktop frontend

* `MULLVAD_PATH` - Allows changing the path to the folder with the `mullvad-problem-report` tool
   when running in development mode. Defaults to: `&lt;repo&gt;/target/debug/`.
* `MULLVAD_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION` - If set to `1`, notification will be disabled when
   an update is available.


## Command line tools for Electron app development

- `$ npm run develop` - develop app with live-reload enabled
- `$ npm run lint` - lint code
- `$ npm run pack:&lt;OS&gt;` - prepare app for distribution for your platform. Where `&lt;OS&gt;` can be
  `linux`, `mac` or `win`
- `$ npm test` - run tests


## Tray icon on Linux

The requirements for displaying a tray icon varies between different desktop environments. If the
tray icon doesn&#039;t appear, try installing one of these packages:
- `libappindicator3-1`
- `libappindicator1`
- `libappindicator`

If you&#039;re using GNOME, try installing one of these GNOME Shell extensions:
- `TopIconsFix`
- `TopIcons Plus`

### Mullvad Daemon

The daemon is implemented in Rust and is implemented in several crates. The main, or top level,
crate that builds the final daemon binary is `mullvad-daemon` which then depend on the others.

In general one can look at the daemon as split into two parts, the crates starting with `talpid`
and the crates starting with `mullvad`. The `talpid` crates are supposed to be completely unrelated
to Mullvad specific things. A `talpid` crate is not allowed to know anything about the API through
which the daemon fetch Mullvad account details or download VPN server lists for example. The
`talpid` components should be viewed as a generic VPN client with extra privacy and anonymity
preserving features. The crates having `mullvad` in their name on the other hand make use of the
`talpid` components to build a secure and Mullvad specific VPN client.


- **Cargo.toml** - Main Rust workspace definition. See this file for which folders here are daemon
  Rust crates.
- **mullvad-daemon/** - Main Rust crate building the daemon binary.
- **talpid-core/** - Main crate of the VPN client implementation itself. Completely Mullvad agnostic
  privacy preserving VPN client library.

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT3` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

**Burn is a next generation Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on &lt;br /&gt;
flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

## Performance

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-blazingly-fast.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Because we believe the goal of a deep learning framework is to convert computation into useful
intelligence, we have made performance a core pillar of Burn. We strive to achieve top efficiency by
leveraging multiple optimization techniques described below.

**Click on each section for more details** 👇

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel fusion 💥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Using Burn means having your models optimized on any backend. When possible, we provide a way to
automatically and dynamically create custom kernels that minimize data relocation between different
memory spaces, extremely useful when moving memory is the bottleneck.

As an example, you could write your own GELU activation function with the high level tensor api (see
Rust code snippet below).

```rust
fn gelu_custom&lt;B: Backend, const D: usize&gt;(x: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
    let x = x.clone() * ((x / SQRT_2).erf() + 1);
    x / 2
}
```

Then, at runtime, a custom low-level kernel will be automatically created for your specific
implementation and will rival a handcrafted GPU implementation. The kernel consists of about 60
lines of WGSL [WebGPU Shading Language](&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/&quot;),
an extremely verbose lower level shader language you probably don&#039;t want to program your deep
learning models in!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Asynchronous execution ❤️‍🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

For [first-party backends](#backends), an asynchronous execution style
is used, which allows to perform various optimizations, such as the previously mentioned automatic
kernel fusion.

Asynchronous execution also ensures that the normal execution of the framework does not block the
model computations, which implies that the framework overhead won&#039;t impact the speed of execution
significantly. Conversely, the intense computations in the model do not interfere with the
responsiveness of the framework. For more information about our asynchronous backends, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Thread-safe building blocks 🦞
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn emphasizes thread safety by leveraging the
[ownership system of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
With Burn, each module is the owner of its weights. It is therefore possible to send a module to
another thread for computing the gradients, then send the gradients to the main thread that can
aggregate them, and _voilà_, you get multi-device training.

This is a very different approach from what PyTorch does, where backpropagation actually mutates the
_grad_ attribute of each tensor parameter. This is not a thread-safe operation and therefore
requires lower level synchronization primitives, see
[distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) for reference. Note that
this is still very fast, but not compatible across different backends and quite hard to implement.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Intelligent memory management 🦀
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

One of the main roles of a deep learning framework is to reduce the amount of memory necessary to
run models. The naive way of handling memory is that each tensor has its own memory space, which is
allocated when the tensor is created then deallocated as the tensor gets out of scope. However,
allocating and deallocating data is very costly, so a memory pool is often required to achieve good
throughput. Burn offers an infrastructure that allows for easily creating and selecting memory
management strategies for backends. For more details on memory management in Burn, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

Another very important memory optimization of Burn is that we keep track of when a tensor can be
mutated in-place just by using the ownership system well. Even though it is a rather small memory
optimization on its own, it adds up considerably when training or running inference with larger
models and contributes to reduce the memory usage even more. For more information, see
[this blog post about tensor handling](https://burn.dev/blog/burn-rusty-approach-to-tensor-handling).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel selection 🎯
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A good deep learning framework should ensure that models run smoothly on all hardware. However, not
all hardware share the same behavior in terms of execution speed. For instance, a matrix
multiplication kernel can be launched with many different parameters, which are highly sensitive to
the size of the matrices and the hardware. Using the wrong configuration could reduce the speed of
execution by a large factor (10 times or even more in extreme cases), so choosing the right kernels
becomes a priority.

With our home-made backends, we run benchmarks automatically and choose the best configuration for
the current hardware and matrix sizes with a reasonable caching strategy.

This adds a small overhead by increasing the warmup execution time, but stabilizes quickly after a
few forward and backward passes, saving lots of time in the long run. Note that this feature isn&#039;t
mandatory, and can be disabled when cold starts are a priority over optimized throughput.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Hardware specific features 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is no secret that deep learning is mostly relying on matrix multiplication as its core operation,
since this is how fully-connected neural networks are modeled.

More and more, hardware manufacturers optimize their chips specifically for matrix multiplication
workloads. For instance, Nvidia has its _Tensor Cores_ and today most cellphones have AI specialized
chips. As of this moment, we support Tensor Cores with our LibTorch, Candle, CUDA, Metal and WGPU/SPIR-V
backends, but not other accelerators yet. We hope
[this issue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4195) gets resolved at some point to bring
support to our WGPU backend.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Custom Backend Extension 🎒
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn aims to be the most flexible deep learning framework. While it&#039;s crucial to maintain
compatibility with a wide variety of backends, Burn also provides the ability to extend the
functionalities of a backend implementation to suit your personal modeling requirements.

This versatility is advantageous in numerous ways, such as supporting custom operations like flash
attention or manually writing your own kernel for a specific backend to enhance performance. See
[this section](https://burn.dev/burn-book/advanced/backend-extension/index.html) in the Burn Book 🔥
for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust implementations.
We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your models in the cloud,
then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend 🔄
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
For now, only the WGPU and CUDA backends have support for fused kernels.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Fusion, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Fusion&lt;Wgpu&gt;&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}

```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server.
The client sends tensor operations over the network to a remote compute backend.
You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand 👇**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard 📈
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption 🛡

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support 🐫
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-standard format that exports both the architecture
and the weights of a deep learning model.

Burn supports the importation of models that follow the ONNX standard so you can easily port a model
you have written in another framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn to benefit from all the
advantages our framework offers.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch or Safetensors Models 🚚
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You can load weights from PyTorch or Safetensors formats directly into your Burn-defined models. This makes it easy to reuse existing models while benefiting from Burn&#039;s performance and deployment features.

Learn more:

- [Import pre-trained PyTorch models into Burn](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/pytorch-model.html)
- [Load models from Safetensors format](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/safetensors-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser 🌐
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can compile to Web Assembly: Candle and NdArray for CPU, and WGPU for GPU.
This means that you can run inference directly within a browser. We provide several examples of
this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2️⃣ 7️⃣ 😰
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! 🌄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ⚙️
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).

&gt; ⚠️ **Warning**
&gt; When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency chain.
&gt; To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file:
&gt;
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.

## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/burn-book/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests 😄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples 🙏
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Workspaces) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Window-Rules#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Screencasting#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Tabs)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Layout#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: no built-in support, but xwayland-satellite is [easy to set up](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-xwayland-satellite) and works very well.
    - Steam and games, including Proton: work perfectly through xwayland-satellite.
    - JetBrains IDEs, Ghidra: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Discord and other Electron apps: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Chromium and VSCode: work perfectly natively on Wayland with the right flags.
    - X11 apps that want to position windows or bars at specific screen coordinates: won&#039;t work well; you can run them in a nested compositor like [labwc](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-the-labwc-wayland-compositor) or [rootful Xwayland](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#directly-running-xwayland-in-rootful-mode).
    - Display scaling (integer or fractional) keeps X11 apps crisp, but you need the latest xwayland-satellite.
    For games, you can run them in [gamescope] at native resolution, even with display scaling.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

## What&#039;s NativeLink?

NativeLink is an efficient, high-performance build cache and remote execution system that accelerates software compilation and testing while reducing infrastructure costs. It optimizes build processes for projects of all sizes by intelligently caching build artifacts and distributing tasks across multiple machines.

NativeLink is trusted in production environments to reduce costs and developer iteration times--handling over **one billion requests** per month for its customers, including large corporations such as **Samsung**.

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## 🔑 Key Features

1. **Advanced Build Cache**:
   - Stores and reuses results of previous build steps for unchanged components
   - Significantly reduces build times, especially for incremental changes

2. **Efficient Remote Execution**:
   - Distributes build and test tasks across a network of machines
   - Parallelizes workloads for faster completion
   - Utilizes remote resources to offload computational burden from local machines
   - Ensures consistency with a uniform, controlled build environment

NativeLink seamlessly integrates with build tools that use the Remote Execution protocol, such as [Bazel](https://bazel.build), [Buck2](https://buck2.build), [Goma](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/), and [Reclient](https://github.com/bazelbuild/reclient). It supports Unix-based operating systems and Windows, ensuring broad compatibility across different development environments.

## 🚀 Quickstart

To start, you can deploy NativeLink as a Docker image (as shown below) or by using our cloud-hosted solution, [NativeLink Cloud](https://app.nativelink.com). It&#039;s **FREE** for individuals, open-source projects, and cloud production environments, with support for unlimited team members.

The setups below are **production-grade** installations. See the [contribution docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix/) for instructions on how to build from source with [Bazel](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/bazel/), [Cargo](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/cargo/), and [Nix](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix/).

You can find a few example deployments in the [Docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/deployment-examples/kubernetes).

### 📦 Prebuilt images

Fast to spin up, but currently limited to `x86_64` systems. See the [container
registry](https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/pkgs/container/nativelink)
for all image tags and the [contribution docs](https://nativelink.com/docs/contribute/nix)
for how to build the images yourself.

**Linux x86_64**

```bash
curl -O \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5

# See https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/pkgs/container/nativelink
# to find the latest tag
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/basic_cas.json5:/config \
    -p 50051:50051 \
    ghcr.io/tracemachina/nativelink:v0.6.0 \
    config
```

**Windows x86_64**

```powershell
# Download the configuration file
Invoke-WebRequest `
    -Uri &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5&quot; `
    -OutFile &quot;basic_cas.json5&quot;

# Run the Docker container
# Note: Adjust the path if the script is not run from the directory containing basic_cas.json
docker run `
    -v ${PWD}/basic_cas.json5:/config `
    -p 50051:50051 `
    ghcr.io/tracemachina/nativelink:v0.6.0 `
    config
```

### ❄️ Raw executable with Nix

Slower, since it&#039;s built from source, but more flexible and supports MacOS.
Doesn&#039;t support native Windows, but works in WSL2.

Make sure your Nix version is recent and supports flakes. For instance, install
it via the [next-gen nix installer](https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer).

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; Executables built for MacOS are dynamically linked against libraries from Nix
&gt; and won&#039;t work on systems that don&#039;t have these libraries present.

**Linux, MacOS, WSL2**

```bash
curl -O \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json5

nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink ./basic_cas.json5
```

Buck2 is a fast, hermetic, multi-language build system, and a direct successor
to the original [Buck build system](https://buck.build) (&quot;Buck1&quot;) &amp;mdash; both
designed by Meta.

But what do those words really mean for a build system &amp;mdash; and why might
they interest you? &quot;But why Buck2?&quot; you might ask, when so many build systems
already exist?

- **Fast**. It doesn&#039;t matter whether a single build command takes 60 seconds to
  complete, or 0.1 seconds: when you have to build things, Buck2 doesn&#039;t waste
  time &amp;mdash; it calculates the critical path and gets out of the way, with
  minimal overhead. It&#039;s not just the core design, but also careful attention to
  detail that makes Buck2 so snappy. Buck2 is up to 2x faster than Buck1 _in
  practice_[^perf-note]. So you spend more time iterating, and less time
  waiting.
- **Hermetic**. When using Remote Execution[^hermetic-re-only], Buck2 becomes
  _hermetic_: it is required for a build rule to correctly declare all of its
  inputs; if they aren&#039;t specified correctly (e.g. a `.c` file needs a `.h` file
  that isn&#039;t correctly specified), the build will fail. This enforced
  correctness helps avoids entire classes of errors that most build systems
  allow, and helps ensure builds work everywhere for all users. And Buck2
  correctly tracks dependencies with far better accuracy than Buck1, in more
  languages, across more scenarios. That means &quot;it compiles on my machine&quot; can
  become a thing of the past.
- **Multi-language**. Many teams have to deal with multiple programming
  languages that have complex inter-dependencies, and struggle to express that.
  Most people settle with `make` and tie together `dune` to `pip` and `cargo`.
  But then how do you run test suites, code coverage, or query code databases?
  Buck2 is designed to support multiple languages from the start, with
  abstractions for interoperation. And because it&#039;s completely scriptable, and
  _users_ can implement language support &amp;mdash; it&#039;s incredibly flexible. Now
  your Python library can depend on an OCaml library, and your OCaml library can
  depend on a Rust crate &amp;mdash; and with a single build tool, you have a
  consistent UX to build and test and integrate all of these components.

[^perf-note]:
    This number comes from internal usage of Buck1 versus Buck2 at Meta. Please
    note that _appropriate_ comparisons with systems like Bazel have yet to be
    performed; Buck1 is the baseline because it&#039;s simply what existed and what
    had to be replaced. Please benchmark Buck2 against your favorite tools and
    let us know how it goes!

[^hermetic-re-only]:
    Buck2 currently does not sandbox _local-only_ build steps; in contrast,
    Buck2 using Remote Execution is _always_ hermetic by design. The vast
    majority of build rules are remote compatible, as well. Despite that, we
    hope to lift this restriction in the (hopefully short-term) future so that
    local-only builds are hermetic as well.

If you&#039;re familiar with systems like Buck1, [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), or
[Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) &amp;mdash; then Buck2 will feel warm and cozy,
and these ideas will be familiar. But then why create Buck2 if those already
exist? Because that isn&#039;t all &amp;mdash; the page
_[&quot;Why Buck2?&quot;](https://buck2.build/docs/about/why/)_ on our website goes into
more detail on several other important design critera that separate Buck2 from
the rest of the pack, including:

- Support for ultra-large repositories, through filesystem virtualization and
  watching for changes to the filesystem.
- Totally language-agnostic core executable, with a small API &amp;mdash; even C/C++
  support is written as a library. You can write everything from scratch, if you
  wanted.
- &quot;Buck Extension Language&quot; (BXL) can be used for self-introspection of the
  build system, allowing automation tools to inspect and run actions in the
  build graph. This allows you to more cleanly support features that need graph
  introspection, like LSPs or compilation databases.
- Support for distributed compilation, using the same Remote Execution API that
  is supported by Bazel. Existing solutions like BuildBarn, BuildBuddy, EngFlow,
  and NativeLink all work today.
- An efficient, robust, and sound design &amp;mdash; inspired by modern theory of
  build systems and incremental computation.
- And more!

[Getting Started](https://buck2.build/docs/getting_started/) guide!

## 🚧🚧🚧 **Warning** 🚧🚧🚧 &amp;mdash; rough terrain lies ahead

Buck2 currently **does not have a stable release tag at this time**. Pre-release
tags/binaries, and stable tags/binaries, will come at later dates. Despite that,
it is used extensively inside of Meta on vast amounts of code every day, and
[buck2-prelude](/prelude/) is the same code used internally for all these
builds, as well.

Meta just uses the latest committed `HEAD` version of Buck2 at all times. Your
mileage may vary &amp;mdash; but at the moment, tracking `HEAD` is ideal for
submitting bug reports and catching regressions.

The short of this is that you should consider this project and its code to be
battle-tested and working, but outside consumers will encounter quite a lot of
rough edges right now &amp;mdash; several features are missing or in progress, some
toolchains from Buck1 are missing, and you&#039;ll probably have to fiddle with
things more than necessary to get it nice and polished.

Please provide feedback by submitting
[issues and questions!](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues)

## Installing Buck2

You can get started by downloading a
[bi-monthly version](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tags) or the
[latest](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/releases/tag/latest) built binary for
your platform. The `latest` tag always refers to a recent commit; it is updated
on every single push to the GitHub repository, so it will always be a recent
version.

Alternately, you can use [dotslash](https://dotslash-cli.com/) with the
bi-monthly releases where it&#039;s easy to deploy into a repo with a single text
file and auto pull the correct platform as needed.

You can also compile Buck2 from source, if a binary isn&#039;t immediately available
for your use; check out the [HACKING.md](./HACKING.md) file for information.
