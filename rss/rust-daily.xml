# Your procedural toolbox for 2D content creation

**Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics engine, [available now](https://editor.graphite.rs) in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.**

Having begun life as a vector editor, Graphite continues evolving into a generalized, all-in-one graphics toolbox that&#039;s built more like a game engine than a conventional creative app. The editor&#039;s tools wrap its node graph core, providing user-friendly workflows for vector, raster, and beyond. Photo editing, motion graphics, digital painting, desktop publishing, and VFX compositing are additional competencies on the planned [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#roadmap) making Graphite into a highly versatile content creation tool.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Troubleshooting

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;See details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that may arise are likely due to your system missing dependencies
required to correctly analyze a network adapter. &lt;br&gt;
Check the [required dependencies page](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Required-dependencies) 
for instructions on how to proceed depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not updated,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may manifest bugs (the interface glitches, color gradients are unsupported, or some icons are completely black). &lt;br&gt;
In these cases you can set an environment variable to switch to the `tiny-skia` renderer,
a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment:

```sh
ICED_BACKEND=tiny-skia
```

### ***In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/new/choose), and I will do my best to help you!***

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The front-end to your dev env.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## What is it?

- Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html).
- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## Demo

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

[![demo](./docs/tapes/demo.gif)](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

See [demo transcript](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html).

## Quickstart

### Install mise

See [Getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for more options.

```sh-session
$ curl https://mise.run | sh
$ ~/.local/bin/mise --version
2025.6.8 macos-arm64 (a1b2d3e 2025-06-26)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@22 -- node -v
mise node@22.x.x ‚úì installed
v22.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@22 go@1
$ node -v
v22.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

## Features and Roadmap

Turso Database is a _work-in-progress_, in-process OLTP database engine library written in Rust that has:

* **SQLite compatibility** [[doc](COMPAT.md)] for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API
* **Language bindings** for JavaScript/WebAssembly, Rust, Go, Python, and [Java](bindings/java)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **OS support** for Linux, macOS, and Windows

In the future, we will be also working on:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput.
* **Indexing for vector search**.
* **Improved schema management** including better `ALTER` support and strict column types by default.

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üíª Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the shell to execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;ü¶Ä Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;‚ú® JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/turso
```

Example usage:

```js
import { Database } from &#039;@tursodatabase/turso&#039;;

const db = new Database(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üêç Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üêπ Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the library and set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include turso&#039;s target directory
```console
cargo build --package limbo-go
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/limbo/target/debug:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
3. Use the driver

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/turso
go install github.com/tursodatabase/turso
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/tursodatabase/turso&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;sqlite3&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()

    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}

## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

_The AI-native proxy server and the universal data plane for AI agents._&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Arch handles the *pesky low-level work* in building AI agents like clarifying vague user inputs, routing prompts to the right agents, calling tools for simple tasks, and unifying access to large language models (LLMs) - all without locking you into a framework. Move faster by focusing on the high-level logic of your agents.

AI demos are easy to build. But past the thrill of a quick hack, you are left building, maintaining and scaling low-level plumbing code for agents that slows down AI innovation. For example:

- You want to build specialized agents, but get stuck building **routing and handoff** code.
- You want use new LLMs, but struggle to **quickly and safely add LLMs** without writing integration code.
- You&#039;re bogged down with prompt engineering work to **clarify user intent and validate inputs**.
- You&#039;re wasting cycles choosing and integrating code for **observability** instead of it happening transparently.

With Arch, you can move faster by focusing on higher-level objectives in a language and framework agnostic way. **Arch** was built by the contributors of [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) with the belief that:

&gt;Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems to improve speed and accuracy for common agentic scenarios  ‚Äì all outside core application logic.*

**Core Features**:

  - `üö¶ Routing`. Engineered with purpose-built [LLMs](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-function-66f209a693ea8df14317ad68) for fast (&lt;100ms) agent routing and hand-off scenarios
  - `‚ö° Tools Use`: For common agentic scenarios let Arch instantly clarify and convert prompts to tools/API calls
  - `‚õ® Guardrails`: Centrally configure and prevent harmful outcomes and ensure safe user interactions
  - `üîó Access to LLMs`: Centralize access and traffic to LLMs with smart retries for continuous availability
  - `üïµ Observability`: W3C compatible request tracing and LLM metrics that instantly plugin with popular tools
  - `üß± Built on Envoy`: Arch runs alongside app servers as a containerized process, and builds on top of [Envoy&#039;s](https://envoyproxy.io) proven HTTP management and scalability features to handle ingress and egress traffic related to prompts and LLMs.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Today, the function calling LLM (Arch-Function) designed for the agentic and RAG scenarios is hosted free of charge in the US-central region. To offer consistent latencies and throughput, and to manage our expenses, we will enable access to the hosted version via developers keys soon, and give you the option to run that LLM locally. For more details see this issue [#258](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw/issues/258)

## Quickstart

Follow this quickstart guide to use arch gateway to build a simple AI agent. Laster in the section we will see how you can Arch Gateway to manage access keys, provide unified access to upstream LLMs and to provide e2e observability.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. [Docker System](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (v24)
2. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.29)
3. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.12)

Arch&#039;s CLI allows you to manage and interact with the Arch gateway efficiently. To install the CLI, simply run the following command:

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend that developers create a new Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies before installing Arch. This ensures that archgw and its dependencies do not interfere with other packages on your system.

```console
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install archgw==0.3.2
```

### Build AI Agent with Arch Gateway

In following quickstart we will show you how easy it is to build AI agent with Arch gateway. We will build a currency exchange agent using following simple steps. For this demo we will use `https://api.frankfurter.dev/` to fetch latest price for currencies and assume USD as base currency.

#### Step 1. Create arch config file

Create `arch_config.yaml` file with following content,

```yaml
version: v0.1.0

listeners:
  ingress_traffic:
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 10000
    message_format: openai
    timeout: 30s

llm_providers:
  - name: gpt-4o
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o

system_prompt: |
  You are a helpful assistant.

prompt_guards:
  input_guards:
    jailbreak:
      on_exception:
        message: Looks like you&#039;re curious about my abilities, but I can only provide assistance for currency exchange.

prompt_targets:
  - name: currency_exchange
    description: Get currency exchange rate from USD to other currencies
    parameters:
      - name: currency_symbol
        description: the currency that needs conversion
        required: true
        type: str
        in_path: true
    endpoint:
      name: frankfurther_api
      path: /v1/latest?base=USD&amp;symbols={currency_symbol}
    system_prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant. Show me the currency symbol you want to convert from USD.

  - name: get_supported_currencies
    description: Get list of supported currencies for conversion
    endpoint:
      name: frankfurther_api
      path: /v1/currencies

endpoints:
  frankfurther_api:
    endpoint: api.frankfurter.dev:443
    protocol: https
```

#### Step 2. Start arch gateway with currency conversion config

```sh

$ archgw up arch_config.yaml
2024-12-05 16:56:27,979 - cli.main - INFO - Starting archgw cli version: 0.1.5
...
2024-12-05 16:56:28,485 - cli.utils - INFO - Schema validation successful!
2024-12-05 16:56:28,485 - cli.main - INFO - Starting arch model server and arch gateway
...
2024-12-05 16:56:51,647 - cli.core - INFO - Container is healthy!

```

Once the gateway is up you can start interacting with at port 10000 using openai chat completion API.

Some of the sample queries you can ask could be `what is currency rate for gbp?` or `show me list of currencies for conversion`.

#### Step 3. Interacting with gateway using curl command

Here is a sample curl command you can use to interact,

```bash
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;what is exchange rate for gbp&quot;}], &quot;model&quot;: &quot;none&quot;}&#039; \
  http://localhost:10000/v1/chat/completions | jq &quot;.choices[0].message.content&quot;

&quot;As of the date provided in your context, December 5, 2024, the exchange rate for GBP (British Pound) from USD (United States Dollar) is 0.78558. This means that 1 USD is equivalent to 0.78558 GBP.&quot;

```

And to get list of supported currencies,

```bash
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;show me list of currencies that are supported for conversion&quot;}], &quot;model&quot;: &quot;none&quot;}&#039; \
  http://localhost:10000/v1/chat/completions | jq &quot;.choices[0].message.content&quot;

&quot;Here is a list of the currencies that are supported for conversion from USD, along with their symbols:\n\n1. AUD - Australian Dollar\n2. BGN - Bulgarian Lev\n3. BRL - Brazilian Real\n4. CAD - Canadian Dollar\n5. CHF - Swiss Franc\n6. CNY - Chinese Renminbi Yuan\n7. CZK - Czech Koruna\n8. DKK - Danish Krone\n9. EUR - Euro\n10. GBP - British Pound\n11. HKD - Hong Kong Dollar\n12. HUF - Hungarian Forint\n13. IDR - Indonesian Rupiah\n14. ILS - Israeli New Sheqel\n15. INR - Indian Rupee\n16. ISK - Icelandic Kr√≥na\n17. JPY - Japanese Yen\n18. KRW - South Korean Won\n19. MXN - Mexican Peso\n20. MYR - Malaysian Ringgit\n21. NOK - Norwegian Krone\n22. NZD - New Zealand Dollar\n23. PHP - Philippine Peso\n24. PLN - Polish Z≈Çoty\n25. RON - Romanian Leu\n26. SEK - Swedish Krona\n27. SGD - Singapore Dollar\n28. THB - Thai Baht\n29. TRY - Turkish Lira\n30. USD - United States Dollar\n31. ZAR - South African Rand\n\nIf you want to convert USD to any of these currencies, you can select the one you are interested in.&quot;

```

### Use Arch Gateway as LLM Router

#### Step 1. Create arch config file

Arch operates based on a configuration file where you can define LLM providers, prompt targets, guardrails, etc. Below is an example configuration that defines openai and mistral LLM providers.

Create `arch_config.yaml` file with following content:

```yaml
version: v0.1.0

listeners:
  egress_traffic:
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 12000
    message_format: openai
    timeout: 30s

llm_providers:
  - name: gpt-4o
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    default: true

  - name: ministral-3b
    access_key: $MISTRAL_API_KEY
    provider: openai
    model: ministral-3b-latest
```

#### Step 2. Start arch gateway

Once the config file is created ensure that you have env vars setup for `MISTRAL_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or these are defined in `.env` file).

Start arch gateway,

```
$ archgw up arch_config.yaml
2024-12-05 11:24:51,288 - cli.main - INFO - Starting archgw cli version: 0.1.5
2024-12-05 11:24:51,825 - cli.utils - INFO - Schema validation successful!
2024-12-05 11:24:51,825 - cli.main - INFO - Starting arch model server and arch gateway
...
2024-12-05 11:25:16,131 - cli.core - INFO - Container is healthy!
```

### Step 3: Interact with LLM

#### Step 3.1: Using OpenAI python client

Make outbound calls via Arch gateway

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Use the OpenAI client as usual
client = OpenAI(
  # No need to set a specific openai.api_key since it&#039;s configured in Arch&#039;s gateway
  api_key = &#039;--&#039;,
  # Set the OpenAI API base URL to the Arch gateway endpoint
  base_url = &quot;http://127.0.0.1:12000/v1&quot;
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    # we select model from arch_config file
    model=&quot;None&quot;,
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;}],
)

print(&quot;OpenAI Response:&quot;, response.choices[0].message.content)

```

#### Step 3.2: Using curl command
```
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;}], &quot;model&quot;: &quot;none&quot;}&#039; \
  http://localhost:12000/v1/chat/completions

{
  ...
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o-2024-08-06&quot;,
  &quot;choices&quot;: [
    {
      ...
      &quot;messages&quot;: {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The capital of France is Paris.&quot;,
      },
    }
  ],
...
}

```

You can override model selection using `x-arch-llm-provider-hint` header. For example if you want to use mistral using following curl command,

```
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --header &#039;x-arch-llm-provider-hint: ministral-3b&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;}], &quot;model&quot;: &quot;none&quot;}&#039; \
  http://localhost:12000/v1/chat/completions
{
  ...
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;ministral-3b-latest&quot;,
  &quot;choices&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;messages&quot;: {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The capital of France is Paris. It is the most populous city in France and is known for its iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Paris is also a major global center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture.&quot;,
      },
      ...
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

## [Observability](https://docs.archgw.com/guides/observability/observability.html)
Arch is designed to support best-in class observability by supporting open standards. Please read our [docs](https://docs.archgw.com/guides/observability/observability.html) on observability for more details on tracing, metrics, and logs. The screenshot below is from our integration with Signoz (among others)

![alt text](docs/source/_static/img/tracing.png)

## Debugging

When debugging issues / errors application logs and access logs provide key information to give you more context on whats going on with the system. Arch gateway runs in info log level and following is a typical output you could see in a typical interaction between developer and arch gateway,

```
$ archgw up --service archgw --foreground
...
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.350][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_request_body: sending request to model server
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.851][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_call_response: model server response received
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.852][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_call_response: dispatching api call to developer endpoint: weather_forecast_service, path: /weather, method: POST
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.882][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_call_response: developer api call response received: status code: 200
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.882][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_call_response: sending request to upstream llm
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.883][26][info] llm_gateway: on_http_request_body: provider: gpt-4o-mini, model requested: None, model selected: gpt-4o-mini
[2025-03-26 18:32:02.818][26][info] llm_gateway: on_http_response_body: time to first token: 1468ms
[2025-03-26 18:32:04.532][26][info] llm_gateway: on_http_response_body: request latency: 3183ms
...
```

Log level can be changed to debug to get more details. To enable debug logs edit (supervisord.conf)[arch/supervisord.conf], change the log level `--component-log-level wasm:info` to `--component-log-level wasm:debug`. And after that you need to rebuild docker image and restart the arch gateway using following set of commands,

```
# make sure you are at the root of the repo
$ archgw build
# go to your service that has arch_config.yaml file and issue following command,
$ archgw up --service archgw --foreground
```

Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. Its based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use‚Äîwhether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models‚Äîlike [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]‚Äîwith a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes‚Äîwhich is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any

start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [&quot;co-located&quot; local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary&#039;s name may change (i.e.
away from `jj`). For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

A tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines.

If you&#039;d like to help out (and you should, it&#039;s a fun project!), see
[Contributing.md](Contributing.md) and our [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

You can use rustfmt in Travis CI builds. We provide a minimal Travis CI
configuration (see [here](#checking-style-on-a-ci-server)).

## Quick start

You can run `rustfmt` with Rust 1.24 and above.

### On the Stable toolchain

To install:

```sh
rustup component add rustfmt
```

To run on a cargo project in the current working directory:

```sh
cargo fmt
```

### On the Nightly toolchain

For the latest and greatest `rustfmt`, nightly is required.

To install:

```sh
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
```

To run on a cargo project in the current working directory:

```sh
cargo +nightly fmt
```

## Limitations

Rustfmt tries to work on as much Rust code as possible. Sometimes, the code
doesn&#039;t even need to compile! In general, we are looking to limit areas of
instability; in particular, post-1.0, the formatting of most code should not
change as Rustfmt improves. However, there are some things that Rustfmt can&#039;t
do or can&#039;t do well (and thus where formatting might change significantly,
even post-1.0). We would like to reduce the list of limitations over time.

The following list enumerates areas where Rustfmt does not work or where the
stability guarantees do not apply (we don&#039;t make a distinction between the two
because in the future Rustfmt might work on code where it currently does not):

* a program where any part of the program does not parse (parsing is an early
  stage of compilation and in Rust includes macro expansion).
* Macro declarations and uses (current status: some macro declarations and uses
  are formatted).
* Comments, including any AST node with a comment &#039;inside&#039; (Rustfmt does not
  currently attempt to format comments, it does format code with comments inside, but that formatting may change in the future).
* Rust code in code blocks in comments.
* Any fragment of a program (i.e., stability guarantees only apply to whole
  programs, even where fragments of a program can be formatted today).
* Code containing non-ascii unicode characters (we believe Rustfmt mostly works
  here, but do not have the test coverage or experience to be 100% sure).
* Bugs in Rustfmt (like any software, Rustfmt has bugs, we do not consider bug
  fixes to break our stability guarantees).


## Running

You can run Rustfmt by just typing `rustfmt filename` if you used `cargo
install`. This runs rustfmt on the given file, if the file includes out of line
modules, then we reformat those too. So to run on a whole module or crate, you
just need to run on the root file (usually mod.rs or lib.rs). Rustfmt can also
read data from stdin. Alternatively, you can use `cargo fmt` to format all
binary and library targets of your crate.

You can run `rustfmt --help` for information about available arguments.
The easiest way to run rustfmt against a project is with `cargo fmt`. `cargo fmt` works on both
single-crate projects and [cargo workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html).
Please see `cargo fmt --help` for usage information.

You can specify the path to your own `rustfmt` binary for cargo to use by setting the`RUSTFMT` 
environment variable. This was added in v1.4.22, so you must have this version or newer to leverage this feature (`cargo fmt --version`)

### Running `rustfmt` directly

To format individual files or arbitrary codes from stdin, the `rustfmt` binary should be used. Some
examples follow:

- `rustfmt lib.rs main.rs` will format &quot;lib.rs&quot; and &quot;main.rs&quot; in place
- `rustfmt` will read a code from stdin and write formatting to stdout
  - `echo &quot;fn     main() {}&quot; | rustfmt` would emit &quot;fn main() {}&quot;.

For more information, including arguments and emit options, see `rustfmt --help`.

### Verifying code is formatted

When running with `--check`, Rustfmt will exit with `0` if Rustfmt would not
make any formatting changes to the input, and `1` if Rustfmt would make changes.
In other modes, Rustfmt will exit with `1` if there was some error during
formatting (for example a parsing or internal error) and `0` if formatting
completed without error (whether or not changes were made).



## Running Rustfmt from your editor

* [Vim](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim#formatting-with-rustfmt)
* [Emacs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-mode)
* [Sublime Text 3](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/RustFmt)
* [Atom](atom.md)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
* [IntelliJ or CLion](intellij.md)


## Checking style on a CI server

To keep your code base consistently formatted, it can be helpful to fail the CI build
when a pull request contains unformatted code. Using `--check` instructs
rustfmt to exit with an error code if the input is not formatted correctly.
It will also print any found differences. (Older versions of Rustfmt don&#039;t
support `--check`, use `--write-mode diff`).

A minimal Travis setup could look like this (requires Rust 1.31.0 or greater):

```yaml
language: rust
before_script:
- rustup component add rustfmt
script:
- cargo build
- cargo test
- cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

See [this blog post](https://medium.com/@ag_dubs/enforcing-style-in-ci-for-rust-projects-18f6b09ec69d)
for more info.

## How to build and test

`cargo build` to build.

`cargo test` to run all tests.

To run rustfmt after this, use `cargo run --bin rustfmt -- filename`. See the
notes above on running rustfmt.


## Configuring Rustfmt

Rustfmt is designed to be very configurable. You can create a TOML file called
`rustfmt.toml` or `.rustfmt.toml`, place it in the project or any other parent
directory and it will apply the options in that file. See `rustfmt
--help=config` for the options which are available, or if you prefer to see
visual style previews, [GitHub page](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/).

By default, Rustfmt uses a style which conforms to the [Rust style guide][style
guide] that has been formalized through the [style RFC
process][fmt rfcs].

Configuration options are either stable or unstable. Stable options can always
be used, while unstable ones are only available on a nightly toolchain, and opt-in.
See [GitHub page](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/) for details.

### Rust&#039;s Editions

The `edition` option determines the Rust language edition used for parsing the code. This is important for syntax compatibility but does not directly control formatting behavior (see [Style Editions](#style-editions)).

When running `cargo fmt`, the `edition` is automatically read from the `Cargo.toml` file. However, when running `rustfmt` directly, the `edition` defaults to 2015. For consistent parsing between rustfmt and `cargo fmt`, you should configure the `edition` in your `rustfmt.toml` file:

```toml
edition = &quot;2018&quot;
```

### Style Editions

This option is inferred from the [`edition`](#rusts-editions) if not specified.

See [Rust Style Editions] for details on formatting differences between style editions.
rustfmt has a default style edition of `2015` while `cargo fmt` infers the style edition from the `edition` set in `Cargo.toml`. This can lead to inconsistencies between `rustfmt` and `cargo fmt` if the style edition is not explicitly configured.

To ensure consistent formatting, it is recommended to specify the `style_edition` in a `rustfmt.toml` configuration file. For example:

```toml
style_edition = &quot;2024&quot;
```
[Rust Style Editions]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/editions.html?highlight=editions#rust-style-editions
[Rust Style Guide]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/
[RFC 3338]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3338-style-evolution.html

## Tips

* To ensure consistent parsing between `cargo fmt` and `rustfmt`, you should configure the [`edition`](#rusts-editions) in your `rustfmt.toml` file.
* To ensure consistent formatting between `cargo fmt` and `rustfmt`, you should configure the [`style_edition`](#style-editions) in your `rustfmt.toml` file.

* For things you do not want rustfmt to mangle, use `#[rustfmt::skip]`
* To prevent rustfmt from formatting a macro or an attribute,
  use `#[rustfmt::skip::macros(target_macro_name)]` or
  `#[rustfmt::skip::attributes(target_attribute_name)]`

  Example:

    ```rust
    #![rustfmt::skip::attributes(custom_attribute)]

    #[custom_attribute(formatting , here , should , be , Skipped)]
    #[rustfmt::skip::macros(html)]
    fn main() {
        let macro_result1 = html! { &lt;div&gt;
    Hello&lt;/div&gt;
        }.to_string();
    ```
* When you run rustfmt, place a file named `rustfmt.toml` or `.rustfmt.toml` in
  target file directory or its parents to override the default settings of
  rustfmt. You can generate a file containing the default configuration with
  `rustfmt --print-config default rustfmt.toml` and customize as needed.
* After successful compilation, a `rustfmt` executable can be found in the
  target directory.
* If you&#039;re having issues compiling Rustfmt (or compile errors when trying to
  install), make sure you have the most recent version of Rust installed.

* You can change the way rustfmt emits the changes with the --emit flag:

  Example:

  ```sh
  cargo fmt -- --emit files
  ```

  Options:

  | Flag |Description| Nightly Only |
  |:---:|:---:|:---:|
  | files | overwrites output to files | No |
  | stdout | writes output to stdout | No |
  | coverage | displays how much of the input file was processed | Yes |
  | checkstyle | emits in a checkstyle format | Yes |
  | json | emits diffs in a json format | Yes |

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevy.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevy.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,

# MicroBin

![Build](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/microbin.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/microbin)
[![Docker Image](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/danielszabo99/microbin)
[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/danielszabo99/microbin?label=Docker%20pulls)](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/danielszabo99/microbin?label=Docker%20pulls)

MicroBin is a super tiny, feature-rich, configurable, self-contained and self-hosted paste bin web application. It is very easy to set up and use, and will only require a few megabytes of memory and disk storage. It takes only a couple minutes to set it up, why not give it a try now?

### Check out the Public Test Server at [pub.microbin.eu](https://pub.microbin.eu)!

### Or host MicroBin yourself

Run our quick docker setup script ([DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/danielszabo99/microbin)):
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -s https://microbin.eu/docker.sh)
```

Or install it manually from [Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/microbin):

```bash
cargo install microbin;
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szabodanika/microbin/master/.env;
source .env;
microbin
```

On our website [microbin.eu](https://microbin.eu), you will find the following:

- [Screenshots](https://microbin.eu/screenshots/)
- [Guide and Documentation](https://microbin.eu/docs/intro)
- [Donations and Sponsorships](https://microbin.eu/sponsorship)
- [Roadmap](https://microbin.eu/roadmap)

## Features

- Entirely self-contained executable, MicroBin is a single file!
- Server-side and client-side encryption
- File uploads (e.g. `server.com/file/pig-dog-cat`)
- Raw text serving (e.g. `server.com/raw/pig-dog-cat`)
- QR code support
- URL shortening and redirection
- Animal names instead of random numbers for upload identifiers (64 animals)
- SQLite and JSON database support
- Private and public, editable and uneditable, automatically and never expiring uploads
- Automatic dark mode and custom styling support with very little CSS and only vanilla JS (see [`water.css`](https://github.com/kognise/water.css))
- And much more!

## What is an upload?

In MicroBin, an upload can be:

- A text that you want to paste from one machine to another, e.g. some code,
- A file that you want to share, e.g. a video that is too large for Discord, a zip with a code project in it or an image,
- A URL redirection.

## When is MicroBin useful?

You can use MicroBin:

- To send long texts to other people,
- To send large files to other people,
- To share secrets or sensitive documents securely,
- As a URL shortener/redirect service,
- To serve content on the web, eg . configuration files for testing, images, or any other file content using the Raw functionality,
- To move files between your desktop and a server you access from the console,
- As a &quot;postbox&quot; service where people can upload their files or texts, but they cannot see or remove what others sent you,
- Or even to take quick notes.

...and many other things, why not get creative?

## Getting Started

For information relating to the development of Rust applications on ESP devices, please first read [The Rust on ESP Book].

For information about the HAL and how to use it in your own projects, please refer to the [documentation].

When browsing the examples, we recommend viewing the tag for the `esp-hal` release you are using to ensure compatibility, e.g. [esp-hal-v1.0.0-beta.0], as the `main` branch is used for development and APIs may have changed in the meantime.

# Arnis [![CI Build Status](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/actions) [&lt;img alt=&quot;GitHub Release&quot; src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/louis-e/arnis&quot; /&gt;](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases) [&lt;img alt=&quot;GitHub Downloads (all assets, all releases&quot; src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/louis-e/arnis/total&quot; /&gt;](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases)

Arnis creates complex and accurate Minecraft Java Edition worlds that reflect real-world geography and architecture using OpenStreetMap.

###### ‚ö†Ô∏è This Github page is the official project website. Do not download Arnis from any other website.

## :desktop_computer: Example
![Minecraft Preview](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/mc.gif?raw=true)

Arnis is designed to handle large-scale data and generate rich, immersive environments that bring real-world cities, landmarks, and natural features into Minecraft. Whether you&#039;re looking to replicate your hometown, explore urban environments, or simply build something unique and realistic, Arnis generates your vision.

## :keyboard: Usage
&lt;img width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/gui.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases/) or [compile](#trophy-open-source) the project on your own.
 
Choose your area using the rectangle tool and select your Minecraft world - then simply click on &#039;Start Generation&#039;!

&gt; The world will always be generated starting from the Minecraft coordinates 0 0 0 (/tp 0 0 0). This is the top left of your selected area.
Minecraft version 1.16.5 and below is currently not supported, but we are working on it! For the best results, use Minecraft version 1.21.4 or above.
If you choose to select an own world, be aware that Arnis will overwrite certain areas.

![eza demo gif](docs/images/screenshots.png)

---

**eza** is a modern alternative for the venerable file-listing command-line program `ls` that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it‚Äôs **small**, **fast**, and just **one single binary**.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, eza attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of `ls`.

---

**eza** features not in exa (non-exhaustive):

- Fixes [‚ÄúThe Grid Bug‚Äù](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/issues/66#issuecomment-1656758327) introduced in exa 2021.
- Hyperlink support.
- Mount point details.
- Selinux context output.
- Git repo status output.
- Human readable relative dates.
- Several security fixes.
- Support for `bright` terminal colours.
- Many smaller bug fixes/changes!
- Configuration `theme.yml` file for customization of colors and icons.

...and like, so much more that it became exhausting to update this all the time.
Like seriously, we have a lot of good stuff.

---

&lt;a id=&quot;try-it&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Try it!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

### Nix ‚ùÑÔ∏è

If you already have Nix setup with flake support, you can try out eza with the `nix run` command:

    nix run github:eza-community/eza

Nix will build eza and run it.

If you want to pass arguments this way, use e.g. `nix run github:eza-community/eza -- -ol`.

# Installation

eza is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Platform and distribution
specific installation instructions can be found in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/eza.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/eza/versions)

---

&lt;a id=&quot;options&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Command-line options&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

- in your terminal via `man eza`, as of version [`[0.18.13] - 2024-04-25`](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01813---2024-04-25)
&lt;/details&gt;


## Custom Themes
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

**Eza** has recently added support for a `theme.yml` file, where you can specify all of the existing theme-ing options
available for the `LS_COLORS` and `EXA_COLORS` environment variables, as well as the option to specify different icons
for different file types and extensions. Any existing environment variables set will continue to work and will take
precedence for backwards compatibility.

#### **New** Pre-made themes
Check out the themes available in the official [eza-themes](https://github.com/eza-community/eza-themes) repository, or contribute your own.

An example theme file is available in `docs/theme.yml`, and needs to either be placed in a directory specified by the 
environment variable `EZA_CONFIG_DIR`, or will looked for by default in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/eza`.

Full details are available on the [man page](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/man/eza_colors-explanation.5.md) and an example theme file is included [here](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/docs/theme.yml)

&lt;/div&gt;

Vello is a 2D graphics rendering engine written in Rust, with a focus on GPU compute.
It can draw large 2D scenes with interactive or near-interactive performance, using [`wgpu`] for GPU access.

Quickstart to run an example program:

```shell
cargo run -p with_winit
```

![image](https://github.com/linebender/vello/assets/8573618/cc2b742e-2135-4b70-8051-c49aeddb5d19)

It is used as the rendering backend for [Xilem], a Rust GUI toolkit.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Vello can currently be considered in an alpha state. In particular, we&#039;re still working on the following:
&gt;
&gt; - [Implementing blur and filter effects](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/476).
&gt; - [Conflations artifacts](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/49).
&gt; - [GPU memory allocation strategy](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/366)
&gt; - [Glyph caching](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/204)

Significant changes are documented in [the changelog].

## Motivation

Vello is meant to fill the same place in the graphics stack as other vector graphics renderers like [Skia](https://skia.org/), [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/), and its predecessor project [Piet](https://github.com/linebender/piet).
On a basic level, that means it provides tools to render shapes, images, gradients, text, etc, using a PostScript-inspired API, the same that powers SVG files and [the browser `&lt;canvas&gt;` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).

Vello&#039;s selling point is that it gets better performance than other renderers by better leveraging the GPU.
In traditional PostScript-style renderers, some steps of the render process like sorting and clipping either need to be handled in the CPU or done through the use of intermediary textures.
Vello avoids this by using prefix-sum algorithms to parallelize work that usually needs to happen in sequence, so that work can be offloaded to the GPU with minimal use of temporary buffers.

This means that Vello needs a GPU with support for compute shaders to run.

## Getting started

Vello is meant to be integrated deep in UI render stacks.
While drawing in a Vello scene is easy, actually rendering that scene to a surface requires setting up a wgpu context, which is a non-trivial task.

To use Vello as the renderer for your PDF reader / GUI toolkit / etc, your code will have to look roughly like this:

```rust
use vello::{
    kurbo::{Affine, Circle},
    peniko::{Color, Fill},
    *,
};

// Initialize wgpu and get handles
let (width, height) = ...;
let device: wgpu::Device = ...;
let queue: wgpu::Queue = ...;
let mut renderer = Renderer::new(
   &amp;device,
   RendererOptions::default()
).expect(&quot;Failed to create renderer&quot;);
// Create scene and draw stuff in it
let mut scene = vello::Scene::new();
scene.fill(
   vello::peniko::Fill::NonZero,
   vello::Affine::IDENTITY,
   vello::Color::from_rgb8(242, 140, 168),
   None,
   &amp;vello::Circle::new((420.0, 200.0), 120.0),
);
// Draw more stuff
scene.push_layer(...);
scene.fill(...);
scene.stroke(...);
scene.pop_layer(...);
let texture = device.create_texture(&amp;...);

// Render to a wgpu Texture
renderer
   .render_to_texture(
      &amp;device,
      &amp;queue,
      &amp;scene,
      &amp;texture,
      &amp;vello::RenderParams {
         base_color: palette::css::BLACK, // Background color
         width,
         height,
         antialiasing_method: AaConfig::Msaa16,
      },
   )
   .expect(&quot;Failed to render to a texture&quot;);
// Do things with `texture`, such as blitting it to the Surface using
// wgpu::util::TextureBlitter
```

See the [`examples`](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples) directory for code that integrates with frameworks like winit.

## Performance

We&#039;ve observed 177 fps for the paris-30k test scene on an M1 Max, at a resolution of 1600 pixels square, which is excellent performance and represents something of a best case for the engine.

More formal benchmarks are on their way.

## Integrations

### SVG

A separate Linebender integration for rendering SVG files is available through [`vello_svg`](https://github.com/linebender/vello_svg).

### Lottie

A separate Linebender integration for playing Lottie animations is available through [`velato`](https://github.com/linebender/velato).

### Bevy

A separate Linebender integration for rendering raw scenes or Lottie and SVG files in [Bevy] through [`bevy_vello`](https://github.com/linebender/bevy_vello).

## Examples

Our examples are provided in separate packages in the [`examples`](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples) directory.
This allows them to have independent dependencies and faster builds.
Examples must be selected using the `--package` (or `-p`) Cargo flag.

### Winit

Our [winit] example ([examples/with_winit](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples/with_winit)) demonstrates rendering to a [winit] window.
By default, this renders the [GhostScript Tiger] as well as all SVG files you add in the [examples/assets/downloads](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples/assets/downloads) directory.
A custom list of SVG file paths (and directories to render all SVG files from) can be provided as arguments instead.
It also includes a collection of test scenes showing the capabilities of `vello`, which can be shown with `--test-scenes`.

```shell
cargo run -p with_winit
```

&lt;!-- ### Headless --&gt;

## Platforms

We aim to target all environments which can support WebGPU with the [default limits](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#limits).
We defer to [`wgpu`] for this support.
Other platforms are more tricky, and may require special building/running procedures.

### Web

Because Vello relies heavily on compute shaders, we rely on the emerging WebGPU standard to run on the web.
Browser support for WebGPU is still evolving.
Vello has been tested using production versions of Chrome, but WebGPU support in Firefox and Safari is still experimental.
It may be necessary to use development browsers and explicitly enable WebGPU.

The following command builds and runs a web version of the [winit demo](#winit).
This uses [`cargo-run-wasm`](https://github.com/rukai/cargo-run-wasm) to build the example for web, and host a local server for it

```shell
# Make sure the Rust toolchain supports the wasm32 target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# The binary name must also be explicitly provided as it differs from the package name
cargo run_wasm -p with_winit --bin with_winit_bin
```

There is also a web demo [available here](https://linebender.github.io/vello) on supporting web browsers.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The web is not currently a primary target for Vello, and WebGPU implementations are incomplete, so you might run into issues running this example.

### Android

The [`with_winit`](#winit) example supports running on Android, using [cargo apk](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk).

```shell
cargo apk run -p with_winit --lib
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; cargo apk doesn&#039;t support running in release mode without configuration.
&gt; See [their crates page docs](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk) (around `package.metadata.android.signing.&lt;profile&gt;`).
&gt;
&gt; See also [cargo-apk#16](https://github.com/rust-mobile/cargo-apk/issues/16).
&gt; To run in release mode, you must add the following to `examples/with_winit/Cargo.toml` (changing `$HOME` to your home directory):

```toml
[package.metadata.android.signing.release]
path = &quot;$HOME/.android/debug.keystore&quot;
keystore_password = &quot;android&quot;
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; As `cargo apk` does not allow passing command line arguments or environment variables to the app when ran, these can be embedded into the
&gt; program at compile time (currently for Android only)
&gt; `with_winit` currently supports the environment variables:
&gt;
&gt; - `VELLO_STATIC_LOG`, which is equivalent to `RUST_LOG`
&gt; - `VELLO_STATIC_ARGS`, which is equivalent to passing in command line arguments

For example (with unix shell environment variable syntax):

```sh
VELLO_STATIC_LOG=&quot;vello=trace&quot; VELLO_STATIC_ARGS=&quot;--test-scenes&quot; cargo apk run -p with_winit --lib
```

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Vello has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.85** and later.

Future versions of Vello might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click here if compiling fails.&lt;/summary&gt;

As time has passed, some of Vello&#039;s dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don&#039;t want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency&#039;s name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## History

Vello was previously known as `piet-gpu`.
This prior incarnation used a custom cross-API hardware abstraction layer, called `piet-gpu-hal`, instead of [`wgpu`].

An archive of this version can be found in the branches [`custom-hal-archive-with-shaders`] and [`custom-hal-archive`].
This succeeded the previous prototype, [piet-metal], and included work adapted from [piet-dx12].

The decision to lay down `piet-gpu-hal` in favor of WebGPU is discussed in detail in the blog post [Requiem for piet-gpu-hal].

A [vision](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/doc/vision.md) document dated December 2020 explained the longer-term goals of the project, and how we might get there.
Many of these items are out-of-date or completed, but it still may provide some useful background.

Wasmer is a _blazing fast_ and _secure_ [**WebAssembly**](https://webassembly.org) runtime that enables incredibly
_lightweight containers_ to run anywhere: from _Desktop_ to the _Cloud_, _Edge_ and your browser.

- **Secure** by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.
- **Pluggable**. supports [**WASIX**](https://wasix.org/), [WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) out of the box.
- **Incredibly Fast**. Run WebAssembly at near-native speeds.
- **Embeddable** [anywhere via Wasmer SDKs](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/#wasmer-sdk)

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

([egui ÁöÑ‰∏≠ÊñáÁøªËØëÊñáÊ°£ / chinese translation](https://github.com/Re-Ch-Love/egui-doc-cn/blob/main/README_zh-hans.md))


## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies:

* [`ab_glyph`](https://crates.io/crates/ab_glyph)
* [`ahash`](https://crates.io/crates/ahash)
* [`bitflags`](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags)
* [`nohash-hasher`](https://crates.io/crates/nohash-hasher)
* [`parking_lot`](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)

Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, ‚Ä¶)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

&lt;hr /&gt;

Lance is a modern columnar data format that is optimized for ML workflows and datasets. Lance is perfect for:

1. Building search engines and feature stores.
2. Large-scale ML training requiring high performance IO and shuffles.
3. Storing, querying, and inspecting deeply nested data for robotics or large blobs like images, point clouds, and more.

The key features of Lance include:

* **High-performance random access:** 100x faster than Parquet without sacrificing scan performance.

* **Vector search:** find nearest neighbors in milliseconds and combine OLAP-queries with vector search.

* **Zero-copy, automatic versioning:** manage versions of your data without needing extra infrastructure.

* **Ecosystem integrations:** Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Ray, Spark and more on the way.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Lance is in active development and we welcome contributions. Please see our [contributing guide](docs/contributing.rst) for more information.

## Quick Start

**Installation**

```shell
pip install pylance
```

To install a preview release:

```shell
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/ pylance
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Preview releases are released more often than full releases and contain the
&gt; latest features and bug fixes. They receive the same level of testing as full releases.
&gt; We guarantee they will remain published and available for download for at
&gt; least 6 months. When you want to pin to a specific version, prefer a stable release.

**Converting to Lance**

```python
import lance

import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.dataset

df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;a&quot;: [5], &quot;b&quot;: [10]})
uri = &quot;/tmp/test.parquet&quot;
tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
pa.dataset.write_dataset(tbl, uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)

parquet = pa.dataset.dataset(uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)
lance.write_dataset(parquet, &quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
```

**Reading Lance data**
```python
dataset = lance.dataset(&quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
assert isinstance(dataset, pa.dataset.Dataset)
```

**Pandas**
```python
df = dataset.to_table().to_pandas()
df
```

**DuckDB**
```python
import duckdb

# If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM dataset LIMIT 10&quot;).to_df()
```

**Vector search**

Download the sift1m subset

```shell
wget ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz
tar -xzf sift.tar.gz
```

Convert it to Lance

```python
import lance
from lance.vector import vec_to_table
import numpy as np
import struct

nvecs = 1000000
ndims = 128
with open(&quot;sift/sift_base.fvecs&quot;, mode=&quot;rb&quot;) as fobj:
    buf = fobj.read()
    data = np.array(struct.unpack(&quot;&lt;128000000f&quot;, buf[4 : 4 + 4 * nvecs * ndims])).reshape((nvecs, ndims))
    dd = dict(zip(range(nvecs), data))

table = vec_to_table(dd)
uri = &quot;vec_data.lance&quot;
sift1m = lance.write_dataset(table, uri, max_rows_per_group=8192, max_rows_per_file=1024*1024)
```

Build the index

```python
sift1m.create_index(&quot;vector&quot;,
                    index_type=&quot;IVF_PQ&quot;,
                    num_partitions=256,  # IVF
                    num_sub_vectors=16)  # PQ
```

Search the dataset

```python
# Get top 10 similar vectors
import duckdb

dataset = lance.dataset(uri)

# Sample 100 query vectors. If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
sample = duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT vector FROM dataset USING SAMPLE 100&quot;).to_df()
query_vectors = np.array([np.array(x) for x in sample.vector])

# Get nearest neighbors for all of them
rs = [dataset.to_table(nearest={&quot;column&quot;: &quot;vector&quot;, &quot;k&quot;: 10, &quot;q&quot;: q})
      for q in query_vectors]
```

## What makes Lance different

Here we will highlight a few aspects of Lance‚Äôs design. For more details, see the full [Lance design document](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/format.html).

**Vector index**: Vector index for similarity search over embedding space.
Support both CPUs (``x86_64`` and ``arm``) and GPU (``Nvidia (cuda)`` and ``Apple Silicon (mps)``).

**Encodings**: To achieve both fast columnar scan and sub-linear point queries, Lance uses custom encodings and layouts.

**Nested fields**: Lance stores each subfield as a separate column to support efficient filters like ‚Äúfind images where detected objects include cats‚Äù.

**Versioning**: A Manifest can be used to record snapshots. Currently we support creating new versions automatically via appends, overwrites, and index creation.

**Fast updates** (ROADMAP): Updates will be supported via write-ahead logs.

**Rich secondary indices**: Support `BTree`, `Bitmap`, `Full text search`, `Label list`,
`NGrams`, and more.

## Benchmarks

### Vector search

We used the SIFT dataset to benchmark our results with 1M vectors of 128D

1. For 100 randomly sampled query vectors, we get &lt;1ms average response time (on a 2023 m2 MacBook Air)

![avg_latency.png](docs/avg_latency.png)

2. ANNs are always a trade-off between recall and performance

![avg_latency.png](docs/recall_vs_latency.png)

### Vs. parquet

We create a Lance dataset using the Oxford Pet dataset to do some preliminary performance testing of Lance as compared to Parquet and raw image/XMLs. For analytics queries, Lance is 50-100x better than reading the raw metadata. For batched random access, Lance is 100x better than both parquet and raw files.

## Why are you building yet another data format?!

The machine learning development cycle involves the steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --&gt; B[Exploration];
    B --&gt; C[Analytics];
    C --&gt; D[Feature Engineer];
    D --&gt; E[Training];

    F --&gt; C;
    E --&gt; G[Deployment];
    G --&gt; H[Monitoring];
    H --&gt; A;
```

People use different data representations to varying stages for the performance or limited by the tooling available.
Academia mainly uses XML / JSON for annotations and zipped images/sensors data for deep learning, which
is difficult to integrate into data infrastructure and slow to train over cloud storage.
While industry uses data lakes (Parquet-based techniques, i.e., Delta Lake, Iceberg) or data warehouses (AWS Redshift
or Google BigQuery) to collect and analyze data, they have to convert the data into training-friendly formats, such
as [Rikai](https://github.com/eto-ai/rikai)/[Petastorm](https://github.com/uber/petastorm)
or [TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord).
Multiple single-purpose data transforms, as well as syncing copies between cloud storage to local training
instances have become a common practice.

While each of the existing data formats excels at the workload it was originally designed for, we need a new data format
tailored for multistage ML development cycles to reduce and data silos.

A comparison of different data formats in each stage of ML development cycle.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Linux GPU Control Application

&lt;img src=&quot;res/io.github.ilya_zlobintsev.LACT.png&quot; alt=&quot;icon&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;

This application allows you to control your AMD, Nvidia or Intel GPU on a Linux
system.

Current features:

- Viewing information about the GPU
- Power and thermals monitoring, power limit configuration
- Fan curve control (AMD and Nvidia)
- Overclocking (GPU/VRAM clockspeed and voltage)
- Power states configuration (AMD only)

All of the functionality works regardless of the desktop session (there is no
dependency on X11 extensions).

- OpenSUSE: an RPM is available in
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  Only tumbleweed is supported as leap does not have the required dependencies
  in the repos.
- NixOS: There is a package available in
  [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=24.05&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=packages&amp;query=lact)
- Flatpak (universal): Available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.ilya_zlobintsev.LACT) and in [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  See the [Flatpak documentation](./flatpak/README.md) for setup notes.
- Build from source.

Note: Nvidia support requires the Nvidia proprietary driver with CUDA libraries
installed.

## Development builds

To get latest fixes or features that have not yet been released in a stable
version, there are packages built from the latest commit that you can install
from the
[test release](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/test-build)
or using the `lact-git` AUR package on Arch-based distros.

Note: the date that GitHub shows next to the test release is not when the packages were built,
the actual date is specified next to the attached package files.

# Usage

Enable and start the service (otherwise you won&#039;t be able to change any
settings):

```
sudo systemctl enable --now lactd
```

You can now use the GUI to change settings and view information.

# Hardware support

See the
[Wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Hardware-Support)

# Configuration

There is a configuration file available in `/etc/lact/config.yaml`. Most of the
settings are accessible through the GUI, but some of them may be useful to be
edited manually (like `admin_group` and `admin_user` to specify who has access
to the daemon)

See [CONFIG.md](./docs/CONFIG.md) for more information.

**Socket permissions setup:**

By default, LACT uses either ether the `wheel` or `sudo` group (whichever is
available) for the ownership of the unix socket that the GUI needs to connect
to.

On most desktop configurations (such as the default setup on Arch-based, most
Debian-based or Fedora systems) this includes the default user, so you do not
need to configure this.

However, some systems may have different user configuration. In particular, this
has been reported to be a problem on OpenSUSE.

To fix socket permissions in such configurations, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml`
and under the `daemon` section either:

- Set `admin_user` to your username
- Set `admin_group` to a group that your user is a part of Then restart the
  service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

# Overclocking (AMD)

Some functionality requires enabling an option in the amdgpu driver, see the
[wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Overclocking-(AMD)) for
more information.

## Power profiles daemon note!

If you are using `power-profiles-daemon` (which is installed by default on many
distributions), by default it may override the amdgpu performance level setting
according to its own profile.

When using LACT 0.7.5+ and power-profiles-daemon 0.30+, LACT will try to connect to power-profiles-daemon 
and automatically disable the conflicting amdgpu action in ppd to avoid this conflict.

If running older versions, you can resolve this manually by creating a file at
`/etc/systemd/system/power-profiles-daemon.service.d/override.conf` with the
following contents:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/power-profiles-daemon --block-action=amdgpu_dpm
```

Note: the `/usr/libexec` path might be different on your system, check it in
`systemctl status power-profiles-daemon`

See https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/issues/370 for more information.

# Suspend/Resume

As some of the GPU settings may get reset when suspending the system, LACT will
reload them on system resume. This may not work on distributions which don&#039;t use
systemd, as it relies on the `org.freedesktop.login2` DBus interface.

# Building from source

Dependencies:

- rust 1.76+
- gtk 4.6+
- git
- pkg-config
- clang
- make
- hwdata
- libdrm
- vulkan-tools
- ocl-icd

Command to install all dependencies:

- Fedora:
  `sudo dnf install rust cargo make git clang gtk4-devel libdrm-devel vulkan-tools OpenCL-ICD-Loader-devel`
- Arch:
  `sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git clang make rust gtk4 hwdata vulkan-tools ocl-icd`

Steps:

- `git clone https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT &amp;&amp; cd LACT`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`

It&#039;s possible to change which features LACT gets built with. To do so, replace
the `make` command with the following variation:

Headless build with no GUI:

```
make build-release-headless
```

Build GUI with libadwaita support:

```
make build-release-libadwaita
```

# Remote management

It&#039;s possible to have the LACT daemon running on one machine, and then manage it
remotely from another.

This is disabled by default, as the TCP connection **does not have any
authentication or encryption mechanism!** Make sure to only use it in trusted
networks and/or set up appropriate firewall rules.

To enable it, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml` and add `tcp_listen_address` with
your desired address and in the `daemon` section.

Example:

```yaml
daemon:
  tcp_listen_address: 0.0.0.0:12853
  log_level: info
  admin_group: wheel
  disable_clocks_cleanup: false
```

After this restart the service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

To connect to a remote instance with the GUI, run it with
`lact gui --tcp-address 192.168.1.10:12853`.

# CLI

There is also a cli available.

- List system GPUs:

  `lact cli list-gpus`

  Example output:

  ```
  10DE:2704-1462:5110-0000:09:00.0 (AD103 [GeForce RTX 4080])
  ```
- Getting GPU information:

  `lact cli info`

  Example output:

  ```
  $ lact cli info
  GPU 10DE:2704-1462:5110-0000:09:00.0:
  =====================================
  GPU Model: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 (0x10DE:0x2704)
  Card Manufacturer: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd. [MSI] (0x1462)
  Card Model: Unknown (0x5110)
  Driver Used: nvidia 570.124.04
  VBIOS Version: 95.03.1E.00.60
  VRAM Size: 16376 MiB
  GPU Family: Ada
  Cuda Cores: 9728
  SM Count: 76
  ROP Count: 112 (14 * 8)
  VRAM Type: GDDR6x
  VRAM Manufacturer: Micron
  L2 Cache: 65536 KiB
  Resizeable bar: Enabled
  CPU Accessible VRAM: 16384
  Link Speed: 8 GT/s PCIe gen 3 x8
  ```

The functionality of the CLI is quite limited. If you want to integrate LACT
with some application/script, you should use the [API](API.md) instead.

# Reporting issues

When reporting issues, please include your system info and GPU model.

If you&#039;re having an issue with changing the GPU&#039;s configuration, it&#039;s highly
recommended to include a debug snapshot in the bug report. You can generate one
using the option in the dropdown menu:

![image](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/assets/22796665/36dda5e3-981b-47e7-914e-6e29f30616b4)

The snapshot is an archive which includes the SysFS that LACT uses to interact
with the GPU.

If there&#039;s a crash, run `lact gui` from the command line to get GUI logs, check
daemon logs in `journalctl -u lactd` for errors, and see `dmesg` for kernel logs
that might include information about driver and system issues.

# Other tools

Here&#039;s a list of other useful tools for AMD GPUs on Linux:

- [CoreCtrl](https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl) - direct alternative to LACT,
  provides similar functionality in addition to CPU configuration with a Qt UI
- [amdgpu_top](https://github.com/Umio-Yasuno/amdgpu_top) - tool for detailed
  real-time statistics on AMD GPUs
- [Tuxclocker](https://github.com/Lurkki14/tuxclocker) - Qt overclocking tool,
  has support for AMD GPUs

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ ‚Äî the state of your application
* __Messages__ ‚Äî user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ ‚Äî a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ ‚Äî a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(&quot;A cool counter&quot;, Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

Read the [book], the [documentation], and the [examples] to learn more!

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

**Slint** is an open-source declarative GUI toolkit for building native user interfaces for embedded systems, desktops, and mobile platforms.

Write your UI once in `.slint`, a simple markup language. Connect it to business logic written in Rust, C++, JavaScript, or Python.

## Why Slint?

The name *Slint* is derived from our design goals:

- **Scalable**: Slint should support responsive UI design, allow cross-platform
    usage across operating systems and processor architectures and support
    multiple programming languages.
- **Lightweight**: Slint should require minimal resources, in terms of memory
    and processing power, and yet deliver a smooth, smartphone-like user
    experience on any device.
- **Intuitive**: Designers and developers should feel productive while enjoying
    the GUI design and development process. The design creation tools should be
    intuitive to use for the designers. Similarly for the developers, the APIs
    should be consistent and easy to use, no matter which programming language
    they choose.
- **Native**: GUI built with Slint should match the end users&#039; expectations of a
    native application irrespective of the platform - desktop, mobile, web or
    embedded system. The UI design should be compiled to machine code and provide
    flexibility that only a native application can offer: Access full operating
    system APIs, utilize all CPU and GPU cores, connect to any peripheral.

Beyond the design goals, here‚Äôs what makes Slint stand out:

- **Independent UI Design**: Use a declarative language similar to separate your UI from business logic. Designers can work in parallel with developers.
- **Tooling**: Iterate quickly with our Live Preview &amp; editor integrations. Integrate from Figma with the [Slint To Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1474418299182276871/figma-to-slint).
- **Stable APIs**: Slint follows a stable 1.x API. We evolve carefully without breaking your code.

## Get Started

### Hello World

The UI is defined in a Domain Specific Language that is declarative, easy to use,
intuitive, and provides a powerful way to describe graphical elements, their
placement, their hierarchy, property bindings, and the flow of data through the
different states.

Here&#039;s the obligatory &quot;Hello World&quot;:

```slint
export component HelloWorld inherits Window {
    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;

    Text {
       y: parent.width / 2;
       x: parent.x + 200px;
       text: &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
       color: blue;
    }
}
```

### Documentation

For more details, check out the [Slint Language Documentation](https://slint.dev/docs/slint).

The [examples](examples) folder contains examples and demos, showing how to
use the Slint markup language and how to interact with a Slint user interface
from supported programming languages.

The `docs` folder contains a lot more information, including
[build instructions](docs/building.md), and
[internal developer docs](docs/development.md).

Refer to the README of each language directory in the `api` folder:

- [C++](api/cpp) ([Documentation][#15] | [Getting Started Template][#17])
- [Rust](api/rs/slint) [![Crates.io][#18]][#19] ([Documentation][#20] | [Tutorial Video][#22] | [Getting Started Template][#23])
- [JavaScript/NodeJS (Beta)](api/node) [![npm][#24]][#25] ([Documentation][#26] | [Getting Started Template][#28])
- [Python (Beta)](api/python/slint) [![pypi][#31]][#32] ([Documentation][#33] | [Getting Started Template][#34])

## Architecture

An application is composed of the business logic written in Rust, C++, or
JavaScript and the `.slint` user interface design markup, which is compiled to
native code.

![Architecture Overview](https://slint.dev/resources/architecture.drawio.svg)

### Compiler

The `.slint` files are compiled ahead of time. The expressions in the `.slint`
are pure functions that the compiler can optimize. For example, the compiler
could choose to &quot;inline&quot; properties and remove those that are constant or
unchanged.

The compiler uses the typical compiler phases of lexing, parsing, optimization,
and finally code generation. It provides different back-ends for code generation
in the target language. The C++ code generator produces a C++ header file, the
Rust generator produces Rust code, and so on. An interpreter for dynamic
languages is also included.

### Runtime

The runtime library consists of an engine that supports properties declared in
the `.slint` language. Components with their elements, items, and properties are
laid out in a single memory region, to reduce memory allocations.

Rendering backends and styles are configurable at compile time:

- The `femtovg` renderer uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.
- The `skia` renderer uses [Skia](https://skia.org) for rendering.
- The `software` renderer uses the CPU with no additional dependencies.

NOTE: When Qt is installed on the system, the `qt` style becomes available,
using Qt&#039;s QStyle to achieve native looking widgets.

### Tooling

We have a few tools to help with the development of .slint files:

- A [**LSP Server**](./tools/lsp) that adds features like auto-complete and live
  preview of the .slint files to many editors.
- It is bundled in a [**Visual Studio Code Extension**](./editors/vscode)
  available from the market place.
- A [**slint-viewer**](./tools/viewer) tool which displays the .slint files. The
  `--auto-reload` argument makes it easy to preview your UI while you are
  working on it (when using the LSP preview is not possible).
- [**SlintPad**](https://slintpad.com/), an online editor to try out .slint syntax
  without installing anything ([sources](./tools/slintpad)).
- A [**Figma to Slint**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1474418299182276871/figma-to-slint) plugin.

Please check our [Editors README](./editors/README.md) for tips on how to
configure your favorite editor to work well with Slint.
