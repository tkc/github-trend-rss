### **The self-learning, self-optimizing vector database — with graph intelligence, local AI, and PostgreSQL built in.**

&gt; Created by [rUv](https://ruv.io) and powering [Cognitum](https://cognitum.one), a 🏅 **CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree** — the world&#039;s first Agentic Chip designed to be always running for AI agents. Tens of thousands of agents, near-zero power, learns from every signal. [Learn more →](https://cognitum.one)


```bash
npx ruvector
```

####  Most vector databases store your data and search it — the same way, every time. 

#### **RuVector** is fundamentally different. It watches how you use it and gets smarter: search results improve automatically, the system tunes itself to your workload, and it runs AI models right on your hardware — no cloud APIs, no per-query bills, GPUs optional, CPUs preferred. It drops into PostgreSQL, runs in browsers, and ships as a single file. 

Open source. ❤️ Free forever.

### Built by rUv, powered by [Cognitum.one](https://cognitum.one)

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitum Hardware — The Agentic Appliance &amp; Chip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

**Cognitum v0 — The Agentic Appliance**: Run tens of thousands of always-on agents at no incremental cost beyond the box. Learns in proximity to any signal — sensors, networks, machines — at near-zero power (~5 uW/inference, &lt;15W total). Sub-millisecond response, 500x cheaper than cloud AI. No cloud bills, no per-agent fees. Like a nervous system, not a brain.

**Cognitum v1 — The Agentic Chip**: Same architecture on a single 257-core custom chip. Runs on less than 2W — a AA battery. Idle-to-8 GHz burst on demand, 2 TB/s interconnect, built-in encryption per core.

&lt;/details&gt;

### A Complete Agentic AI Operating System

Our hosted service, Chroma Cloud, powers serverless vector, hybrid, and full-text search. It&#039;s extremely fast, cost-effective, scalable and painless. Create a DB and try it out in under 30 seconds with $5 of free credits.

[Get started with Chroma Cloud](https://trychroma.com/signup)

## API

The core API is only 4 functions (run our [💡 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing)):

```python
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection(&quot;all-my-documents&quot;)

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=[&quot;This is document1&quot;, &quot;This is document2&quot;], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;notion&quot;}, {&quot;source&quot;: &quot;google-docs&quot;}], # filter on these!

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Chroma allows you to store these vectors or embeddings and search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/integrations/embedding-models/sentence-transformer#sentence-transformer) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

**v3.6 Refactoring**

- Backend: 5-phase refactoring (error handling → command split → tests → services → concurrency)
- Frontend: 4-stage refactoring (test infra → hooks → components → cleanup)
- Testing: 100% hooks coverage + integration tests (vitest + MSW)

## Installation

The Wasmtime CLI can be installed on Linux and macOS (locally) with a small install
script:

```console
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```
This script installs into `$WASMTIME_HOME` (defaults to `$HOME/.wasmtime`), and executable is placed in `$WASMTIME_HOME/bin`.

After running the install script above, follow the on-screen instructions.

Windows or otherwise interested users can download installers and
binaries directly from the [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) page.

For additional installation options, refer to the [online book CLI installation page](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/cli-install.html).

Documentation on Wasmtime&#039;s currently supported versions can be found [in the
online book
documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html#current-versions).

## Example

If you&#039;ve got the [Rust compiler
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then you can take some Rust
source code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
```

and compile it into a WebAssembly component with:

```console
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
rustc hello.rs --target wasm32-wasip2
```

Once compiled, you can run your component:

```console
wasmtime hello.wasm
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Hello, world!
```

(Note: make sure you installed Rust using the [`rustup`][rustup] method in the official
instructions above, and do not have a copy of the Rust toolchain installed on
your system in some other way as well (e.g. the system package manager). Otherwise, the `rustup target add...`
command may not install the target for the correct copy of Rust.)

## Features

* **Fast**. Wasmtime is built on the optimizing [Cranelift] code generator to
  quickly generate high-quality machine code either at runtime or
  ahead-of-time. Wasmtime is optimized for efficient instantiation, low-overhead
  calls between the embedder and wasm, and scalability of concurrent instances.

* **[Secure]**. Wasmtime&#039;s development is strongly focused on correctness and
  security. Building on top of Rust&#039;s runtime safety guarantees, each Wasmtime
  feature goes through careful review and consideration via an [RFC
  process]. Once features are designed and implemented, they undergo 24/7
  fuzzing donated by [Google&#039;s OSS Fuzz]. As features stabilize they become part
  of a [release][release policy], and when things go wrong we have a
  well-defined [security policy] in place to quickly mitigate and patch any
  issues. We follow best practices for defense-in-depth and integrate
  protections and mitigations for issues like Spectre. Finally, we&#039;re working to
  push the state-of-the-art by collaborating with academic researchers to
  formally verify critical parts of Wasmtime and Cranelift.

* **[Configurable]**. Wasmtime uses sensible defaults, but can also be
  configured to provide more fine-grained control over things like CPU and
  memory consumption. Whether you want to run Wasmtime in a tiny environment or
  on massive servers with many concurrent instances, we&#039;ve got you covered.

* **[WASI]**. Wasmtime supports a rich set of APIs for interacting with the host
  environment through the [WASI standard](https://wasi.dev).

* **[Standards Compliant]**. Wasmtime passes the [official WebAssembly test
  suite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite), implements the [official C
  API of wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), and implements
  [future proposals to WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) as
  well. Wasmtime developers are intimately engaged with the WebAssembly
  standards process all along the way too.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the snippet below into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

##  安装指南 (Installation)

### 选项 A: 终端安装 (推荐)

#### 跨平台一键安装脚本

自动检测操作系统、架构和包管理器，一条命令完成下载与安装。

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/v4.1.26/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

&gt; **支持的格式**: Linux (`.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage`) | macOS (`.dmg`) | Windows (NSIS `.exe`)
&gt;
&gt; **高级用法**: 安装指定版本 `curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --version 4.1.26`，预览模式 `curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --dry-run`

#### macOS - Homebrew
如果您已安装 [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)，也可以通过以下命令安装：

```bash
# 1. 订阅本仓库的 Tap
brew tap lbjlaq/antigravity-manager https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager

# 2. 安装应用
brew install --cask antigravity-tools
```
&gt; **提示**: 如果遇到权限问题，建议添加 `--no-quarantine` 参数。

#### Arch Linux
您可以选择通过一键安装脚本或 Homebrew 进行安装：

**方式 1：一键安装脚本 (推荐)**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/main/deploy/arch/install.sh | bash
```

**方式 2：通过 Homebrew** (如果您已安装 [Linuxbrew](https://sh.brew.sh/))
```bash
brew tap lbjlaq/antigravity-manager https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager
brew install --cask antigravity-tools
```

#### 其他 Linux 发行版
安装后会自动将 AppImage 添加到二进制路径并配置可执行权限。

### 选项 B: 手动下载
前往 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/releases) 下载对应系统的包：
*   **macOS**: `.dmg` (支持 Apple Silicon &amp; Intel)
*   **Windows**: `.msi` 或 便携版 `.zip`
*   **Linux**: `.deb` 或 `AppImage`

### 选项 C: Docker 部署 (推荐用于 NAS/服务器)
如果您希望在容器化环境中运行，我们提供了原生的 Docker 镜像。该镜像内置了对 v4.0.2 原生 Headless 架构的支持，可自动托管前端静态资源，并通过浏览器直接进行管理。

```bash
# 方式 1: 直接运行 (推荐)
# - API_KEY: 必填。用于所有协议的 AI 请求鉴定。
# - WEB_PASSWORD: 可选。用于管理后台登录。若不设置则默认使用 API_KEY。
docker run -d --name antigravity-manager \
  -p 8045:8045 \
  -e API_KEY=sk-your-api-key \
  -e WEB_PASSWORD=your-login-password \
  -e ABV_MAX_BODY_SIZE=104857600 \
  -v ~/.antigravity_tools:/root/.antigravity_tools \
  lbjlaq/antigravity-manager:latest

# 忘记密钥？执行 docker logs antigravity-manager 或 grep -E &#039;&quot;api_key&quot;|&quot;admin_password&quot;&#039; ~/.antigravity_tools/gui_config.json

#### 🔐 鉴权逻辑说明
*   **场景 A：仅设置了 `API_KEY`**
    - **Web 登录**：使用 `API_KEY` 进入后台。
    - **API 调用**：使用 `API_KEY` 进行 AI 请求鉴权。
*   **场景 B：同时设置了 `API_KEY` 和 `WEB_PASSWORD` (推荐)**
    - **Web 登录**：**必须**使用 `WEB_PASSWORD`，使用 API Key 将被拒绝（更安全）。
    - **API 调用**：统一使用 `API_KEY`。这样您可以将 API Key 分发给成员，而保留密码仅供管理员使用。

#### 🆙 旧版本升级指引
如果您是从 v4.0.1 及更早版本升级，系统默认未设置 `WEB_PASSWORD`。您可以通过以下任一方式设置：
1.  **Web UI 界面 (推荐)**：使用原有 `API_KEY` 登录后，在 **API 反代设置** 页面手动设置并保存。新密码将持久化存储在 `gui_config.json` 中。
2.  **环境变量 (Docker)**：在启动容器时增加 `-e WEB_PASSWORD=您的新密码`。**注意：环境变量具有最高优先级，将覆盖 UI 中的任何修改。**
3.  **配置文件 (持久化)**：直接修改 `~/.antigravity_tools/gui_config.json`，在 `proxy` 对象中修改或添加 `&quot;admin_password&quot;: &quot;您的新密码&quot;` 字段。
    - *注：`WEB_PASSWORD` 是环境变量名，`admin_password` 是配置文件中的 JSON 键名。*

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **密码优先级逻辑 (Priority)**:
&gt; - **第一优先级 (环境变量)**: `ABV_WEB_PASSWORD` 或 `WEB_PASSWORD`。只要设置了环境变量，系统将始终使用它。
&gt; - **第二优先级 (配置文件)**: `gui_config.json` 中的 `admin_password` 字段。UI 的“保存”操作会更新此值。
&gt; - **保底回退 (向后兼容)**: 若上述均未设置，则回退使用 `API_KEY` 作为登录密码。

# 方式 2: 使用 Docker Compose
# 1. 进入项目的 docker 目录
cd docker
# 2. 启动服务
docker compose up -d
```
&gt; **访问地址**: `http://localhost:8045` (管理后台) | `http://localhost:8045/v1` (API Base)
&gt; **系统要求**:
&gt; - **内存**: 建议 **1GB** (最小 256MB)。
&gt; - **持久化**: 需挂载 `/root/.antigravity_tools` 以保存数据。
&gt; - **架构**: 支持 x86_64 和 ARM64。
&gt; **详情见**: [Docker 部署指南 (docker)](./docker/README.md)

### 🛠️ 常见问题排查 (Troubleshooting)

#### macOS 提示“应用已损坏，无法打开”？
由于 macOS 的安全机制，非 App Store 下载的应用可能会触发此提示。您可以按照以下步骤快速修复：

1.  **命令行修复** (推荐):
    打开终端，执行以下命令：
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine &quot;/Applications/Antigravity Tools.app&quot;
    ```
2.  **Homebrew 安装技巧**:
    如果您使用 brew 安装，可以添加 `--no-quarantine` 参数来规避此问题：
    ```bash
    brew install --cask --no-quarantine antigravity-tools
    ```

## 🔌 快速接入示例

### 🔐 OAuth 授权流程（添加账号）
1. 打开“Accounts / 账号” → “添加账号” → “OAuth”。
2. 弹窗会在点击按钮前预生成授权链接；点击链接即可复制到系统剪贴板，然后用你希望的浏览器打开并完成授权。
3. 授权完成后浏览器会打开本地回调页并显示“✅ 授权成功!”。
4. 应用会自动继续完成授权并保存账号；如未自动完成，可点击“我已授权，继续”手动完成。

&gt; 提示：授权链接包含一次性回调端口，请始终使用弹窗里生成的最新链接；如果授权时应用未运行或弹窗已关闭，浏览器可能会提示 `localhost refused connection`。

### 如何接入 Claude Code CLI?
1.  启动 Antigravity，并在“API 反代”页面开启服务。
2.  在终端执行：
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045&quot;
claude
```

### 如何接入 OpenCode?
1.  进入 **API 反代**页面 → **外部 Providers** → 点击 **OpenCode Sync** 卡片。
2.  点击 **Sync** 按钮，将自动生成 `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` 配置文件：
    - 创建独立 provider `antigravity-manager`（不覆盖 google/anthropic 原生配置）
    - 可选：勾选 **Sync accounts** 导出 `antigravity-accounts.json`（plugin-compatible v3 格式），供 OpenCode 插件直接导入
3.  点击 **Clear Config** 可一键清除 Manager 配置并清理 legacy 残留；点击 **Restore** 可从备份恢复。
4.  Windows 用户路径为 `C:\Users\&lt;用户名&gt;\.config\opencode\`（与 `~/.config/opencode` 规则一致）。

**快速验证命令：**
```bash
# 测试 antigravity-manager provider（支持 --variant）
opencode run &quot;test&quot; --model antigravity-manager/claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking --variant high

# 若已安装 opencode-antigravity-auth 插件，验证 google provider 仍可独立工作
opencode run &quot;test&quot; --model google/antigravity-claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking --variant max
```

### 如何接入 Kilo Code?
1.  **协议选择**: 建议优先使用 **Gemini 协议**。
2.  **Base URL**: 填写 `http://127.0.0.1:8045`。
3.  **注意**: 
    - **OpenAI 协议限制**: Kilo Code 在使用 OpenAI 模式时，其请求路径会叠加产生 `/v1/chat/completions/responses` 这种非标准路径，导致 Antigravity 返回 404。因此请务必填入 Base URL 后选择 Gemini 模式。
    - **模型映射**: Kilo Code 中的模型名称可能与 Antigravity 默认设置不一致，如遇到无法连接，请在“模型映射”页面设置自定义映射，并查看**日志文件**进行调试。

### 如何在 Python 中使用?
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;,
    base_url=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1&quot;
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-flash&quot;,
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;你好，请自我介绍&quot;}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 如何使用图片生成 (Imagen 3)?

#### 方式一：OpenAI Images API (推荐)
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;,
    base_url=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1&quot;
)

# 生成图片
response = client.images.generate(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    prompt=&quot;一座未来主义风格的城市，赛博朋克，霓虹灯&quot;,
    size=&quot;1920x1080&quot;,      # 支持任意 WIDTHxHEIGHT 格式，自动计算宽高比
    quality=&quot;hd&quot;,          # &quot;standard&quot; | &quot;hd&quot; | &quot;medium&quot;
    n=1,
    response_format=&quot;b64_json&quot;
)

# 保存图片
import base64
image_data = base64.b64decode(response.data[0].b64_json)
with open(&quot;output.png&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;) as f:
    f.write(image_data)
```

**支持的参数**：
- **`size`**: 任意 `WIDTHxHEIGHT` 格式（如 `1280x720`, `1024x1024`, `1920x1080`），自动计算并映射到标准宽高比（21:9, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, 1:1）
- **`quality`**: 
  - `&quot;hd&quot;` → 4K 分辨率（高质量）
  - `&quot;medium&quot;` → 2K 分辨率（中等质量）
  - `&quot;standard&quot;` → 默认分辨率（标准质量）
- **`n`**: 生成图片数量（1-10）
- **`response_format`**: `&quot;b64_json&quot;` 或 `&quot;url&quot;`（Data URI）

#### 方式二：Chat API + 参数设置 (✨ 新增)

**所有协议**（OpenAI、Claude）的 Chat API 现在都支持直接传递 `size` 和 `quality` 参数：

```python
# OpenAI Chat API
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    size=&quot;1920x1080&quot;,      # ✅ 支持任意 WIDTHxHEIGHT 格式
    quality=&quot;hd&quot;,          # ✅ &quot;standard&quot; | &quot;hd&quot; | &quot;medium&quot;
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

```bash
# Claude Messages API
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1/messages \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;x-api-key: sk-antigravity&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;: &quot;1280x720&quot;,
    &quot;quality&quot;: &quot;hd&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一只可爱的猫咪&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

```

**参数优先级**: `imageSize` 参数 &gt; `quality` 参数 &gt; 模型后缀

**✨ 新增 `imageSize` 参数支持**:

除了 `quality` 参数外,现在还支持直接使用 Gemini 原生的 `imageSize` 参数:

```python
# 使用 imageSize 参数(最高优先级)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    size=&quot;16:9&quot;,           # 宽高比
    imageSize=&quot;4K&quot;,        # ✨ 直接指定分辨率: &quot;1K&quot; | &quot;2K&quot; | &quot;4K&quot;
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

```bash
# Claude Messages API 也支持 imageSize
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1/messages \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;x-api-key: sk-antigravity&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;: &quot;1280x720&quot;,
    &quot;imageSize&quot;: &quot;4K&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一只可爱的猫咪&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

**参数说明**:
- **`imageSize`**: 直接指定分辨率 (`&quot;1K&quot;` / `&quot;2K&quot;` / `&quot;4K&quot;`)
- **`quality`**: 通过质量等级推断分辨率 (`&quot;standard&quot;` → 1K, `&quot;medium&quot;` → 2K, `&quot;hd&quot;` → 4K)
- **优先级**: 如果同时指定 `imageSize` 和 `quality`,系统会优先使用 `imageSize`


#### 方式三：Chat 接口 + 模型后缀
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image-16-9-4k&quot;,  # 格式：gemini-3-pro-image-[比例]-[质量]
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

**模型后缀说明**：
- **宽高比**: `-16-9`, `-9-16`, `-4-3`, `-3-4`, `-21-9`, `-1-1`
- **质量**: `-4k` (4K), `-2k` (2K), 不加后缀（标准）
- **示例**: `gemini-3-pro-image-16-9-4k` → 16:9 比例 + 4K 分辨率

#### 方式四：Cherry Studio 等客户端设置
在支持 OpenAI 协议的客户端（如 Cherry Studio）中，可以通过**模型设置**页面配置图片生成参数：

1. **进入模型设置**：选择 `gemini-3-pro-image` 模型
2. **配置参数**：
   - **Size (尺寸)**: 输入任意 `WIDTHxHEIGHT` 格式（如 `1920x1080`, `1024x1024`）
   - **Quality (质量)**: 选择 `standard` / `hd` / `medium`
   - **Number (数量)**: 设置生成图片数量（1-10）
3. **发送请求**：直接在对话框中输入图片描述即可

**参数映射规则**：
- `size: &quot;1920x1080&quot;` → 自动计算为 `16:9` 宽高比
- `quality: &quot;hd&quot;` → 映射为 `4K` 分辨率
- `quality: &quot;medium&quot;` → 映射为 `2K` 分辨率


## 📝 开发者与社区

*   **版本演进 (Changelog)**:
    *   **v4.1.26 (2026-02-27)**:
        -   **[功能增强] 优化配额刷新逻辑，支持同步禁用账号**:
            -   **逻辑放宽**: “刷新所有”和“批量刷新”现在不再跳过标记为 `disabled` 或 `proxy_disabled` 的账号。
            -   **自动恢复**: 允许通过刷新操作尝试重新激活因 Token 过期或临时错误而被禁用的账号，提升了多账号管理的灵活性。
        -   **[核心修复] 修复 Windows 系统下后台任务导致 cmd 黑框闪烁的问题**:
            -   **静默执行**: 通过为 `std::process::Command` 封装注入 `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` 标志，解决了在 Windows 端应用底层组件（如版本探测、重启更新等）调用系统命令时引发的命令行窗口一闪而过的视觉干扰，确保全过程无边框静默执行。
    *   **v4.1.25 (2026-02-27)**:
        -   **[核心功能] 动态画图模型与新架构支持**:
            -   **动态解析**: 移除了针对 `gemini-3-pro-image` 的硬编码限制。通过新增的 `clean_image_model_name` 智能清洗后缀（如 `-4k`, `-16x9`），全面兼容如 `gemini-3.1-flash-image` 等任意未来新增的画图模型。
            -   **配额自适应**: 优化了 `normalize_to_standard_id`，使用 `image` 关键词宽泛匹配，确保新模型也能正确触发配额保护机制。
        -   **[核心功能] 聊天接口 (Chat Completions) 画图拦截支持**:
            -   **跨界融合**: OpenAI 和 Claude 协议的对话流现在能智能探测画像生成意图。当使用带有 `image` 的模型名时，系统会将常规文本生成请求静默转移给高级画图引擎。
            -   **流式回显**: 生成完成后，通过 Markdown 格式（`![Generated Image](url)`）以 SSE 流式返回图片链接，完美适配所有支持 Markdown 的聊天客户端。
        -   **[核心修复] 彻底修复画图重定向 404 与参数穿透失效**:
            -   **404 移除**: 移除了底层调用中残留的旧模型硬编码，根除因模型信息不一致导致的 404 Not Found 崩溃及账号受损。
            -   **精准参数继承**: 修复了未传参数时系统强制塞入默认 `1024x1024` 的行为。现在，如果模型名带有后缀（如 `gemini-3-pro-image-16x9-4k`），后台会严格优先解析后缀分辨率进行穿透绘图。
    *   **v4.1.24 (2026-02-26)**:
        -   **[功能调整] 禁用自动预热调度程序，保留手动预热**:
            -   **变更说明**: 为了减少不必要的后台资源占用，本版本已注释掉自动预热（Smart Warmup）的后台调度逻辑。
            -   **设置隐藏**: 设置页面中的“智能预热”配置项已隐藏。
            -   **手动保留**: 账号管理页面的手动预热功能保持不变，仍可正常使用。
            -   **恢复指引**: 如果您需要自动预热功能，可以自行拉取本项目源代码，在 `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` 中取消 `start_scheduler` 的注释并解除 `Settings.tsx` 中相关 UI 的注释后重新编译使用。
        -   **[核心修复] 智能版本指纹选择与启动 Panic 修复 (Issue #2123)**:
            -   **问题根源**: 1) `constants.rs` 中的 `KNOWN_STABLE_VERSION` 硬编码了低版本号，当本地 IDE 检测失败时回退该版本作为请求头，导致 Google 拒绝 Gemini 3.1 Pro 模型。2) 新增的远端版本网络调用直接在 `LazyLock` 初始化（Tokio 异步上下文）中执行，导致 `Cannot block the current thread` 严重崩溃。
            -   **修复方案**: 1) 引入&quot;智能最大版本&quot;策略 `max(本地版本, 远端版本, 4.1.26)`，始终取最高值。2) 将网络探测逻辑移至独立 OS 线程并配合 `mpsc` 通道，安全避开异步运行时限制。保证无论本地版本新旧，指纹均不低于上游要求，且应用能稳定启动。
        -   **[核心修复] 动态模型 maxOutputTokens 限额系统 (替代 PR #2119 硬编码方案)**:
            -   **问题根源**: 部分客户端发送的 `maxOutputTokens` 超过模型物理上限（如 Flash 限制 64k），导致上游返回 400 错误。
            -   **三层限额架构**:
                -   **第一层（动态优先）**: 实时读取账号 `quota.models` 数据。
                -   **第二层（静态默认表）**: `model_limits.rs` 内置已知限额（如 Flash 65536）。
                -   **第三层（全局兜底）**: 默认 131072。
            -   **实现细节**: 在 `wrap_request()` 中注入裁剪逻辑，确保请求参数合法。
    *   **v4.1.23 (2026-02-25)**:
        -   **[安全增强] 优化与原生对齐应用层与底层特征指纹，提升请求稳定性与防拦截能力。**
        -   **[核心修复] 将 v1beta thinkingLevel 转换为 v1internal thinkingBudget (PR #2095)**:
            -   **问题根源**: OpenClaw、Cline 等客户端发送 v1beta 格式的 `thinkingLevel` 字符串（`&quot;NONE&quot;` / `&quot;LOW&quot;` / `&quot;MEDIUM&quot;` / `&quot;HIGH&quot;`）到 `generationConfig.thinkingConfig`。当 AGM 通过 Google v1internal API 代理请求时，Google 会因为 v1internal 仅接受数字型 `thinkingBudget` 而拒绝请求，返回 `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`。
            -   **修复方案**: 在 `wrap_request()` 的现有 budget 处理逻辑之前，新增一个早期转换步骤：检测 `thinkingLevel` 字符串，将其映射为对应的数字 `thinkingBudget`（`NONE`→0, `LOW`→4096, `MEDIUM`→8192, `HIGH`→24576），然后删除 `thinkingLevel` 字段并写入 `thinkingBudget`，确保下游所有 budget 处理逻辑（预算封顶、`maxOutputTokens` 调整、自适应检测）都能看到正确的数值预算。
            -   **测试**: 已验证 OpenClaw 发送 `thinkingLevel: &quot;LOW&quot;` 到 `gemini-3.1-pro-high`（Gemini 原生协议），请求现返回 `200 OK`，不再报 400 错误。
        -   **[核心修复] 账号数据损坏与后台任务无限循环修复 (PR #2094)**:
            -   **问题根源**: 当用户在设置中输入过大的刷新间隔值（如 999999999）时，`interval * 60 * 1000` 超过 JS 引擎 32 位有符号整数上限 `2,147,483,647ms`，浏览器会将 `setInterval` 延迟静默截断为 1ms，导致前端每秒触发数千次 `refreshAllQuotas`/`syncAccountFromDb` 请求，进而引发多线程并发写同一 `[uuid].json` 文件，造成字节流交错、JSON 尾部残留，账号数据永久损坏。
            -   **原子文件写入 (`account.rs`)**: `save_account` 改为先写入 UUID 后缀的临时文件，再通过 `fs::rename`（POSIX）/ `MoveFileExW`（Windows）原子替换目标文件，与已有的 `save_account_index` 保持一致，从根本上消除并发写导致的 JSON 损坏。
            -   **setInterval 溢出保护 (`BackgroundTaskRunner.tsx`)**: 对 `refresh_interval` 和 `sync_interval` 两个定时器的延迟参数加上 `Math.min(..., 2147483647)` 上界限制，防止超过 INT32_MAX 后被浏览器截断为 1ms 无限循环。
            -   **输入验证 (`Settings.tsx`)**: 将 `refresh_interval` 和 `sync_interval` 输入框的 `max` 属性从 `60` 更新为 `35791`（35791 min × 60000 &lt; INT32_MAX），并在 `onChange` 中添加 `NaN` fallback（默认为 1）及范围夹紧 `[1, 35791]`，从源头阻断非法值输入。
        -   **[核心优化] OAuth 换票专属：剔除 JA3 指纹与动态 User-Agent 伪装**:
            -   **纯净请求**: 仅针对 `exchange_code`（首次授权）和 `refresh_access_token`（静默续期）的换票请求，移除了底层网络库的 Chrome JA3 指纹伪装，恢复标准纯净的 TLS特征。
            -   **动态 UA**: 换票时自动提取编译时版本号 (`CURRENT_VERSION`) 构建专属的 `User-Agent`（如 `vscode/1.X.X (Antigravity/4.1.26)`），以匹配纯净 TLS 链路。
        -   **[功能增强] API 反代页面与设置页模型列表全面接入动态模型数据**:
            -   **问题根源**: &quot;API 反代 → 支持模型与集成&quot;列表与&quot;模型路由中心&quot;的目标模型选择下拉框，以及&quot;设置 → 固定配额模型&quot;列表，此前均仅从静态 `MODEL_CONFIG` 读取硬编码模型信息，导致账号实际下发的动态新模型（如 `GPT-OSS 120B`、`Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)` 等）无法出现在这些列表中。
            -   **修复方案**:
                -   重构 `useProxyModels` Hook：以账号 `quota.models` 动态数据为第一优先数据源，聚合所有账号里所有模型的 `display_name`（为主展示名称）和 `name`（为模型 ID）；`MODEL_CONFIG` 仅作为图标/分组的样式补充，以及无账号数据时的静态兜底。
                -   新增自动懒加载逻辑：`ApiProxy` 页面本身不调用 `fetchAccounts`，现在 Hook 内部检测到 store 为空时自动触发，保证动态模型在任意导航路径下均可正常展示。
                -   重构 `PinnedQuotaModels` 组件：采用同等策略，从 `useAccountStore` 拉取全账号动态模型，并修复了已固定的 &quot;thinking&quot;

            <h2>README</h2><pre>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i -g @openai/codex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or &lt;code&gt;brew install --cask codex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codex CLI&lt;/strong&gt; is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally on your computer.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/.github/codex-cli-splash.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI splash&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
If you want Codex in your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide&quot;&gt;install in your IDE.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;If you want the desktop app experience, run &lt;code&gt;codex app&lt;/code&gt; or visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/codex?app-landing-page=true&quot;&gt;the Codex App page&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/br&gt;If you are looking for the &lt;em&gt;cloud-based agent&lt;/em&gt; from OpenAI, &lt;strong&gt;Codex Web&lt;/strong&gt;, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/codex&quot;&gt;chatgpt.com/codex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).

## Overview

AI coding agents are increasingly writing the world&#039;s code and human engineers now spend the majority of their time planning, reviewing, and orchestrating tasks. Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:

- Easily switch between different coding agents
- Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence
- Quickly review work and start dev servers
- Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on
- Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs
- Open projects remotely via SSH when running Vibe Kanban on a remote server

You can watch a video overview [here](https://youtu.be/TFT3KnZOOAk).

Please do not open PRs without first discussing your proposal with the team.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (&gt;=20)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (&gt;=8)

Additional development tools:
```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Running the dev server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the backend and web app. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.

### Building the web app

To build just the web app:

```bash
cd packages/local-web
pnpm run build
```

### Build from source (macOS)

1. Run `./local-build.sh`
2. Test with `cd npx-cli &amp;&amp; node bin/cli.js`

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |
| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |
| `PORT` | Runtime | Auto-assign | **Production**: Server port. **Dev**: Frontend port (backend uses PORT+1) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT+1) |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend dev server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT) |
| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |
| `MCP_HOST` | Runtime | Value of `HOST` | MCP server connection host (use `127.0.0.1` when `HOST=0.0.0.0` on Windows) |
| `MCP_PORT` | Runtime | Value of `BACKEND_PORT` | MCP server connection port |
| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable all git worktree cleanup including orphan and expired workspace cleanup (for debugging) |
| `VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Runtime | Not set | Comma-separated list of origins that are allowed to make backend API requests (e.g., `https://my-vibekanban-frontend.com`) |
| `VK_SHARED_API_BASE` | Runtime | Not set | Base URL for the remote/cloud API used by the local desktop app |
| `VK_SHARED_RELAY_API_BASE` | Runtime | Not set | Base URL for the relay API used by tunnel-mode connections |
| `VK_TUNNEL` | Runtime | Not set | Enable relay tunnel mode when set (requires relay API base URL) |

**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.

#### Self-Hosting with a Reverse Proxy or Custom Domain

When running Vibe Kanban behind a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, Caddy, Traefik) or on a custom domain, you must set the `VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. Without this, the browser&#039;s Origin header won&#039;t match the backend&#039;s expected host, and API requests will be rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.

Set it to the full origin URL(s) where your frontend is accessible:

```bash
# Single origin
VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://vk.example.com

# Multiple origins (comma-separated)
VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://vk.example.com,https://vk-staging.example.com
```

### Remote Deployment

When running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (e.g., via systemctl, Docker, or cloud hosting), you can configure your editor to open projects via SSH:

1. **Access via tunnel**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or similar to expose the web UI
2. **Configure remote SSH** in Settings → Editor Integration:
   - Set **Remote SSH Host** to your server hostname or IP
   - Set **Remote SSH User** to your SSH username (optional)
3. **Prerequisites**:
   - SSH access from your local machine to the remote server
   - SSH keys configured (passwordless authentication)
   - VSCode Remote-SSH extension

When configured, the &quot;Open in VSCode&quot; buttons will generate URLs like `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path` that open your local editor and connect to the remote server.

See the [documentation](https://vibekanban.com/docs/configuration-customisation/global-settings#remote-ssh-configuration) for detailed setup instructions.

 _The AI-native proxy server and data plane for agentic apps._&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Plano pulls out the rote plumbing work and decouples you from brittle framework abstractions, centralizing what shouldn’t be bespoke in every codebase - like agent routing and orchestration, rich agentic signals and traces for continuous improvement, guardrail filters for safety and moderation, and smart LLM routing APIs for model agility. Use any language or AI framework, and deliver agents faster to production.

# Overview
Building agentic demos is easy. Shipping agentic applications safely, reliably, and repeatably to production is hard. After the thrill of a quick hack, you end up building the “hidden middleware” to reach production: routing logic to reach the right agent, guardrail hooks for safety and moderation, evaluation and observability glue for continuous learning, and model/provider quirks scattered across frameworks and application code.

Plano solves this by moving core delivery concerns into a unified, out-of-process dataplane.

- **🚦 Orchestration:** Low-latency orchestration between agents; add new agents without modifying app code.
- **🔗 Model Agility:** Route [by model name, alias (semantic names) or automatically via preferences](#use-plano-as-a-llm-router).
- **🕵 Agentic Signals&amp;trade;:** Zero-code capture of [Signals](https://docs.planoai.dev/concepts/signals.html) plus OTEL traces/metrics across every agent.
- **🛡️ Moderation &amp; Memory Hooks:** Build jailbreak protection, add moderation policies and memory consistently via [Filter Chains](https://docs.planoai.dev/concepts/filter_chain.html).

Plano pulls rote plumbing out of your framework so you can stay focused on what matters most: the core product logic of your agentic applications. Plano is backed by [industry-leading LLM research](https://planoai.dev/research) and built on [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.io) by its core contributors, who built critical infrastructure at scale for modern worklaods.

**Jump to our [docs](https://docs.planoai.dev)** to learn how you can use Plano to improve the speed, safety and obervability of your agentic applications.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Plano and the Arch family of LLMs (like Plano-Orchestrator-4B, Arch-Router, etc) are hosted free of charge in the US-central region to give you a great first-run developer experience of Plano. To scale and run in production, you can either run these LLMs locally or contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pGZf2gcwEc) for API keys.

## Build Agentic Apps with Plano

Plano handles **orchestration, model management, and observability** as modular building blocks - letting you configure only what you need (edge proxying for agentic orchestration and guardrails, or LLM routing from your services, or both together) to fit cleanly into existing architectures. Below is a simple multi-agent travel agent built with Plano that showcases all three core capabilities

&gt; 📁 **Full working code:** See [`demos/agent_orchestration/travel_agents/`](demos/agent_orchestration/travel_agents/) for complete weather and flight agents you can run locally.



### 1. Define Your Agents in YAML

```yaml
# config.yaml
version: v0.3.0

# What you declare: Agent URLs and natural language descriptions
# What you don&#039;t write: Intent classifiers, routing logic, model fallbacks, provider adapters, or tracing instrumentation

agents:
  - id: weather_agent
    url: http://localhost:10510
  - id: flight_agent
    url: http://localhost:10520

model_providers:
  - model: openai/gpt-4o
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    default: true
  - model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet
    access_key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

listeners:
  - type: agent
    name: travel_assistant
    port: 8001
    router: plano_orchestrator_v1  # Powered by our 4B-parameter routing model. You can change this to different models
    agents:
      - id: weather_agent
        description: |
          Gets real-time weather and forecasts for any city worldwide.
          Handles: &quot;What&#039;s the weather in Paris?&quot;, &quot;Will it rain in Tokyo?&quot;

      - id: flight_agent
        description: |
          Searches flights between airports with live status and schedules.
          Handles: &quot;Flights from NYC to LA&quot;, &quot;Show me flights to Seattle&quot;

tracing:
  random_sampling: 100  # Auto-capture traces for evaluation
```

### 2. Write Simple Agent Code

Your agents are just HTTP servers that implement the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint. Use any language or framework:

```python
# weather_agent.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

app = FastAPI()

# Point to Plano&#039;s LLM gateway - it handles model routing for you
llm = AsyncOpenAI(base_url=&quot;http://localhost:12001/v1&quot;, api_key=&quot;EMPTY&quot;)

@app.post(&quot;/v1/chat/completions&quot;)
async def chat(request: Request):
    body = await request.json()
    messages = body.get(&quot;messages&quot;, [])
    days = 7

    # Your agent logic: fetch data, call APIs, run tools
    # See demos/agent_orchestration/travel_agents/ for the full implementation
    weather_data = await get_weather_data(request, messages, days)

    # Stream the response back through Plano
    async def generate():
        stream = await llm.chat.completions.create(
            model=&quot;openai/gpt-4o&quot;,
            messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: f&quot;Weather: {weather_data}&quot;}, *messages],
            stream=True
        )
        async for chunk in stream:
            yield f&quot;data: {chunk.model_dump_json()}\n\n&quot;

    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type=&quot;text/event-stream&quot;)
```

### 3. Start Plano &amp; Query Your Agents

**Prerequisites:** Follow the [prerequisites guide](https://docs.planoai.dev/get_started/quickstart.html#prerequisites) to install Plano and set up your environment.

```bash
# Start Plano
planoai up config.yaml
...

# Query - Plano intelligently routes to both agents in a single conversation
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
      {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I want to travel from NYC to Paris next week. What is the weather like there, and can you find me some flights?&quot;}
    ]
  }&#039;
# → Plano routes to weather_agent for Paris weather ✓
# → Then routes to flight_agent for NYC → Paris flights ✓
# → Returns a complete travel plan with both weather info and flight options
```

### 4. Get Observability and Model Agility for Free

Every request is traced end-to-end with OpenTelemetry - no instrumentation code needed.

![Atomatic Tracing](docs/source/_static/img/demo_tracing.png)

### What You Didn&#039;t Have to Build

| Infrastructure Concern | Without Plano | With Plano |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Agent Orchestration** | Write intent classifier + routing logic | Declare agent descriptions in YAML |
| **Model Management** | Handle each provider&#039;s API quirks | Unified LLM APIs with state management |
| **Rich Tracing** | Instrument every service with OTEL | Automatic end-to-end traces and logs |
| **Learning Signals** | Build pipeline to capture/export spans | Zero-code agentic signals |
| **Adding Agents** | Update routing code, test, redeploy | Add to config, restart |

**Why it&#039;s efficient:** Plano uses purpose-built, lightweight LLMs (like our 4B-parameter orchestrator) instead of heavyweight frameworks or GPT-4 for routing - giving you production-grade routing at a fraction of the cost and latency.

&lt;br&gt;

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; The web-vault requires the use a secure context for the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API).
&gt; That means it will only work via `http://localhost:8000` (using the port from the example below) or if you [enable HTTPS](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS).

The recommended way to install and use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).
See [which container image to use](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Which-container-image-to-use) for an explanation of the provided tags.

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

Alternatively, you can also [build Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Building-binary) yourself.

While Vaultwarden is based upon the [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs) which has built-in support for TLS our recommendation would be that you setup a reverse proxy (see [proxy examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:8000:80
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

Vector is maintained by Datadog&#039;s [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.

&lt;hr /&gt;

Lance is an open lakehouse format for multimodal AI. It contains a file format, table format, and catalog spec that allows you to build a complete lakehouse on top of object storage to power your AI workflows. Lance is perfect for:

1. Building search engines and feature stores with hybrid search capabilities.
2. Large-scale ML training requiring high performance IO and random access.
3. Storing, querying, and managing multimodal data including images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings.

The key features of Lance include:

* **Expressive hybrid search:** Combine vector similarity search, full-text search (BM25), and SQL analytics on the same dataset with accelerated secondary indices.

* **Lightning-fast random access:** 100x faster than Parquet or Iceberg for random access without sacrificing scan performance.

* **Native multimodal data support:** Store images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings in a single unified format with efficient blob encoding and lazy loading.

* **Data evolution:** Efficiently add columns with backfilled values without full table rewrites, perfect for ML feature engineering.

* **Zero-copy versioning:** Automatic versioning with ACID transactions, time travel, tags, and branches—no extra infrastructure needed.

* **Rich ecosystem integrations:** Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Apache Spark, Ray, Trino, Apache Flink, and open catalogs (Apache Polaris, Unity Catalog, Apache Gravitino).

For more details, see the full [Lance format specification](https://lance.org/format).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Lance is in active development and we welcome contributions. Please see our [contributing guide](https://lance.org/community/contributing/) for more information.

## Quick Start

**Installation**

```shell
pip install pylance
```

To install a preview release:

```shell
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lance-format/pylance
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; For versions prior to 1.0.0-beta.4, you can find them at https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/pylance

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Preview releases are released more often than full releases and contain the
&gt; latest features and bug fixes. They receive the same level of testing as full releases.
&gt; We guarantee they will remain published and available for download for at
&gt; least 6 months. When you want to pin to a specific version, prefer a stable release.

**Converting to Lance**

```python
import lance

import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.dataset

df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;a&quot;: [5], &quot;b&quot;: [10]})
uri = &quot;/tmp/test.parquet&quot;
tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
pa.dataset.write_dataset(tbl, uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)

parquet = pa.dataset.dataset(uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)
lance.write_dataset(parquet, &quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
```

**Reading Lance data**
```python
dataset = lance.dataset(&quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
assert isinstance(dataset, pa.dataset.Dataset)
```

**Pandas**
```python
df = dataset.to_table().to_pandas()
df
```

**DuckDB**
```python
import duckdb

# If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM dataset LIMIT 10&quot;).to_df()
```

**Vector search**

Download the sift1m subset

```shell
wget ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz
tar -xzf sift.tar.gz
```

Convert it to Lance

```python
import lance
from lance.vector import vec_to_table
import numpy as np
import struct

nvecs = 1000000
ndims = 128
with open(&quot;sift/sift_base.fvecs&quot;, mode=&quot;rb&quot;) as fobj:
    buf = fobj.read()
    data = np.array(struct.unpack(&quot;&lt;128000000f&quot;, buf[4 : 4 + 4 * nvecs * ndims])).reshape((nvecs, ndims))
    dd = dict(zip(range(nvecs), data))

table = vec_to_table(dd)
uri = &quot;vec_data.lance&quot;
sift1m = lance.write_dataset(table, uri, max_rows_per_group=8192, max_rows_per_file=1024*1024)
```

Build the index

```python
sift1m.create_index(&quot;vector&quot;,
                    index_type=&quot;IVF_PQ&quot;,
                    num_partitions=256,  # IVF
                    num_sub_vectors=16)  # PQ
```

Search the dataset

```python
# Get top 10 similar vectors
import duckdb

dataset = lance.dataset(uri)

# Sample 100 query vectors. If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
sample = duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT vector FROM dataset USING SAMPLE 100&quot;).to_df()
query_vectors = np.array([np.array(x) for x in sample.vector])

# Get nearest neighbors for all of them
rs = [dataset.to_table(nearest={&quot;column&quot;: &quot;vector&quot;, &quot;k&quot;: 10, &quot;q&quot;: q})
      for q in query_vectors]
```

## Directory structure

| Directory          | Description              |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| [rust](./rust)     | Core Rust implementation |
| [python](./python) | Python bindings (PyO3)   |
| [java](./java)     | Java bindings (JNI)      |
| [docs](./docs)     | Documentation source     |

## Benchmarks

### Vector search

We used the SIFT dataset to benchmark our results with 1M vectors of 128D

1. For 100 randomly sampled query vectors, we get &lt;1ms average response time (on a 2023 m2 MacBook Air)

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/avg_latency.png)

2. ANNs are always a trade-off between recall and performance

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/recall_vs_latency.png)

### Vs. parquet

We create a Lance dataset using the Oxford Pet dataset to do some preliminary performance testing of Lance as compared to Parquet and raw image/XMLs. For analytics queries, Lance is 50-100x better than reading the raw metadata. For batched random access, Lance is 100x better than both parquet and raw files.

## Why Lance for AI/ML workflows?

The machine learning development cycle involves multiple stages:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --&gt; B[Exploration];
    B --&gt; C[Analytics];
    C --&gt; D[Feature Engineer];
    D --&gt; E[Training];
    E --&gt; F[Evaluation];
    F --&gt; C;
    E --&gt; G[Deployment];
    G --&gt; H[Monitoring];
    H --&gt; A;
```

Traditional lakehouse formats were designed for SQL analytics and struggle with AI/ML workloads that require:
- **Vector search** for similarity and semantic retrieval
- **Fast random access** for sampling and interactive exploration
- **Multimodal data** storage (images, videos, audio alongside embeddings)
- **Data evolution** for feature engineering without full table rewrites
- **Hybrid search** combining vectors, full-text, and SQL predicates

While existing formats (Parquet, Iceberg, Delta Lake) excel at SQL analytics, they require additional specialized systems for AI capabilities. Lance brings these AI-first features directly into the lakehouse format.

A comparison of different formats across ML development stages:

|                     | Lance | Parquet &amp; ORC | JSON &amp; XML | TFRecord | Database | Warehouse |
|---------------------|-------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Analytics           | Fast  | Fast          | Slow       | Slow     | Decent   | Fast      |
| Feature Engineering | Fast  | Fast          | Decent     | Slow     | Decent   | Good      |
| Training            | Fast  | Decent        | Slow       | Fast     | N/A      | N/A       |
| Exploration         | Fast  | Slow          | Fast       | Slow     | Fast     | Decent    |
| Infra Support       | Rich  | Rich          | Decent     | Limited  | Rich     | Rich      |

&lt;/p&gt;

- ⚡️ 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- 🐍 Installable via `pip`
- 🛠️ `pyproject.toml` support
- 🤝 Python 3.14 compatibility
- ⚖️ Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- 📏 Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ⌨️ First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors) for [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty).

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/23431#issuecomment-1302557034), lead developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) (also [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028)):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.15.4
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.10
target-version = &quot;py310&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 900 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), Ruff enables an expanded set of default rules
that includes rules from the `B`, `UP`, and `RUF` categories, as well as many more. If you give the
new defaults a try, feel free to leave feedback in the [GitHub
discussion](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/23203), where you can also find the new
rule set listed in full.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Servo Parallel Browser Engine Project

Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) language. It is currently developed on
64-bit macOS, 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows, 64-bit OpenHarmony, and Android.

Servo welcomes contribution from everyone. Check out:

- The [Servo Book](https://book.servo.org) for documentation
- [servo.org](https://servo.org/) for news and guides

Coordination of Servo development happens:
- Here in the Github Issues
- On the [Servo Zulip](https://servo.zulipchat.com/)
- In video calls advertised in the [Servo Project](https://github.com/servo/project/issues) repo.

RisingWave is an enterprise-grade event streaming platform designed to offer the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;simplest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;most cost-effective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; way to &lt;b&gt;ingest&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;process&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;manage&lt;/b&gt; real-time event data — with built-in support for the [Apache Iceberg™](https://iceberg.apache.org/) open table format. It provides both a Postgres-compatible [SQL interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) and a DataFrame-style [Python interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/python-sdk/intro).

RisingWave can &lt;b&gt;ingest&lt;/b&gt; millions of events per second, continuously &lt;b&gt;join and analyze&lt;/b&gt; live streams with historical data, &lt;b&gt;serve&lt;/b&gt; ad-hoc queries at low latency, and &lt;b&gt;manage&lt;/b&gt; data reliably in Apache Iceberg™ tables.

## Try it out in 60 seconds

Install RisingWave standalone mode:
```shell
curl -L https://risingwave.com/sh | sh
```

To learn about other installation options, such as using a Docker image, see the [quick start guide](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/quickstart).

## Unified platform for streaming data

RisingWave delivers a unified streaming data platform that combines **ultra-low-latency stream processing** and **Iceberg-native data management**.

### Low-latency streaming ingestion and processing
RisingWave integrates real-time streaming ingestion, stream processing and low-latency serving in a single system. It continuously ingests data from streaming and batch sources, performs incremental computations across streams and tables with end-to-end freshness under 100 ms. Materialized views can be served directly within RisingWave with 10–20 ms p99 query latency, or delivered to downstream systems.

### Iceberg lakehouse ingestion, transformation, and management
RisingWave treats Apache Iceberg™ as a first-class citizen. It directly hosts and manages the Iceberg REST catalog, allowing users to create and operate Iceberg tables through a PostgreSQL-compatible interface. RisingWave supports two write modes: Merge-on-Read (MoR) and Copy-on-Write (CoW), to suit different ingestion and query patterns. It also provides built-in table maintenance capabilities, including compaction, small-file optimization, vacuum, and snapshot cleanup, ensuring efficient and consistent data management without external tools or pipelines.

_Plug: [Nimtable](https://github.com/nimtable/nimtable) is an observability tool developed by RisingWave for easily exploring and managing Iceberg tables._



## Key design decisions

RisingWave is designed to be easier to use and more cost-efficient:

### PostgreSQL compatibility

* **Seamless integration:** Connects via the PostgreSQL wire protocol, working with psql, JDBC, and any Postgres tool.
* **Expressive SQL:** Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data with a familiar SQL dialect.
* **No manual state tuning:** Eliminates complex state management configurations.

### S3 as primary storage

RisingWave stores tables, materialized views, and internal states of stream processing jobs in S3 (or equivalent object storage), providing:
- **High performance:** Optimized for complex queries, including joins and time windowing.
- **Fast recovery:** Restores from system failures within seconds.
- **[Dynamic scaling](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/k8s-cluster-scaling):** Instantly adjusts resources to handle workload spikes.

Beyond caching hot data in memory, RisingWave supports [**elastic disk cache**](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/disk-cache), a powerful performance optimization that uses local disks or EBS for efficient data caching. This minimizes access to S3, lowering processing latency and cutting S3 access costs.

### Apache Iceberg™ native support
RisingWave [**natively integrates with Apache Iceberg™**](https://docs.risingwave.com/iceberg/overview), enabling continuous ingestion of streaming data into Iceberg tables. It can also read directly from Iceberg, perform automatic compaction, and maintain table health over time. Since Iceberg is an open table format, results are accessible by other query engines — making storage not only cost-efficient, but interoperable by design.

## In what use cases does RisingWave excel?
RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Live dashboards**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Monitoring and alerting**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.
* **Iceberg-based lakehouses**: Power real-time lakehouse architectures where streaming data is continuously written to Apache Iceberg™ tables for unified analytics, governance, and long-term retention in open formats.

## Polars: Extremely fast Query Engine for DataFrames, written in Rust

Polars is an analytical query engine written for DataFrames. It is designed to be fast, easy to use
and expressive. Key features are:

- Lazy | Eager execution
- Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Query optimization
- Multi-threaded
- Written in Rust
- SIMD
- Powerful expression API
- Front end in Python | Rust | NodeJS | R | SQL
- [Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Performance 🚀🚀

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming.

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

[offering](https://cloud.pola.rs/) and help the project!

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars[rt64]`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars[rtcompat]`. This version of
Polars is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target
features.

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

Who uses quiche?
----------------

### Cloudflare

quiche powers Cloudflare edge network&#039;s [HTTP/3 support][cloudflare-http3]. The
[cloudflare-quic.com](https://cloudflare-quic.com) website can be used for
testing and experimentation.

### Android

Android&#039;s DNS resolver uses quiche to [implement DNS over HTTP/3][android-http3].

### curl

quiche can be [integrated into curl][curl-http3] to provide support for HTTP/3.

[cloudflare-http3]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/
[android-http3]: https://security.googleblog.com/2022/07/dns-over-http3-in-android.html
[curl-http3]: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate. These are not
suitable for production environments; see [disclaimers and
notes](#disclaimers-and-notes).

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

[pace]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-7.7
[`SO_TXTIME`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-etf.8.html

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

[examples/]: quiche/examples/

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.85 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[BoringSSL]: https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[Android NDK]: https://developer.android.com/ndk
[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
- [cloudflare/quiche-qns](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche-qns)

The `latest` tag will be updated whenever quiche master branch updates.

**cloudflare/quiche**

Provides a server and client installed in /usr/local/bin.

**cloudflare/quiche-qns**

Provides the script to test quiche within the [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).

Disclaimers and Notes
---------

⚠️ This repository includes a number of client and server example
applications that are provided to demonstrate simple usage of the quiche library
API. They are not intended to be used in production environments; no
performance, security or reliability guarantees are provided.

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.
