&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the above snippet into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Provides an implementation of today&#039;s most used tokenizers, with a focus on performance and
versatility.

## Main features:

 - Train new vocabularies and tokenize, using today&#039;s most used tokenizers.
 - Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation. Takes
   less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server&#039;s CPU.
 - Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.
 - Designed for research and production.
 - Normalization comes with alignments tracking. It&#039;s always possible to get the part of the
   original sentence that corresponds to a given token.
 - Does all the pre-processing: Truncate, Pad, add the special tokens your model needs.

## Performances
Performances can vary depending on hardware, but running the [~/bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py](bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py) should give the following on a g6 aws instance:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b913d4b-e488-4cbc-b542-f90a6c40643d)


## Bindings

We provide bindings to the following languages (more to come!):
  - [Rust](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/tokenizers) (Original implementation)
  - [Python](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/python)
  - [Node.js](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/node)
  - [Ruby](https://github.com/ankane/tokenizers-ruby) (Contributed by @ankane, external repo)

## Installation

You can install from source using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers.git#subdirectory=bindings/python
```

our install the released versions with

```bash
pip install tokenizers
```
 
## Quick example using Python:

Choose your model between Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece or Unigram and instantiate a tokenizer:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE

tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())
```

You can customize how pre-tokenization (e.g., splitting into words) is done:

```python
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()
```

Then training your tokenizer on a set of files just takes two lines of codes:

```python
from tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer

trainer = BpeTrainer(special_tokens=[&quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;[CLS]&quot;, &quot;[SEP]&quot;, &quot;[PAD]&quot;, &quot;[MASK]&quot;])
tokenizer.train(files=[&quot;wiki.train.raw&quot;, &quot;wiki.valid.raw&quot;, &quot;wiki.test.raw&quot;], trainer=trainer)
```

Once your tokenizer is trained, encode any text with just one line:
```python
output = tokenizer.encode(&quot;Hello, y&#039;all! How are you 😁 ?&quot;)
print(output.tokens)
# [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;&#039;&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;How&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;?&quot;]
```

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is the open-source reactive database designed to
make life easy for web app developers, whether human or LLM. Fetch data and
perform business logic with strong consistency by writing pure TypeScript.

Convex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client
libraries. It makes it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.
[Read the docs to learn more](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/).

Development of the Convex backend is led by the Convex team. We
[welcome bug fixes](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[love receiving feedback](https://discord.gg/convex). We keep this repository
synced with any internal development work within a handful of days.

## Getting Started

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/) to learn more about Convex
and follow our getting started guides.

The easiest way to build with Convex is through our
[cloud platform](https://www.convex.dev/plans), which includes a generous free
tier and lets you focus on building your application without worrying about
infrastructure. Many small applications and side-projects can operate entirely
on the free tier with zero cost and zero maintenance.

## Self Hosting

The self-hosted product includes most features of the cloud product, including
the dashboard and CLI. Self-hosted Convex works well with a variety of tools
including Neon, Fly.io, Vercel, Netlify, RDS, Sqlite, Postgres, and more.

You can either use Docker (recommended) or a prebuilt binary to self host
Convex. Check out our [self-hosting guide](./self-hosted/README.md) for detailed
instructions. Community support for self-hosting is available in the
`#self-hosted` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/convex).

## Community &amp; Support

- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/convex) for help and
  discussions.
- Report issues when building and using the open source Convex backend through
  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend/issues)

## Building from source

See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md).

## Disclaimers

- If you choose to self-host, we recommend following the self-hosting guide. If
  you are instead building from source, make sure to change your instance secret
  and admin key from the defaults in the repo.
- Convex is battle tested most thoroughly on Linux and Mac. On Windows, it has
  less experience. If you run into issues, please message us on
  [Discord](https://convex.dev/community) in the `#self-hosted` channel.
- Convex self-hosted builds contain a beacon to help Convex improve the improve
  the product. The information is minimal and anonymous and helpful to Convex,
  but if you really want to disable it, you can set the `--disable-beacon` flag
  on the backend binary. The beacon&#039;s messages print in the log and only include
  - A random identifier for your deployment (not used elsewhere)
  - Migration version of your database
  - Git rev of the backend
  - Uptime of the backend

## Repository layout

- `crates/` contains Rust code

  - Main binary
    - `local_backend/` is an application server on top of the `Runtime`. This is
      the serving edge for the Convex cloud.

- `npm-packages/` contains both our public and internal TypeScript packages.
  - Internal packages
    - `udf-runtime/` sets up the user-defined functions JS environment for
      queries and mutations
    - `udf-tests/` is a collection of functions used in testing the isolate
      layer
    - `system-udfs/` contains functions used by the Convex system e.g. the CLI

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Platform support

See uv&#039;s [platform support](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/platforms/) document.

## Versioning policy

See uv&#039;s [versioning policy](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/versioning/) document.

## Contributing

We are passionate about supporting contributors of all levels of experience and would love to see
you get involved in the project. See the
[contributing guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

&lt;div&gt;

### 1. Install platform dependencies

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config jq dpkg curl wget cmake clang libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libdbus-1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev valac libibus-1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev sqlite3 libxdo-dev protobuf-compiler
```
### 2. Install Rust toolchain using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs):

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

For pre-commit hooks, the following commands are required:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install typos-cli
```

For MacOS development make sure the right targets are installed:

```shell
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Setup Python and Node using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Add mise integrations to your shell:

For zsh:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; &quot;${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc&quot;
```

For bash:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
```

```shell
echo &#039;mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Install the Python and Node toolchains using:

```shell
mise trust
mise install
```

### 4. Setup precommit hooks

Run `pnpm` in root directory to add pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;


### 3. Start Local Development
To compile and view changes made to `q chat`:
```shell
cargo run --bin q_cli -- chat
```

&gt; If you are working on other q commands, just replace `chat` with the command name 

To run tests for the Q CLI crate:
```shell
cargo test -p q_cli
```

To format Rust files:
```shell
cargo +nightly fmt
```

To run clippy:
```shell
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --color always -- -D warnings
```



### 💡 Quick Tip for Onboarding

Use Q CLI to help you onboard Q CLI! 

Start a `q chat` session:

```shell
q chat
```

Once inside `q chat`, you can supply project context by adding the [`codebase-summary.md`](codebase-summary.md) file:

```shell
/context add codebase-summary.md
```

This enables Q to answer onboarding questions like:

- “What does this crate do?”

- “Where is X implemented?”

- “How do these components interact?”

Great for speeding up your ramp-up and navigating the repo more effectively.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Embassy

Embassy is the next-generation framework for embedded applications. Write safe, correct and energy-efficient embedded code faster, using the Rust programming language, its async facilities, and the Embassy libraries.

## &lt;a href=&quot;https://embassy.dev/book/index.html&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/&quot;&gt;API reference&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://embassy.dev/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.to/#/#embassy-rs:matrix.org&quot;&gt;Chat&lt;/a&gt;
## Rust + async ❤️ embedded

The Rust programming language is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime, garbage collector or OS. It catches a wide variety of bugs at compile time, thanks to its full memory- and thread-safety, and expressive type system. 

Rust&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/&quot;&gt;async/await&lt;/a&gt; allows for unprecedentedly easy and efficient multitasking in embedded systems. Tasks get transformed at compile time into state machines that get run cooperatively. It requires no dynamic memory allocation, and runs on a single stack,  so no per-task stack size tuning is required. It obsoletes the need for a traditional RTOS with kernel context switching, and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown&quot;&gt;faster and smaller than one!&lt;/a&gt;

## Batteries included

- **Hardware Abstraction Layers** - HALs implement safe, idiomatic Rust APIs to use the hardware capabilities, so raw register manipulation is not needed. The Embassy project maintains HALs for select hardware, but you can still use HALs from other projects with Embassy.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/&quot;&gt;embassy-stm32&lt;/a&gt;, for all STM32 microcontroller families.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-nrf/&quot;&gt;embassy-nrf&lt;/a&gt;, for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF54 and nRF91 series.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/&quot;&gt;embassy-rp&lt;/a&gt;, for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP23xx microcontrollers.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-mspm0/&quot;&gt;embassy-mspm0&lt;/a&gt;, for the Texas Instruments MSPM0 microcontrollers.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/esp-rs&quot;&gt;esp-rs&lt;/a&gt;, for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of chips.
    - Embassy HAL support for Espressif chips, as well as Async WiFi, Bluetooth and ESP-NOW,  is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repository.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal&quot;&gt;ch32-hal&lt;/a&gt;, for the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series of chips.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AlexCharlton/mpfs-hal&quot;&gt;mpfs-hal&lt;/a&gt;, for the Microchip PolarFire SoC.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-hal&quot;&gt;py32-hal&lt;/a&gt;, for the Puya Semiconductor PY32 series of microcontrollers.

- **Time that Just Works** - 
No more messing with hardware timers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time&quot;&gt;embassy_time&lt;/a&gt; provides Instant, Duration and Timer types that are globally available and never overflow.

- **Real-time ready** - 
Tasks on the same async executor run cooperatively, but you can create multiple executors with different priorities, so that higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/master/examples/nrf52840/src/bin/multiprio.rs&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.

- **Low-power ready** - 
Easily build devices with years of battery life. The async executor automatically puts the core to sleep when there&#039;s no work to do. Tasks are woken by interrupts, there is no busy-loop polling while waiting.
 
- **Networking** - 
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/&quot;&gt;embassy-net&lt;/a&gt; network stack implements extensive networking functionality, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP and DHCP. Async drastically simplifies managing timeouts and serving multiple connections concurrently.

- **Bluetooth**
  - The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble&quot;&gt;trouble&lt;/a&gt; crate provides a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x Host that runs on any microcontroller implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/bt-hci&quot;&gt;bt-hci&lt;/a&gt; traits (currently `nRF52`, `rp2040`, `rp23xx` and `esp32` and `serial` controllers are supported).
  - The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice&quot;&gt;nrf-softdevice&lt;/a&gt; crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x support for nRF52 microcontrollers.
  - The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-stm32-wpan&quot;&gt;embassy-stm32-wpan&lt;/a&gt; crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 5.x support for stm32wb microcontrollers.

- **LoRa** - The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs&quot;&gt;lora-rs&lt;/a&gt; project provides an async LoRa and LoRaWAN stack that works well on Embassy.

- **USB** - 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-usb/&quot;&gt;embassy-usb&lt;/a&gt; implements a device-side USB stack. Implementations for common classes such as USB serial (CDC ACM) and USB HID are available, and a rich builder API allows building your own.

- **Bootloader and DFU** - 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/master/embassy-boot&quot;&gt;embassy-boot&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks.


## Sneak peek

```rust,ignore
use defmt::info;
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_time::{Duration, Timer};
use embassy_nrf::gpio::{AnyPin, Input, Level, Output, OutputDrive, Pin, Pull};
use embassy_nrf::{Peri, Peripherals};

// Declare async tasks
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn blink(pin: Peri&lt;&#039;static, AnyPin&gt;) {
    let mut led = Output::new(pin, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard);

    loop {
        // Timekeeping is globally available, no need to mess with hardware timers.
        led.set_high();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
        led.set_low();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
    }
}

// Main is itself an async task as well.
#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());

    // Spawned tasks run in the background, concurrently.
    spawner.spawn(blink(p.P0_13.into())).unwrap();

    let mut button = Input::new(p.P0_11, Pull::Up);
    loop {
        // Asynchronously wait for GPIO events, allowing other tasks
        // to run, or the core to sleep.
        button.wait_for_low().await;
        info!(&quot;Button pressed!&quot;);
        button.wait_for_high().await;
        info!(&quot;Button released!&quot;);
    }
}
```

## Examples

Examples are found in the `examples/` folder separated by the chip manufacturer they are designed to run on. For example:

*   `examples/nrf52840` run on the `nrf52840-dk` board (PCA10056) but should be easily adaptable to other nRF52 chips and boards.
*   `examples/nrf5340` run on the `nrf5340-dk` board (PCA10095).
*   `examples/stm32xx` for the various STM32 families.
*   `examples/rp` are for the RP2040 chip.
*   `examples/std` are designed to run locally on your PC.

### Running examples

- Install `probe-rs` following the instructions at &lt;https://probe.rs&gt;.
- Change directory to the sample&#039;s base directory. For example:

```bash
cd examples/nrf52840
```

- Ensure `Cargo.toml` sets the right feature for the name of the chip you are programming.
  If this name is incorrect, the example may fail to run or immediately crash
  after being programmed.

- Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` contains the name of the chip you are programming.

- Run the example

For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin blinky
```

For more help getting started, see [Getting Started][1] and [Running the Examples][2].

## Developing Embassy with Rust Analyzer based editors

The [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is used by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and others. Given the multiple targets that Embassy serves, there is no Cargo workspace file. Instead, the Rust Analyzer
must be told of the target project to work with. In the case of Visual Studio Code,
please refer to the `.vscode/settings.json` file&#039;s `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects`setting.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

Embassy is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.75 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

## Why the name?

EMBedded ASYnc! :)

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

Who uses quiche?
----------------

### Cloudflare

quiche powers Cloudflare edge network&#039;s [HTTP/3 support][cloudflare-http3]. The
[cloudflare-quic.com](https://cloudflare-quic.com) website can be used for
testing and experimentation.

### Android

Android&#039;s DNS resolver uses quiche to [implement DNS over HTTP/3][android-http3].

### curl

quiche can be [integrated into curl][curl-http3] to provide support for HTTP/3.

[cloudflare-http3]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/
[android-http3]: https://security.googleblog.com/2022/07/dns-over-http3-in-android.html
[curl-http3]: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate.

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

[examples/]: quiche/examples/

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.81 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[BoringSSL]: https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
- [cloudflare/quiche-qns](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche-qns)

The `latest` tag will be updated whenever quiche master branch updates.

**cloudflare/quiche**

Provides a server and client installed in /usr/local/bin.

**cloudflare/quiche-qns**

Provides the script to test quiche within the [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).

Rustls is a modern TLS library written in Rust.
&lt;/p&gt;

# Status

Rustls is used in production at many organizations and projects. We aim to maintain
reasonable API surface stability but the API may evolve as we make changes to accommodate
new features or performance improvements.

We have a [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for our future plans. We also have [benchmarks](BENCHMARKING.md) to
prevent performance regressions and to let you evaluate rustls on your target hardware.

If you&#039;d like to help out, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Changelog

The detailed list of changes in each release can be found at
https://github.com/rustls/rustls/releases.

# Documentation

https://docs.rs/rustls/

# Approach

Rustls is a TLS library that aims to provide a good level of cryptographic security,
requires no configuration to achieve that security, and provides no unsafe features or
obsolete cryptography by default.

Rustls implements TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 for both clients and servers. See [the full
list of protocol features](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/manual/_04_features/index.html).

### Platform support

While Rustls itself is platform independent, by default it uses [`aws-lc-rs`] for implementing
the cryptography in TLS.  See [the aws-lc-rs FAQ][aws-lc-rs-platforms-faq] for more details of the
platform/architecture support constraints in aws-lc-rs.

[`ring`] is also available via the `ring` crate feature: see
[the supported `ring` target platforms][ring-target-platforms].

By providing a custom instance of the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] struct, you
can replace all cryptography dependencies of rustls.  This is a route to being portable
to a wider set of architectures and environments, or compliance requirements.  See the
[`crypto::CryptoProvider`] documentation for more details.

Specifying `default-features = false` when depending on rustls will remove the implicit
dependency on aws-lc-rs.

Rustls requires Rust 1.71 or later. It has an optional dependency on zlib-rs which requires 1.75 or later.

[`aws-lc-rs`]: https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs

### Cryptography providers

Since Rustls 0.22 it has been possible to choose the provider of the cryptographic primitives
that Rustls uses. This may be appealing if you have specific platform, compliance or feature
requirements that aren&#039;t met by the default provider, [`aws-lc-rs`].

Users that wish to customize the provider in use can do so when constructing `ClientConfig`
and `ServerConfig` instances using the `with_crypto_provider` method on the respective config
builder types. See the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] documentation for more details.

#### Built-in providers

Rustls ships with two built-in providers controlled by associated crate features:

* [`aws-lc-rs`] - enabled by default, available with the `aws_lc_rs` crate feature enabled.
* [`ring`] - available with the `ring` crate feature enabled.

See the documentation for [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] for details on how providers are
selected.

#### Third-party providers

The community has also started developing third-party providers for Rustls:

* [`rustls-mbedtls-provider`] - a provider that uses [`mbedtls`] for cryptography.
* [`rustls-openssl`] - a provider that uses [OpenSSL] for cryptography.
* [`boring-rustls-provider`] - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`boringssl`] for
cryptography.
* [`rustls-rustcrypto`] - an experimental provider that uses the crypto primitives
from [`RustCrypto`] for cryptography.
* [`rustls-symcrypt`] - a provider that uses Microsoft&#039;s [SymCrypt] library.
* [`rustls-wolfcrypt-provider`] - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`wolfCrypt`] for cryptography.

#### Custom provider

We also provide a simple example of writing your own provider in the [custom provider example].
This example implements a minimal provider using parts of the [`RustCrypto`] ecosystem.

See the [Making a custom CryptoProvider] section of the documentation for more information
on this topic.

# Example code

Our [examples] directory contains demos that show how to handle I/O using the
[`stream::Stream`] helper, as well as more complex asynchronous I/O using [`mio`].
If you&#039;re already using Tokio for an async runtime you may prefer to use
[`tokio-rustls`] instead of interacting with rustls directly.

The [`mio`] based examples are the most complete, and discussed below. Users
new to Rustls may prefer to look at the simple client/server examples before
diving in to the more complex MIO examples.

[examples]: examples/
[`stream::Stream`]: https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/struct.Stream.html
[`mio`]: https://docs.rs/mio/latest/mio/
[`tokio-rustls`]: https://docs.rs/tokio-rustls/latest/tokio_rustls/

## Client example program

The MIO client example program is named `tlsclient-mio`.

Some sample runs:

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --http mozilla-modern.badssl.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.6.2 (Ubuntu)
Date: Wed, 01 Jun 2016 18:44:00 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 644
(...)
```

or

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --http expired.badssl.com
TLS error: InvalidCertificate(Expired)
Connection closed
```

Run `cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --help` for more options.

## Server example program

The MIO server example program is named `tlsserver-mio`.

Here&#039;s a sample run; we start a TLS echo server, then connect to it with
`openssl` and `tlsclient-mio`:

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsserver-mio -- --certs test-ca/rsa-2048/end.fullchain --key test-ca/rsa-2048/end.key -p 8443 echo &amp;
$ echo hello world | openssl s_client -ign_eof -quiet -connect localhost:8443
depth=2 CN = ponytown RSA CA
verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain
hello world
^C
$ echo hello world | cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --cafile test-ca/rsa-2048/ca.cert --port 8443 localhost
hello world
^C
```

Run `cargo run --bin tlsserver-mio -- --help` for more options.

&lt;br&gt;

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like `Cannot read property &#039;importKey&#039;`. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.
&gt;
&gt;This can be configured in [Vaultwarden directly](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS) or using a third-party reverse proxy ([some examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).
&gt;
&gt;If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with [Let&#039;s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Some proxies automatically do this step, like Caddy or Traefik (see examples linked above).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

The main way to use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 80:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 80:80
```

# Pixi: Package Management Made Easy

## Overview

`pixi` is a cross-platform, multi-language package manager and workflow tool built on the foundation of the conda ecosystem. It provides developers with an exceptional experience similar to popular package managers like `cargo` or `yarn`, but for any language.

Developed with ❤️ at [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).
[![Real-time pixi_demo](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/assets/12893423/0fc8f8c8-ac13-4c14-891b-dc613f25475b)](https://asciinema.org/a/636482)

## Highlights

- Supports **multiple languages** including Python, C++, and R using Conda packages. You can find available packages on [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).
- Compatible with all major operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS (including Apple Silicon).
- Always includes an up-to-date **lock file**.
- Provides a clean and simple Cargo-like **command-line interface**.
- Allows you to install tools **per-project** or **system-wide**.
- Entirely written in **Rust** and built on top of the **[rattler](https://github.com/conda/rattler)** library.

## Getting Started

- ⚡ [Installation](#installation)
- ⚙️ [Examples](/examples)
- 📚 [Documentation](https://pixi.sh/)
- 😍 [Contributing](#contributing)
- 🔨 [Built using Pixi](#built-using-pixi)
- 🚀 [GitHub Action](https://github.com/prefix-dev/setup-pixi)

## Status

Pixi is ready for production!
We are working hard to keep file-format changes compatible with the previous
versions so that you can rely on Pixi with peace of mind.

Some notable features we envision for upcoming releases are:

- **Build and publish** your project as a Conda package.
- Support for **dependencies from source**.
- More powerful &quot;global installation&quot; of packages towards a deterministic setup of global packages on multiple machines.

## Installation

`pixi` can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The provided scripts will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `~/.pixi/bin`. If this directory does not exist, the script will create it.

### macOS and Linux

To install Pixi on macOS and Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
# or with brew
brew install pixi
```

The script will also update your `~/.bashrc` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your `PATH`, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.
You might need to restart your terminal or source your shell for the changes to take effect.

Starting with macOS Catalina [zsh is the default login shell and interactive shell](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102360). Therefore, you might want to use `zsh` instead of `bash` in the install command:

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | zsh
```

The script will also update your `~/.zshrc` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your `PATH`, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.

### Windows

To install Pixi on Windows, open a PowerShell terminal (you may need to run it as an administrator) and run the following command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```
Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.
Check the script you would be running with:
```powershell
powershell -c &quot;irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | more&quot;
```

The script will inform you once the installation is successful and add the `~/.pixi/bin` directory to your `PATH`, which will allow you to run the `pixi` command from any location.
Or with `winget`

```shell
winget install prefix-dev.pixi
```

### Autocompletion

To get autocompletion follow the instructions for your shell.
Afterwards, restart the shell or source the shell config file.

#### Bash (default on most Linux systems)

Add the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

eval &quot;$(pixi completion --shell bash)&quot;
```
#### Zsh (default on macOS)

Add the following to the end of `~/.zshrc`:


```zsh
# ~/.zshrc

eval &quot;$(pixi completion --shell zsh)&quot;
```

#### PowerShell (pre-installed on all Windows systems)

Add the following to the end of `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.
You can check the location of this file by querying the `$PROFILE` variable in PowerShell.
Typically the path is `~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` or
`~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` on -Nix.

```pwsh
(&amp; pixi completion --shell powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

#### Fish

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

pixi completion --shell fish | source
```

#### Nushell

Add the following to your Nushell config file (find it by running `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):

```nushell
mkdir $&quot;($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload&quot;
pixi completion --shell nushell | save --force $&quot;($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload/pixi-completions.nu&quot;
```

#### Elvish

Add the following to the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:

```elv
# ~/.elvish/rc.elv

eval (pixi completion --shell elvish | slurp)
```

### Distro Packages

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pixi.svg)](https://repology.org/project/pixi/versions)

#### Arch Linux

You can install `pixi` from the [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pixi/) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):

```shell
pacman -S pixi
```

#### Alpine Linux

`pixi` is available for [Alpine Edge](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=pixi&amp;branch=edge). It can be installed via [apk](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Package_Keeper) after enabling the [testing repository](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories).

```shell
apk add pixi
```

## Build/install from source

`pixi` is 100% written in Rust and therefore it can be installed, built and tested with cargo.
To start using `pixi` from a source build run:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git pixi
```

We don&#039;t publish to `crates.io` anymore, so you need to install it from the repository.
The reason for this is that we depend on some unpublished crates which disallows us to publish to `crates.io`.

or when you want to make changes use:

```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

If you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout
it&#039;s [compile steps](https://github.com/conda/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)

## Uninstall

To uninstall, the Pixi binary should be removed.
Delete `pixi` from the `$PIXI_DIR` which is default to `~/.pixi/bin/pixi`

So on Linux its:

```shell
rm ~/.pixi/bin/pixi
```

and on Windows:

```shell
$PIXI_BIN = &quot;$Env:LocalAppData\pixi\bin\pixi&quot;; Remove-Item -Path $PIXI_BIN
```

After this command you can still use the tools you installed with `pixi`.
To remove these as well just remove the whole `~/.pixi` directory and remove the directory from your path.

# Usage

The cli looks as follows:

```bash
➜ pixi
A package management and workflow tool

Usage: pixi [OPTIONS] &lt;COMMAND&gt;

Commands:
  completion  Generates a completion script for a shell
  init        Creates a new project
  add         Adds a dependency to the project
  run         Runs task in project
  shell       Start a shell in the pixi environment of the project
  global      Global is the main entry point for the part of pixi that executes on the global(system) level
  auth        Login to prefix.dev or anaconda.org servers to access private channels
  install     Install all dependencies
  task        Command management in project
  info        Information about the system and project

  -h, --help           Print help
  -V, --version        Print version

```

## Creating a Pixi project

Initialize a new project and navigate to the project directory

```
pixi init myproject
cd myproject
```

Add the dependencies you want to use

```
pixi add cowpy
```

Run the installed package in its environment

```bash
pixi run cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
```

Activate a shell in the environment

```shell
pixi shell
cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
exit
```

## Installing a conda package globally

You can also globally install conda packages into their own environment.
This behavior is similar to [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) or [`condax`](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk/condax).

```bash
pixi global install cowpy
```

## Use in GitHub Actions

You can use Pixi in GitHub Actions to install dependencies and run commands.
It supports automatic caching of your environments.

```yml
- uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
- run: pixi exec cowpy &quot;Thanks for using pixi&quot;
```

See the [documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/advanced/github_actions) for more details.

_komorebi_ is a tiling window manager that works as an extension to Microsoft&#039;s
[Desktop Window
Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dwm/dwm-overview) in
Windows 10 and above.

_komorebi_ allows you to control application windows, virtual workspaces and display monitors with a CLI which can be
used with third-party software such as [`whkd`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/whkd)
and [AutoHotKey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) to set user-defined keyboard shortcuts.

_komorebi_ aims to make _as few modifications as possible_ to the operating
system and desktop environment by default. Users are free to make such
modifications in their own configuration files for _komorebi_, but these will
remain opt-in and off-by-default for the foreseeable future.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi) for instructions on how
to [install](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/installation.html) and
[configure](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/example-configurations.html)
_komorebi_, [common workflows](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/common-workflows/komorebi-config-home.html), a complete
[configuration schema reference](https://komorebi.lgug2z.com/schema) and a
complete [CLI reference](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/cli/quickstart.html).

## Community

There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mGkn66PHkx) available for
_komorebi_-related discussion, help, troubleshooting etc. If you have any
specific feature requests or bugs to report, please create an issue in this
repository.

There is a [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeai3-do-9O4MNy9_xjO6mg) where I post
_komorebi_ development videos, feature previews and release overviews. Subscribing
to the channel (which is monetized as part of the YouTube Partner Program) and
watching videos is a really simple and passive way to contribute financially to
the development and maintenance of _komorebi_.

There is an [Awesome List](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/awesome-komorebi) which
showcases the many awesome projects that exist in the _komorebi_ ecosystem.

# Comparison With Fancy Zones

Community member [Olge](https://www.youtube.com/@polle5555) has created an
excellent video which compares the default window management features of
Windows 11, Fancy Zones and komorebi.

If you are not familiar with tiling window managers or if you are looking at
komorebi and wondering &quot;how is this different from Fancy Zones? 🤔&quot;, this short
video will answer the majority of your questions.

# Contribution Guidelines

If you would like to contribute to `komorebi` please take the time to carefully
read the guidelines below.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about how
code contributions to `komorebi` are licensed.

## Commit hygiene

- Flatten all `use` statements
- Run `cargo +stable clippy` and ensure that all lints and suggestions have been addressed before committing
- Run `cargo +nightly fmt --all` to ensure consistent formatting before committing
- Use `git cz` with
  the [Commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#conventional-commit-messages-as-a-global-utility) to prepare
  commit messages
- Provide **at least** one short sentence or paragraph in your commit message body to describe your thought process for
  the changes being committed

## PRs should contain only a single feature or bug fix

It is very difficult to review pull requests which touch multiple unrelated features and parts of the codebase.

Please do not submit pull requests like this; you will be asked to separate them into smaller PRs that deal only with
one feature or bug fix at a time.

If you are working on multiple features and bug fixes, I suggest that you cut a branch called `local-trunk`
from `master` which you keep up to date, and rebase the various independent branches you are working on onto that branch
if you want to test them together or create a build with everything integrated.

## Refactors to the codebase must have prior approval

`komorebi` is a mature codebase with an internal consistency and structure that has developed organically over close to
half a decade.

There are [countless hours of live coding videos](https://youtube.com/@LGUG2Z) demonstrating work on this project and
showing new contributors how to do everything from basic tasks like implementing new `komorebic` commands to
distinguishing monitors by manufacturer hardware identifiers and video card ports.

Refactors to the structure of the codebase are not taken lightly and require prior discussion and approval.

Please do not start refactoring the codebase with the expectation of having your changes integrated until you receive an
explicit approval or a request to do so.

Similarly, when implementing features and bug fixes, please stick to the structure of the codebase as much as possible
and do not take this as an opportunity to do some &quot;refactoring along the way&quot;.

It is extremely difficult to review PRs for features and bug fixes if they are lost in sweeping changes to the structure
of the codebase.

## Breaking changes to user-facing interfaces are unacceptable

This includes but is not limited to:

- All `komorebic` commands
- The `komorebi.json` schema
- The [
  `komorebi-application-specific-configuration`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-application-specific-configuration)
  schema

No user should ever find that their configuration file has stopped working after upgrading to a new version
of `komorebi`.

More often than not there are ways to reformulate changes that may initially seem like they require breaking user-facing
interfaces into additive changes.

For some inspiration please take a look
at [this commit](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/e7d928a065eb63bb4ea1fb864c69c1cae8cc763b) which added the
ability for users to specify colours in `komorebi.json` in Hex format alongside RGB.

There is also a process in place for graceful, non-breaking, deprecation of configuration options that are no longer
required.

# Development

If you use IntelliJ, you should enable the following settings to ensure that code generated by macros is recognised by
the IDE for completions and navigation:

- Set `Expand declarative macros`
  to `Use new engine` under &quot;Settings &gt; Langauges &amp; Frameworks &gt; Rust&quot;
- Enable the following experimental features:
    - `org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts`
    - `org.rust.macros.proc`

# Logs and Debugging

Logs from `komorebi` will be appended to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/komorebi/komorebi.log`; this file is never rotated or
overwritten, so it will keep growing until it is deleted by the user.

Whenever running the `komorebic stop` command or sending a Ctrl-C signal to `komorebi` directly, the `komorebi` process
ensures that all hidden windows are restored before termination.

If however, you ever end up with windows that are hidden and cannot be restored, a list of window handles known
to `komorebi` are stored and continuously updated in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/komorebi//komorebi.hwnd.json`.

## Restoring Windows

Running `komorebic restore-windows` will read the list of window handles and forcibly restore them, regardless of
whether the main `komorebi` process is running.

## Panics and Deadlocks

If `komorebi` ever stops responding, it is most likely either due to either a panic or a deadlock. In the case of a
panic, this will be reported in the log. In the case of a deadlock, there will not be any errors in the log, but the
process and the log will appear frozen.

If you believe you have encountered a deadlock, you can compile `komorebi` with `--features deadlock_detection` and try
reproducing the deadlock again. This will check for deadlocks every 5 seconds in the background, and if a deadlock is
found, information about it will appear in the log which can be shared when opening an issue.

# Window Manager State and Integrations

The current state of the window manager can be queried using the `komorebic state` command, which returns a JSON
representation of the `State` struct.

This may also be polled to build further integrations and widgets on top of.

# Window Manager Event Subscriptions

## Named Pipes

It is possible to subscribe to notifications of every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled
by `komorebi` using [Named Pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes).

First, your application must create a named pipe. Once the named pipe has been created, run the following command:

```powershell
komorebic.exe subscribe-pipe &lt;your pipe name&gt;
```

Note that you do not have to include the full path of the named pipe, just the name.

If the named pipe exists, `komorebi` will start pushing JSON data of successfully handled events and messages:

```json lines
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;AddSubscriber&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;yasb&quot;},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusWindow&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Left&quot;},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusChange&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;SystemForeground&quot;,{&quot;hwnd&quot;:131444,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;komorebi – README.md&quot;,&quot;exe&quot;:&quot;idea64.exe&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;SunAwtFrame&quot;,&quot;rect&quot;:{&quot;left&quot;:13,&quot;top&quot;:60,&quot;right&quot;:1520,&quot;bottom&quot;:1655}}]},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;MonitorPoll&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;ObjectCreate&quot;,{&quot;hwnd&quot;:5572450,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;OLEChannelWnd&quot;,&quot;exe&quot;:&quot;explorer.exe&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;OleMainThreadWndClass&quot;,&quot;rect&quot;:{&quot;left&quot;:0,&quot;top&quot;:0,&quot;right&quot;:0,&quot;bottom&quot;:0}}]},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusWindow&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Right&quot;},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusChange&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;SystemForeground&quot;,{&quot;hwnd&quot;:132968,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Windows PowerShell&quot;,&quot;exe&quot;:&quot;WindowsTerminal.exe&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS&quot;,&quot;rect&quot;:{&quot;left&quot;:1539,&quot;top&quot;:60,&quot;right&quot;:1520,&quot;bottom&quot;:821}}]},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusWindow&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Down&quot;},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusChange&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;SystemForeground&quot;,{&quot;hwnd&quot;:329264,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;den — Mozilla Firefox&quot;,&quot;exe&quot;:&quot;firefox.exe&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;MozillaWindowClass&quot;,&quot;rect&quot;:{&quot;left&quot;:1539,&quot;top&quot;:894,&quot;right&quot;:1520,&quot;bottom&quot;:821}}]},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusWindow&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Up&quot;},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusChange&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;SystemForeground&quot;,{&quot;hwnd&quot;:132968,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Windows PowerShell&quot;,&quot;exe&quot;:&quot;WindowsTerminal.exe&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS&quot;,&quot;rect&quot;:{&quot;left&quot;:1539,&quot;top&quot;:60,&quot;right&quot;:1520,&quot;bottom&quot;:821}}]},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
```

You may then filter on the `type` key to listen to the events that you are interested in. For a full list of possible
notification types, refer to the enum variants of `WindowManagerEvent` in `komorebi` and `SocketMessage`
in `komorebi::core`.

Below is an example of how you can subscribe to and filter on events using a named pipe in `nodejs`.

```javascript
const { exec } = require(&quot;child_process&quot;);
const net = require(&quot;net&quot;);

const pipeName = &quot;\\\\.\\pipe\\komorebi-js&quot;;
const server = net.createServer((stream) =&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;Client connected&quot;);

  // Every time there is a workspace-related event, let&#039;s log the names of all
  // workspaces on the currently focused monitor, and then log the name of the
  // currently focused workspace on that monitor

  stream.on(&quot;data&quot;, (data) =&gt; {
    let json = JSON.parse(data.toString());
    let event = json.event;

    if (event.type.includes(&quot;Workspace&quot;)) {
      let monitors = json.state.monitors;
      let current_monitor = monitors.elements[monitors.focused];
      let workspaces = monitors.elements[monitors.focused].workspaces;
      let current_workspace = workspaces.elements[workspaces.focused];

      console.log(
        workspaces.elements
          .map((workspace) =&gt; workspace.name)
          .filter((name) =&gt; name !== null)
      );
      console.log(current_workspace.name);
    }
  });

  stream.on(&quot;end&quot;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(&quot;Client disconnected&quot;);
  });
});

server.listen(pipeName, () =&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;Named pipe server listening&quot;);
});

const command = &quot;komorebic subscribe-pipe komorebi-js&quot;;

exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) =&gt; {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error executing command: ${error}`);
    return;
  }
});
```

## Unix Domain Sockets

It is possible to subscribe to notifications of every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled
by `komorebi` using [Unix Domain Sockets](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/).

UDS are also the only mode of communication between `komorebi` and `komorebic`.

First, your application must create a socket in `$ENV:LocalAppData\komorebi`. Once the socket has been created, run the
following command:

```powershell
komorebic.exe subscribe-socket &lt;your socket name&gt;
```

If the socket exists, komorebi will start pushing JSON data of successfully handled events and messages as in the
example above in the Named Pipes section.

## Rust Client

As of `v0.1.22` it is possible to use the `komorebi-client` crate to subscribe to notifications of
every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled by `komorebi` in a Rust codebase.

Below is a simple example of how to use `komorebi-client` in a basic Rust application.

```rust
// komorebi-client = { git = &quot;https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi&quot;, tag = &quot;v0.1.35&quot;}

use anyhow::Result;
use komorebi_client::Notification;
use komorebi_client::NotificationEvent;
use komorebi_client::UnixListener;
use komorebi_client::WindowManagerEvent;
use std::io::BufRead;
use std::io::BufReader;
use std::io::Read;

pub fn main() -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {
  let socket = komorebi_client::subscribe(NAME)?;

  for incoming in socket.incoming() {
    match incoming {
      Ok(data) =&gt; {
        let reader = BufReader::new(data.try_clone()?);

        for line in reader.lines().flatten() {
          let notification: Notification = match serde_json::from_str(&amp;line) {
            Ok(notification) =&gt; notification,
            Err(error) =&gt; {
              log::debug!(&quot;discarding malformed komorebi notification: {error}&quot;);
              continue;
            }
          };

          // match and filter on desired notifications
        }
      }
      Err(error) =&gt; {
        log::debug!(&quot;{error}&quot;);
      }
    }
  }

}
```

## Using Graft

Graft should be considered **Alpha** quality software. Thus, don&#039;t use it for production workloads yet.

### SQLite extension

The easiest way to use Graft is via the Graft SQLite extension which is called `libgraft`. [Please see the documentation][libgraft-docs] for instructions on how to download and use `libgraft`.

[libgraft-docs]: https://github.com/orbitinghail/graft/blob/main/docs/sqlite.md

### Rust Crate

Graft can be embedded in your Rust application directly, although for now that is left as an exercise for the reader. You can find the Rust docs here: https://docs.rs/graft-client

### Other languages?

Please [file an issue] if you&#039;d like to use Graft directly from a language other than Rust!

[file an issue]: https://github.com/orbitinghail/graft/issues/new

&lt;/p&gt;

## Installation

Download the latest release for your device from the [releases page](https://github.com/hanatsumi/rakuyomi/releases). The Kindle build has been reported to work with Kindle, Kobo and PocketBook devices; and it might work with other ARM-based e-reader devices. Feel free to open an issue if your e-reader is unsupported!

Place the `rakuyomi.koplugin` folder inside KOReader&#039;s `plugins` folder.

## Configuration

In order to use the plugin, you&#039;ll need to add some sources. rakuyomi is compatible with [Aidoku](https://github.com/Aidoku/Aidoku) sources. The easiest way to obtain sources is to configure _source lists_ and download the sources through the app.

You&#039;ll most likely find links with the format `https://aidoku.app/add-source-list/?url=&lt;source list URL&gt;`. Grab the source list URL from these links and make sure it ends with `/index.min.json`. If it doesn&#039;t, add it yourself.

Create a `rakuyomi/settings.json` file inside KOReader&#039;s home directory, with the following contents:

```json
{
    &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/hanatsumi/rakuyomi/releases/download/main/settings.schema.json&quot;,
    &quot;source_lists&quot;: [
        &quot;https://samplewebsite.com/sources/index.min.json&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;your source list URL&gt;&quot;
    ],
    &quot;languages&quot;: [&quot;en&quot;, &quot;&lt;your preferred language here&gt;&quot;]
}
```

After configuring a source list, sources can be installed through the plugin, by going to the main menu and going to &quot;Manage sources&quot;.

For a better manga reading experience, you might also look into KOReader&#039;s [reader recommended settings](./docs/reader-recommended-settings/index.md).

## Usage

In KOReader&#039;s file manager, go to the &quot;Search&quot; menu and tap on the &quot;Rakuyomi&quot; entry to open the library view. Tap the menu button on the top left to open the main menu.

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

# Apollo Router Core

The **Apollo Router Core** is a configurable, high-performance **graph router** written in Rust to run a [federated supergraph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) that uses [Apollo Federation 2](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v2/federation-2/new-in-federation-2).

Apollo Router Core is well-tested, regularly benchmarked, includes most major features of Apollo Gateway and is able to serve production-scale workloads.

New releases and their release notes (along with notes about any breaking changes) can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) page, and the latest release can always be found [on the latest page](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/latest). The `CHANGELOG.md` at the root of this repository also contains _unreleased_ changes in addition to the full history of changes.

Currently, we&#039;re publishing new releases every 1-2 weeks.

## Getting started

Follow the [quickstart tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/quickstart/) to get up and running with the router.

See [the documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router) for more details.

## Usage

Apollo Router Core requires [a supergraph file](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/supergraphs/) to be passed as the `--supergraph` argument and [an optional configuration file](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview/#yaml-config-file).
to be supplied. These are either located in the current directory or explicitly
specified via flag, either by an absolute path, or a path relative to the current
directory.

```
Usage:

Commands:
  config  Configuration subcommands
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --log &lt;LOG_LEVEL&gt;
          Log level (off|error|warn|info|debug|trace) [env: APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG=] [default: info]
      --hot-reload
          Reload locally provided configuration and supergraph files automatically.  This only affects watching of local files and does not affect supergraphs and configuration provided by GraphOS through Uplink, which is always reloaded immediately [env: APOLLO_ROUTER_HOT_RELOAD=]
  -c, --config &lt;CONFIG_PATH&gt;
          Configuration location relative to the project directory [env: APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH=]
      --dev
          Enable development mode [env: APOLLO_ROUTER_DEV=]
  -s, --supergraph &lt;SUPERGRAPH_PATH&gt;
          Schema location relative to the project directory [env: APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH=]

## Design principles

The development of the Apollo Router Core is driven by the following design principles that inform
architecture decisions and implementation.

**Correctness:** the router strives to be the most correct implementation of GraphQL and Federation, we care about testing and documenting everything implied by the specification, up to failure cases. The router’s behavior should follow the principle of least surprise for developers.

**Reliability:** the router is a critical part of GraphQL APIs, so it must be one of the strongest parts of the infrastructure. This implies stability in its behavior (no crashes, infinite loops, leaks, etc), availability (predictable latency, RAM and CPU usage, scalability) and observability (metrics, alerts). It should give strong confidence to infrastructure people that they can learn its limits and operate it safely.

**Safe experimentation:** the router will support all the future work around Federation, so it must allow new ideas and explorations without disturbing existing features. The project is still in movement, we cannot allow it to crystallize too early, while still following the principles of correctness and reliability.

**Usability:** the router must be simple to operate. Prefer extensibility over configuration options, and ensure that the user has enough information to help themselves when things go wrong. For example:

* Common environmental misconfiguration should be detected and surfaced to the user in the form of mitigation steps.
* User supplied extensions should be observable and flagged when they cause performance issues. Tell the users how much time an extension is consuming per request and why.

### Architecture

The following principles guide :

**Unit testability:** all new code should be unit testable, or have a good reason why it is not. This may mean spending a little extra time to ensure code is testable in isolation. Do not rely solely on integration testing.

**Integration test suite:** we will integrate with the gateway’s test suite and help improve it to test all aspects of the specifications. In particular, this test suite will verify failure cases like invalid queries or network problems. Integration tests must be bullet proof, and must not fail in the case of slow test execution or race conditions.

**Measurement and learning:** reliability has to be tested and measured, through benchmarks, profiling, and through exploration of the router’s limits. We want to learn how to operate the router and what is its nominal point. To that end, the router shall be instrumented in detail, allowing us to measure how code changes affect it. We especially take care of measuring the overhead of new features, to minimize latency and resource usage.

**Extensibility:** by allowing extensions and directives to modify the router’s behavior, we can run experiments and test new features without impacting specific queries or endpoints. Additionally, these experiments are easy to deactivate at runtime (feature flags, canaries, etc).

# Xilem

**An experimental Rust architecture for reactive UI**

&lt;/div&gt;

This repo contains an experimental architecture, implemented with a toy UI. At a very high level, it combines ideas from Flutter, SwiftUI, and Elm. Like all of these, it uses lightweight view objects, diffing them to provide minimal updates to a retained UI. Like SwiftUI, it is strongly typed.

## Community

[![Xi Zulip](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xi%20Zulip-%23xilem-blue?logo=Zulip)](https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/354396-xilem)

Discussion of Xilem development happens in the [Xi Zulip](https://xi.zulipchat.com/), specifically the [#xilem channel](https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/354396-xilem). 
All public content can be read without logging in

## Project structure

This diagram gives an idea what the Xilem project is built on:

![Xilem project layers](docs/assets/xilem-layers.svg)

On a very coarse level, Xilem is built directly on top of xilem_core and Masonry, both of which are crates in this repository.

Then Masonry is built on top of:

- **winit** for window creation.
- **Vello and wgpu** for 2D graphics.
- **Parley** for [the text stack](https://github.com/linebender/parley#the-Parley-text-stack).
- **AccessKit** for plugging into accessibility APIs.

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

&lt;!--- TODO: This needs a serious refactor.
This section should not be in the main README. --&gt;

### Overall program flow

&gt; **Warning:**
&gt;
&gt; This README is a bit out of date. To understand more of what&#039;s going on, please read the blog post, [Xilem: an architecture for UI in Rust].

Like Elm, the app logic contains *centralized state.* On each cycle (meaning, roughly, on each high-level UI interaction such as a button click), the framework calls a closure, giving it mutable access to the app state, and the return value is a *view tree.* This view tree is fairly short-lived; it is used to render the UI, possibly dispatch some events, and be used as a reference for *diffing* by the next cycle, at which point it is dropped.

We&#039;ll use the standard counter example. Here the state is a single integer, and the view tree is a column containing two buttons.

```rust
fn app_logic(data: &amp;mut u32) -&gt; impl View&lt;u32, (), Element = impl Widget&gt; {
    Column::new((
        Button::new(format!(&quot;count: {}&quot;, data), |data| *data += 1),
        Button::new(&quot;reset&quot;, |data| *data = 0),
    ))
}
```

These are all just vanilla data structures. The next step is diffing or reconciling against a previous version, now a standard technique. The result is an *element tree.* Each node type in the view tree has a corresponding element as an associated type. The `build` method on a view node creates the element, and the `rebuild` method diffs against the previous version (for example, if the string changes) and updates the element. There&#039;s also an associated state tree, not actually needed in this simple example, but would be used for memoization.

The closures are the interesting part. When they&#039;re run, they take a mutable reference to the app data.

### Components

A major goal is to support React-like components, where modules that build UI for some fragment of the overall app state are composed together. 

```rust
struct AppData {
    count: u32,
}

fn count_button(count: u32) -&gt; impl View&lt;u32, (), Element = impl Widget&gt; {
    Button::new(format!(&quot;count: {}&quot;, count), |data| *data += 1)
}

fn app_logic(data: &amp;mut AppData) -&gt; impl View&lt;AppData, (), Element = impl Widget&gt; {
    Adapt::new(|data: &amp;mut AppData, thunk| thunk.call(&amp;mut data.count),
        count_button(data.count))
}
```

This adapt node is very similar to a lens (quite familiar to existing Druid users), and is also very similar to the [Html.map] node in Elm. Note that in this case the data presented to the child component to render, and the mutable app state available in callbacks is the same, but that is not necessarily the case.

### Memoization

In the simplest case, the app builds the entire view tree, which is diffed against the previous tree, only to find that most of it hasn&#039;t changed.

When a subtree is a pure function of some data, as is the case for the button above, it makes sense to *memoize.* The data is compared to the previous version, and only when it&#039;s changed is the view tree build. The signature of the memoize node is nearly identical to [Html.lazy] in Elm:

```rust
fn app_logic(data: &amp;mut AppData) -&gt; impl View&lt;AppData, (), Element = impl Widget&gt; {
    Memoize::new(data.count, |count| {
        Button::new(format!(&quot;count: {}&quot;, count), |data: &amp;mut AppData| {
            data.count += 1
        })
    }),
}
```

The current code uses a `PartialEq` bound, but in practice I think it might be much more useful to use pointer equality on `Rc` and `Arc`.

The combination of memoization with pointer equality and an adapt node that calls [Rc::make_mut] on the parent type is actually a powerful form of change tracking, similar in scope to Adapton, self-adjusting computation, or the types of binding objects used in SwiftUI. If a piece of data is rendered in two different places, it automatically propagates the change to both of those, without having to do any explicit management of the dependency graph.

I anticipate it will also be possible to do dirty tracking manually - the app logic can set a dirty flag when a subtree needs re-rendering.

### Optional type erasure

By default, view nodes are strongly typed. The type of a container includes the types of its children (through the `ViewTuple` trait), so for a large tree the type can become quite large. In addition, such types don&#039;t make for easy dynamic reconfiguration of the UI. SwiftUI has exactly this issue, and provides [AnyView] as the solution. Ours is more or less identical.

The type erasure of View nodes is not an easy trick, as the trait has two associated types and the `rebuild` method takes the previous view as a `&amp;Self` typed parameter. Nonetheless, it is possible. (As far as I know, Olivier Faure was the first to demonstrate this technique, in [Panoramix], but I&#039;m happy to be further enlightened)

## Prerequisites

### Linux and BSD

You need to have installed `pkg-config`, `clang`, and the development packages of `wayland`,
`libxkbcommon`, `libxcb`, and `vulkan-loader`. Most distributions have `pkg-config` installed by default.

To install the remaining packages on Fedora, run:

```sh
sudo dnf install clang wayland-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel libxcb-devel vulkan-loader-devel
```

To install the remaining packages on Debian or Ubuntu, run:

```sh
sudo apt-get install clang libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libvulkan-dev
```

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Xilem has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.85** and later.

Future versions of Xilem might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click here if compiling fails.&lt;/summary&gt;

As time has passed, some of Xilem&#039;s dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don&#039;t want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency&#039;s name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Recommended Cargo Config

The Xilem repository includes a lot of projects and examples, most of them pulling a lot of dependencies.

If you contribute to Xilem on Linux or MacOS, we recommend using [`split-debuginfo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#split-debuginfo) in your
[`.cargo/config.toml`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure) file to reduce the size of the `target/` folder:

```toml
[profile.dev]
# One debuginfo file per dependency, to reduce file size of tests/examples.
# Note that this value is not supported on Windows.
# See https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#split-debuginfo
split-debuginfo=&quot;unpacked&quot;
```

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies:

* [`ab_glyph`](https://crates.io/crates/ab_glyph)
* [`ahash`](https://crates.io/crates/ahash)
* [`bitflags`](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags)
* [`nohash-hasher`](https://crates.io/crates/nohash-hasher)
* [`parking_lot`](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)

Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, …)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

### Writing your own egui integration
Missing an integration for the thing you&#039;re working on? Create one, it&#039;s easy!

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they suppor

# Time-aware multimodal data stack and visualizations
Rerun is building the multimodal data stack to model, ingest, store, query and view robotics-style data.
It&#039;s used in areas like robotics, spatial and embodied AI, generative media, industrial processing, simulation, security, and health.

Rerun is easy to use!
Use the Rerun SDK (available for C++, Python and Rust) to log data like images, tensors, point clouds, and text.
Logs are streamed to the Rerun Viewer for live visualization or to file for later use.
You can also query the logged data through [our dataframe API](https://rerun.io/docs/howto/dataframe-api).

[Get started](#getting-started) in minutes – no account needed.

* [Run the Rerun Viewer in your browser](https://www.rerun.io/viewer)
* [Read about what Rerun is and who it is for](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-rerun)

### A short taste
```py
import rerun as rr  # pip install rerun-sdk

rr.init(&quot;rerun_example_app&quot;)

rr.connect()  # Connect to a remote viewer
# rr.spawn()  # Spawn a child process with a viewer and connect
# rr.save(&quot;recording.rrd&quot;)  # Stream all logs to disk

# Associate subsequent data with 42 on the “frame” timeline
rr.set_time(&quot;frame&quot;, sequence=42)

# Log colored 3D points to the entity at `path/to/points`
rr.log(&quot;path/to/points&quot;, rr.Points3D(positions, colors=colors))
…
```

&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting started
* [**C++**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/cpp)
* [**Python**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/python): `pip install rerun-sdk` or on [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/rerun-sdk-feedstock)
* [**Rust**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/rust): `cargo add rerun`

### Installing the Rerun Viewer binary
To stream log data over the network or load our `.rrd` data files you also need the `rerun` binary.
It can be installed with `pip install rerun-sdk` or with `cargo install rerun-cli --locked --features nasm` (see note below).
Note that only the Python SDK comes bundled with the Viewer whereas C++ &amp; Rust always rely on a separate install.

**Note**: the `nasm` Cargo feature requires the [`nasm`](https://www.nasm.us) CLI to be installed and available in your path.
Alternatively, you may skip enabling this feature, but this may result in inferior video decoding performance.

You should now be able to run `rerun --help` in any terminal.

## Status
We are in active development.
There are many features we want to add, and the API is still evolving.
_Expect breaking changes!_

Some shortcomings:
* [The viewer slows down when there are too many entities](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/7115)
* [We don&#039;t support transparency yet](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1611)
* The data you want to visualize must fit in RAM
  - See &lt;https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/limit-ram&gt; for how to bound memory use.
  - We plan on having a disk-based data store some time in the future.
* [Multi-million point clouds can be slow](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1136)


## What is Rerun for?

Rerun is built to help you understand and improve complex processes that include rich multimodal data, like 2D, 3D, text, time series, tensors, etc.
It is used in many industries, including robotics, simulation, computer vision,
or anything that involves a lot of sensors or other signals that evolve over time.

### Example use case
Say you&#039;re building a vacuum cleaning robot and it keeps running into walls. Why is it doing that? You need some tool to debug it, but a normal debugger isn&#039;t gonna be helpful. Similarly, just logging text won&#039;t be very helpful either. The robot may log &quot;Going through doorway&quot; but that won&#039;t explain why it thinks the wall is a door.

What you need is a visual and temporal debugger, that can log all the different representations of the world the robots holds in its little head, such as:

* RGB camera feed
* depth images
* lidar scan
* segmentation image (how the robot interprets what it sees)
* its 3D map of the apartment
* all the objects the robot has detected (or thinks it has detected), as 3D shapes in the 3D map
* its confidence in its prediction
* etc

You also want to see how all these streams of data evolve over time so you can go back and pinpoint exactly what went wrong, when and why.

Maybe it turns out that a glare from the sun hit one of the sensors in the wrong way, confusing the segmentation network leading to bad object detection. Or maybe it was a bug in the lidar scanning code. Or maybe the robot thought it was somewhere else in the apartment, because its odometry was broken. Or it could be one of a thousand other things. Rerun will help you find out!

But seeing the world from the point of the view of the robot is not just for debugging - it will also give you ideas on how to improve the algorithms, new test cases to set up, or datasets to collect. It will also let you explain the brains of the robot to your colleagues, boss, and customers. And so on. Seeing is believing, and an image is worth a thousand words, and multimodal temporal logging is worth a thousand images :)

While seeing and understanding your data is core to making progress in robotics, there is one more thing:
You can also use the data you collected for visualization to create new datasets for training and evaluating the models and algorithms that run on your robot.
Rerun provides query APIs to make it easy to extract clean datasets from your recording for exactly that purpose.

Of course, Rerun is useful for much more than just robots. Any time you have any form of sensors, or 2D or 3D state evolving over time, Rerun is a great tool.


## Business model
Rerun uses an open-core model. Everything in this repository will stay open source and free (both as in beer and as in freedom).

We are also building a commercial data platform.
Right now that is only available for a few select design partners.
[Click here if you&#039;re interested](https://rerun.io/pricing).

The Rerun open source project targets the needs of individual developers.
The commercial product targets the needs specific to teams that build and run computer vision and robotics products.
