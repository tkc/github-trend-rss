## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust&#039;s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on
correctly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
&gt; the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
&gt; We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

Install optional dependencies as &#039;extras&#039; for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):

```bash
pip install -U &quot;nautilus_trader[docker,ib]&quot;
```

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |

**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.
Skipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, in

### Configuration Files

**Claude Code**

- Live config: `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `claude.json`)
- API key field: `env.ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or `env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- MCP servers: `~/.claude.json` → `mcpServers`

**Codex**

- Live config: `~/.codex/auth.json` (required) + `config.toml` (optional)
- API key field: `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `auth.json`
- MCP servers: `~/.codex/config.toml` → `[mcp_servers]` tables

**Gemini**

- Live config: `~/.gemini/.env` (API key) + `~/.gemini/settings.json` (auth mode)
- API key field: `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Environment variables: Support `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, etc.
- MCP servers: `~/.gemini/settings.json` → `mcpServers`
- Tray quick switch: Each provider switch rewrites `~/.gemini/.env`, no need to restart Gemini CLI

**CC Switch Storage (v3.8.0 New Architecture)**

- Database (SSOT): `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite, stores providers, MCP, Prompts, Skills)
- Local settings: `~/.cc-switch/settings.json` (device-level settings)
- Backups: `~/.cc-switch/backups/` (auto-rotate, keep 10)

### Cloud Sync Setup

1. Go to Settings → &quot;Custom Configuration Directory&quot;
2. Choose your cloud sync folder (Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.)
3. Restart app to apply
4. Repeat on other devices to enable cross-device sync

&gt; **Note**: First launch auto-imports existing Claude/Codex configs as default provider.

```

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

**v3.6 Refactoring**

- Backend: 5-phase refactoring (error handling → command split → tests → services → concurrency)
- Frontend: 4-stage refactoring (test infra → hooks → components → cleanup)
- Testing: 100% hooks coverage + integration tests (vitest + MSW)

            <h2>README</h2><pre># ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display

There is an ESP32 with a built in 320 x 240 2.8&quot; LCD display with a touch screen called the &quot;ESP32-2432S028R&quot;, since this doesn&#039;t roll of the tongue, I propose it should be renamed the &quot;Cheap Yellow Display&quot; or CYD for short. This display is only about $15 delivered so I think it&#039;s really good value.

![image](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display/assets/1562562/76c3d481-2523-4b6f-881c-2e29f9368cd0)

## Features

The CYD has the following features:

- ESP32 (With Wifi and Bluetooth)
- 320 x 240 LCD Display (2.8&quot;)
- Touch Screen (Resistive)
- USB for powering and programming
- SD Card Slot, LED and some additional pins broken out

## Who is it good for?

I think it&#039;s useful for the following types of people:

- **People just getting started with working hardware** - as everything is already connected, there is no soldering or additional components required
- **People who are familiar with working with hardware, but are lazy** - (like me) Sometimes you just want to build a project without having to assemble any hardware
- **People who aren&#039;t really looking to learn anything, but just want to build some cool things** - More about this later.

## What is the purpose of this page?

So this is pretty nice hardware and a cheap price, but the software instructions/support around it is pretty poor. Just a single link to a zip file on a random website.

A couple of years ago I released the [ESP32 Trinity](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Trinity), which is an open source ESP32 board for controlling Matrix panels. I think the main benefit people get out of the work I did on the Trinty is not the hardware, but the documentation, example code and ready to go projects.

I&#039;m no longer creating hardware products, but I think it would be interesting if we could create the same kind of community around this display, where people can share examples and projects made for this display.

## How do I know if a display is a CYD?

A hat-based orchestration framework that keeps Ralph in a loop until the task is done.

&gt; &quot;Me fail English? That&#039;s unpossible!&quot; - Ralph Wiggum

**Notice:** Ralph Orchestrator is under active development. It works today, but expect rough edges and breaking changes between releases.

v1.0.0 was ralphed into existence with little oversight and guidance. v2.0.0 is a simpler, more-structured implementation. Looking for the old version? See [v1.2.3](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator/tree/v1.2.3).

## What is Ralph?

Ralph implements the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) — autonomous task completion through continuous iteration.

&gt; &quot;The orchestrator is a thin coordination layer, not a platform. Ralph is smart; let Ralph do the work.&quot;

### Two Modes of Operation

Ralph supports two orchestration styles:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Traditional** | Simple loop — Ralph iterates until done | Quick tasks, simple automation, minimal config |
| **Hat-Based** | Ralph can wear many hats — specialized personas coordinate through events | Complex workflows, multi-step processes, role separation |

**Traditional mode** is the original Ralph Wiggum approach: start a loop, let it run until it outputs the completion promise. No roles, no events, just iteration.

**Hat-based mode** adds structure: specialized personas coordinate through events. You define the roles that fit your workflow — reviewers, testers, documenters, whatever makes sense. Presets provide ready-made patterns like TDD or spec-driven development.

### The Ralph Tenets

1. **Fresh Context Is Reliability** — Each iteration clears context. Re-read specs, plan, code every cycle.
2. **Backpressure Over Prescription** — Don&#039;t prescribe how; create gates that reject bad work.
3. **The Plan Is Disposable** — Regeneration costs one planning loop. Cheap.
4. **Disk Is State, Git Is Memory** — Files are the handoff mechanism.
5. **Steer With Signals, Not Scripts** — Add signs, not scripts.
6. **Let Ralph Ralph** — Sit *on* the loop, not *in* it.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full philosophy.

## Features

- **Multi-Backend Support** — Works with Claude Code, Kiro, Gemini CLI, Codex, Amp, Copilot CLI, and OpenCode
- **Hat System** — Specialized Ralph personas with distinct behaviors
- **Event-Driven Coordination** — Hats communicate through typed events with glob pattern matching
- **Backpressure Enforcement** — Gates that reject incomplete work (tests, lint, typecheck)
- **Presets Library** — 20+ pre-configured workflows for common development patterns
- **Interactive TUI** — Real-time terminal UI for monitoring Ralph&#039;s activity (experimental)
- **Session Recording** — Record and replay sessions for debugging and testing (experimental)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75+
- At least one AI CLI:
  - [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (recommended)
  - [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
  - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
  - [Amp](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp)
  - [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot) (`npm install -g @github/copilot`)
  - [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`)

### Via npm (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @ralph-orchestrator/ralph-cli

# Or run directly with npx
npx @ralph-orchestrator/ralph-cli --version
```

### Via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install ralph-orchestrator
```

### Via Cargo

```bash
cargo install ralph-cli
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator.git
cd ralph-orchestrator
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release&quot;

# Or create symlink
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/target/release/ralph /usr/local/bin/ralph
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
ralph --version
ralph --help
```

### Migrating from v1 (Python)

If you have the old Python-based Ralph v1 installed, uninstall it first to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# If installed via pip
pip uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# If installed via pipx
pipx uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# If installed via uv
uv tool uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# Verify removal
which ralph  # Should return nothing or point to new Rust version
```

The v1 Python version is no longer maintained. See [v1.2.3](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator/tree/v1.2.3) for historical reference.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Project

```bash
# Traditional mode — simple loop, no hats (recommended for getting started)
ralph init --backend claude

# Hat-based mode — use a preset workflow with specialized personas
ralph init --preset tdd-red-green

# Combine preset with different backend
ralph init --preset spec-driven --backend kiro

# See all available presets
ralph init --list-presets
```

This creates `ralph.yml` in your current directory. Without a preset, you get traditional mode (no hats). With a preset, you get hat-based orchestration.

### 2. Define Your Task

**Option A:** Create a `PROMPT.md` file:

```bash
cat &gt; PROMPT.md &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
Build a REST API with the following endpoints:
- POST /users - Create a new user
- GET /users/:id - Get user by ID
- PUT /users/:id - Update user
- DELETE /users/:id - Delete user

Use Express.js with TypeScript. Include input validation
and proper error handling.
EOF
```

**Option B:** Pass inline prompt when running:

```bash
ralph run -p &quot;Add input validation to the user API endpoints&quot;
```

### 3. Run Ralph

```bash
# Autonomous mode (headless, default)
ralph run

# With inline prompt
ralph run -p &quot;Implement the login endpoint with JWT authentication&quot;

# TUI mode (experimental)
ralph run --tui

# Resume interrupted session
ralph resume

# Dry run (show what would execute)
ralph run --dry-run
```

### Alternative: SOP-Driven Sessions

For standalone planning and task generation (without Ralph&#039;s event loop), use these commands:

```bash
# Start an interactive PDD planning session
ralph plan                           # SOP prompts for input
ralph plan &quot;build a REST API&quot;        # Provide idea inline
ralph plan --backend kiro &quot;my idea&quot;  # Use specific backend

# Generate code task files from descriptions
ralph task                           # SOP prompts for input
ralph task &quot;add authentication&quot;      # From description
ralph task specs/feature/plan.md     # From PDD plan file
```

These commands spawn an interactive AI session with bundled SOPs — perfect for one-off planning without configuring a full workflow.

## Configuration

Ralph uses a YAML configuration file (`ralph.yml` by default).

### Traditional Mode (No Hats)

The simplest configuration — just a loop that runs until completion:

```yaml
# ralph.yml — Traditional mode
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;

event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;
  max_iterations: 100
```

This runs Ralph in a loop. No hats, no events, no role switching. Ralph iterates until it outputs `LOOP_COMPLETE` or hits the iteration limit.

### Hat-Based Mode (Specialized Personas)

&gt; Ralph can wear many hats.

Add a `hats` section to enable role-based orchestration. Hats subscribe to events (triggers) and publish events when done:

```yaml
# ralph.yml — Hat-based mode (example structure)
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;

event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;
  max_iterations: 100
  starting_event: &quot;task.start&quot;

hats:
  my_hat:
    name: &quot;🎯 My Hat&quot;
    triggers: [&quot;task.start&quot;]        # Events that activate this hat
    publishes: [&quot;work.done&quot;]        # Events this hat can emit
    instructions: |
      Your instructions here...
```

With hats, Ralph publishes a starting event, which triggers the matching hat. That hat does its work and publishes an event, potentially triggering other hats. This event-driven handoff continues until completion.

&gt; **Tip:** Use `ralph init --preset &lt;name&gt;` to get pre-configured hat workflows. See [Presets](#presets) for ready-made patterns like TDD, spec-driven development, and more.

### Full Configuration Reference

```yaml
# Event loop settings
event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;  # Output that signals completion
  max_iterations: 100                   # Maximum orchestration loops
  max_runtime_seconds: 14400            # 4 hours max runtime
  idle_timeout_secs: 1800               # 30 min idle timeout
  starting_event: &quot;task.start&quot;          # First event published

# CLI backend settings
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;                     # claude, kiro, gemini, codex, amp, copilot, opencode, custom
  prompt_mode: &quot;arg&quot;                    # arg (CLI argument) or stdin

# Core behaviors (always injected into prompts)
core:
  scratchpad: &quot;.agent/scratchpad.md&quot;    # Shared memory across iterations
  specs_dir: &quot;./specs/&quot;                 # Directory for specifications
  guardrails:                           # Rules injected into every prompt
    - &quot;Fresh context each iteration - scratchpad is memory&quot;
    - &quot;Don&#039;t assume &#039;not implemented&#039; - search first&quot;
    - &quot;Backpressure is law - tests/typecheck/lint must pass&quot;

# Custom hats (omit to use default planner/builder)
hats:
  my_hat:
    name: &quot;My Hat Name&quot;                 # Display name
    triggers: [&quot;some.event&quot;]            # Events that activate this hat
    publishes: [&quot;other.event&quot;]          # Events this hat can emit
    instructions: |                     # Prompt instructions
      What this hat should do...
```

```

## Key Concepts

### Hats

Hats are specialized Ralph personas. Each hat has:

- **Triggers**: Events that activate this hat
- **Publishes**: Events this hat can emit
- **Instructions**: Prompt injected when hat is active

View event history:

```bash
ralph events
```

### Scratchpad

All hats share `.agent/scratchpad.md` — persistent memory across iterations. This enables hats to build on previous work rather than starting fresh.

The scratchpad is the primary mechanism for:
- Task tracking (with `[ ]`, `[x]`, `[~]` markers)
- Context preservation between iterations
- Handoff between hats

### Backpressure

Ralph enforces quality gates through backpressure. When a builder publishes `build.done`, it must include evidence:

```
tests: pass, lint: pass, typecheck: pass
```

## Building &amp; Testing

### Build

```bash
cargo build           # Debug build
cargo build --release # Release build
```

### Test

```bash
# Run all tests (includes smoke tests with JSONL replay)
cargo test

# Run smoke tests specifically
cargo test -p ralph-core smoke_runner

# Run Kiro-specific smoke tests
cargo test -p ralph-core kiro
```

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests use recorded JSONL fixtures instead of live API calls — fast, free, and deterministic.

**Fixture locations:**
- `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/basic_session.jsonl` — Claude CLI session
- `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/kiro/` — Kiro CLI sessions

**Recording new fixtures:**

```bash
# Record a session
ralph run -c ralph.yml --record-session session.jsonl -p &quot;your prompt&quot;

# Or capture raw CLI output
claude -p &quot;your prompt&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee output.txt
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
cargo fmt --check
```

&gt; Life is short, skim!

We spend so much of our time navigating through files, lines, and commands. That&#039;s where Skim comes in!
It&#039;s a powerful fuzzy finder designed to make your workflow faster and more efficient.

[![skim demo](https://asciinema.org/a/pIfwazaM0mTHA8F7qRbjrqOnm.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/pIfwazaM0mTHA8F7qRbjrqOnm)

Skim provides a single executable called `sk`. Think of it as a smarter alternative to tools like
`grep` - once you try it, you&#039;ll wonder how you ever lived without it!

# Installation

The skim project contains several components:

1. `sk` executable - the core program
2. Vim/Nvim plugin - to call `sk` inside Vim/Nvim. Check [skim.vim](https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/blob/master/plugin/skim.vim) for Vim support.

&lt;/a&gt;

## Manually

Any of the following applies:

- Using Git
    ```sh
    $ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:skim-rs/skim.git ~/.skim
    $ ~/.skim/install
    ```
- Using Binary: Simply [download the sk executable](https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/releases) directly.
- Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/): Run `cargo install skim`
- Build Manually:
    ```sh
    $ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:skim-rs/skim.git ~/.skim
    $ cd ~/.skim
    $ cargo install
    $ cargo build --release
    $ # Add the resulting `target/release/sk` executable to your PATH
    ```

# Usage

Skim can be used either as a general filter (similar to `grep`) or as an interactive
interface for running commands.

## As Vim plugin

Via vim-plug (recommended):

Install skim, then :

```vim
Plug &#039;skim-rs/skim&#039;
```


## As filter

Here are some examples to get you started:

```bash
# directly invoke skim
sk

# Or pipe some input to it (press TAB key to select multiple items when -m is enabled)
vim $(find . -name &quot;*.rs&quot; | sk -m)
```
This last command lets you select files with the &quot;.rs&quot; extension and opens
your selections in Vim - a great time-saver for developers!

## As Interactive Interface

`skim` can invoke other commands dynamically. Normally you would want to
integrate it with [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/),
[ack](https://github.com/petdance/ack2),
[ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), or
[rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for searching contents in a
project directory:

```sh
# works with grep
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;grep -rI --color=always --line-number &quot;{}&quot; .&#039;
# works with ack
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;ack --color &quot;{}&quot;&#039;
# works with ag
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;ag --color &quot;{}&quot;&#039;
# works with rg
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;rg --color=always --line-number &quot;{}&quot;&#039;
```

&gt; **Note**: In these examples, `{}` will be literally expanded to the current input query.
&gt; This means these examples will search for the exact query string, not fuzzily.
&gt; For fuzzy searching, pipe the command output into `sk` without using interactive mode.

![interactive mode demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1527040/21603930/655d859a-d1db-11e6-9fec-c25099d30a12.gif)

## Shell Bindings

Bindings for Fish, Bash and Zsh are available in the `shell` directory:
- `completion.{shell}` contains the completion scripts for `sk` cli usage
- `key-bindings.{shell}` contains key-binds and shell integrations:
    - `ctrl-t` to select a file through `sk`
    - `ctrl-r` to select an history entry through `sk`
    - `alt-c`  to `cd` into a directory selected through `sk`
    - (not available in `fish`) `**` to complete file paths, for example `ls **&lt;tab&gt;` will show a `sk` widget to select a folder

To enable these features, source the `key-bindings.{shell}` file and set up completions according to your shell&#039;s documentation or see below.

### Shell Completions

You can generate shell completions for your preferred shell using the `--shell` flag with one of the supported shells: `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, or `elvish`:

&gt; **Note:** While PowerShell completions are supported, Windows is not supported for now.

#### Option 1: Source directly in your current shell session

```sh
# For bash
source &lt;(sk --shell bash)

# For zsh
source &lt;(sk --shell zsh)

# For fish
sk --shell fish | source
```

#### Option 2: Save to a file to be loaded automatically on shell startup

```sh
# For bash, add to ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;source &lt;(sk --shell bash)&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc  # Or save to ~/.bash_completion

# For zsh, add to ~/.zshrc
sk --shell zsh &gt; ~/.zfunc/_sk  # Create ~/.zfunc directory and add to fpath in ~/.zshrc

# For fish, add to ~/.config/fish/completions/
sk --shell fish &gt; ~/.config/fish/completions/sk.fish
```

## Key Bindings

Some commonly used key bindings:

| Key               | Action                                     |
|------------------:|--------------------------------------------|
| Enter             | Accept (select current one and quit)       |
| ESC/Ctrl-G        | Abort                                      |
| Ctrl-P/Up         | Move cursor up                             |
| Ctrl-N/Down       | Move cursor Down                           |
| TAB               | Toggle selection and move down (with `-m`) |
| Shift-TAB         | Toggle selection and move up (with `-m`)   |

For a complete list of key bindings, refer to the [man
page](https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/blob/master/man/man1/sk.1) (`man sk`).

## Search Syntax

`skim` borrows `fzf`&#039;s syntax for matching items:

| Token    | Match type                 | Description                       |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `text`   | fuzzy-match                | items that match `text`           |
| `^music` | prefix-exact-match         | items that start with `music`     |
| `.mp3$`  | suffix-exact-match         | items that end with `.mp3`        |
| `&#039;wild`  | exact-match (quoted)       | items that include `wild`         |
| `!fire`  | inverse-exact-match        | items that do not include `fire`  |
| `!.mp3$` | inverse-suffix-exact-match | items that do not end with `.mp3` |

`skim` also supports the combination of tokens.

- Whitespace has the meaning of `AND`. With the term `src main`, `skim` will search
    for items that match **both** `src` and `main`.
- ` | ` means `OR` (note the spaces around `|`). With the term `.md$ |
    .markdown$`, `skim` will search for items ends with either `.md` or
    `.markdown`.
- `OR` has higher precedence. For example, `readme .md$ | .markdown$` is interpreted as
    `readme AND (.md$ OR .markdown$)`.

If you prefer using regular expressions, `skim` offers a `regex` mode:

```sh
sk --regex
```

You can switch to `regex` mode dynamically by pressing `Ctrl-R` (Rotate Mode).

## exit code

| Exit Code | Meaning                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 0         | Exited normally                     |
| 1         | No Match found                      |
| 130       | Aborted by Ctrl-C/Ctrl-G/ESC/etc... |

# Tools compatible with `skim`

These tools are or aim to be compatible with `skim`:

## [fzf-lua neovim plugin](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua)

A [neovim](https://neovim.io) plugin allowing fzf and skim to be used in a to navigate your code.

Install it with your package manager, following the README. For instance, with `lazy.nvim`:

```lua
{
  &quot;ibhagwan/fzf-lua&quot;,
  -- enable `sk` support instead of the default `fzf`
  opts = {&#039;skim&#039;}
}
```

## [nu_plugin_skim](https://github.com/idanarye/nu_plugin_skim)

A [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) plugin to allow for better interaction between skim and nushell.

Following the instruction in the plugin&#039;s README, you can install it with cargo:
```nu
cargo install nu_plugin_skim
plugin add ~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_skim
```

# Customization

The doc here is only a preview, please check the man page (`man sk`) for a full
list of options.

## Keymap

Specify the bindings with comma separated pairs (no space allowed). For example:

```sh
sk --bind &#039;alt-a:select-all,alt-d:deselect-all&#039;
```

Additionally, use `+` to concatenate actions, such as `execute-silent(echo {} | pbcopy)+abort`.

See the _KEY BINDINGS_ section of the man page for details.

## Sort Criteria

There are five sort keys for results: `score, index, begin, end, length`. You can
specify how the records are sorted by `sk --tiebreak score,index,-begin` or any
other order you want.

## Color Scheme

You probably have your own aesthetic preferences! Fortunately, you aren&#039;t
limited to the default appearance - Skim supports comprehensive customization of its color scheme.

```sh
--color=[BASE_SCHEME][,COLOR:ANSI]
```

Skim also respects the `NO_COLOR` environment variable. Set it to anything and `sk` (and many other terminal apps) will disable all colored output. See [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) for more details.

### Available Base Color Schemes

Skim comes with several built-in color schemes that you can use as a starting point:

```sh
sk --color=dark      # Default dark theme (256 colors)
sk --color=light     # Light theme (256 colors)
sk --color=16        # Simple 16-color theme
sk --color=bw        # Minimal black &amp; white theme (no colors, just styles)
sk --color=none      # Minimal black &amp; white theme (no colors, no styles)
sk --color=molokai   # Molokai-inspired theme (256 colors)
```

### Customizing Colors

You can customize individual UI elements by specifying color values after the base scheme:

```sh
sk --color=light,fg:232,bg:255,current_bg:116,info:27
```

Colors can be specified in several ways:

- ANSI colors (0-255): `sk --color=fg:232,bg:255`
- RGB hex values: `sk --color=fg:#FF0000` (red text)

### Available Color Customization Options

The following UI elements can be customized:

| Element            | Description                                 | Example                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `fg`               | Normal text foreground color                | `--color=fg:232`               |
| `bg`               | Normal text background color                | `--color=bg:255`               |
| `matched`          | Matched text in search results              | `--color=matched:108`          |
| `matched_bg`       | Background of matched text                  | `--color=matched_bg:0`         |
| `current`          | Current line foreground color               | `--color=current:254`          |
| `current_bg`       | Current line background color               | `--color=current_bg:236`       |
| `current_match`    | Matched text in current line                | `--color=current_match:151`    |
| `current_match_bg` | Background of matched text in current line  | `--color=current_match_bg:236` |
| `spinner`          | Progress indicator color                    | `--color=spinner:148`          |
| `info`             | Information line color                      | `--color=info:144`             |
| `prompt`           | Prompt color                                | `--color=prompt:110`           |
| `cursor`           | Cursor color                                | `--color=cursor:161`           |
| `selected`         | Selected item marker color                  | `--color=selected:168`         |
| `header`           | Header text color                           | `--color=header:109`           |
| `border`           | Border color for preview/layout             | `--color=border:59`            |

### Examples

```sh
# Use light theme but change the current line background
sk --color=light,current_bg:24

# Custom theme with multiple colors
sk --color=dark,matched:#00FF00,current:#FFFFFF,current_bg:#000080

# High contrast theme
sk --color=fg:232,bg:255,matched:160,current:255,current_bg:20
```

For more details, check the man page (`man sk`).

## Misc

- `--ansi`: to parse ANSI color codes (e.g., `\e[32mABC`) of the data source
- `--regex`: use the query as regular expression to match the data source

# Advanced Topics

## Interactive mode

In **interactive mode**, you can invoke a command dynamically. Try it out:

```sh
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;rg --color=always --line-number &quot;{}&quot;&#039;
```

### How does it work?

![How Skim&#039;s interactive mode works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1527040/53381293-461ce380-39ab-11e9-8e86-7c3bbfd557bc.png)

- Skim  accepts two kinds of sources: Command output or piped input
- Skim has two kinds of prompts: A query prompt to specify the query pattern and a
    command prompt to specify the &quot;arguments&quot; of the command
- `-c` is used to specify the command to execute and defaults to `SKIM_DEFAULT_COMMAND`
- `-i` tells skim to open command prompt on startup, which will show `c&gt;` by default.

To further narrow down the results returned by the command, press
`Ctrl-Q` to toggle interactive mode.

## Executing external programs

You can configure key bindings to start external processes without leaving Skim (`execute`, `execute-silent`).

```sh
# Press F1 to open the file with less without leaving skim
# Press CTRL-Y to copy the line to clipboard and aborts skim (requires pbcopy)
sk --bind &#039;f1:execute(less -f {}),ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo {} | pbcopy)+abort&#039;
```

## Preview Window

This is a great feature of fzf that skim borrows. For example, we use &#039;ag&#039; to
find the matched lines, and once we narrow down to the target lines, we want to
finally decide which lines to pick by checking the context around the line.
`grep` and `ag` have the option `--context`, and skim can make use of `--context` for
a better preview window. For example:

```sh
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;ag --color &quot;{}&quot;&#039; --preview &quot;preview.sh {}&quot;
```

(Note that [preview.sh](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim/blob/master/bin/preview.sh) is a script to print the context given filename:lines:columns)

You get things like this:

![preview demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1527040/30677573-0cee622e-9ebf-11e7-8316-c741324ecb3a.png)

### How does it work?

If the preview command is given by the `--preview` option, skim will replace the
`{}` with the current highlighted line surrounded by single quotes, call the
command to get the output, and print the output on the preview window.

Sometimes you don&#039;t need the whole line for invoking the command. In this case
you can use `{}`, `{1..}`, `{..3}` or `{1..5}` to select the fields. The
syntax is explained in the section [Fields Support](#filds-support).

Lastly, you might want to configure the position of preview window with `--preview-window`:
- `--preview-window up:30%` to put the window in the up position with height
    30% of the total height of skim.
- `--preview-window left:10:wrap` to specify the `wrap` allows the preview
    window to wrap the output of the preview command.
- `--preview-window wrap:hidden` to hide the preview window at startup, later
    it can be shown by the action `toggle-preview`.

## Fields support

Normally only plugin users need to understand this.

For example, you have the data source with the format:

```sh
&lt;filename&gt;:&lt;line number&gt;:&lt;column number&gt;
```

However, you want to search `&lt;filename&gt;` only when typing in queries. That
means when you type `21`, you want to find a `&lt;filename&gt;` that contains `21`,
but not matching line number or column number.

You can use `sk --delimiter &#039;:&#039; --nth 1` to achieve this.

You can also use `--with-nth` to re-arrange the order of fields.

**Range Syntax**

- `&lt;num&gt;` -- to specify the `num`-th fields, starting with 1.
- `start..` -- starting from the `start`-th fields and the rest.
- `..end` -- starting from the `0`-th field, all the way to `end`-th field,
    including `end`.
- `start..end` -- starting from `start`-th field, all the way to `end`-th
    field, including `end`.

## Use as a library

Skim can be used as a library in your Rust crates.

First, add skim into your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
skim = { version = &quot;&lt;version&gt;&quot;, default-features = false, features = [..] }
```

_Note on features_:
    - the `cli` feature is required to use skim as a cli, it *should* not be needed when using it as a library.
    - the `nightly-frizbee` feature adds the frizbee algorithm, but requires cargo nigthly.

Then try to run this simple example:

```rust
extern crate skim;
use skim::prelude::*;
use std::io::Cursor;

pub fn main() {
    let options = SkimOptionsBuilder::default()
        .height(String::from(&quot;50%&quot;))
        .multi(true)
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    let input = &quot;aaaaa\nbbbb\nccc&quot;.to_string();

    // `SkimItemReader` is a helper to turn any `BufRead` into a stream of `SkimItem`
    // `SkimItem` was implemented for `AsRef&lt;str&gt;` by default
    let item_reader = SkimItemReader::default();
    let items = item_reader.of_bufread(Cursor::new(input));

    // `run_with` would read and show items from the stream
    let selected_items = Skim::run_with(&amp;options, Some(items))
        .map(|out| out.selected_items)
        .unwrap_or_else(|| Vec::new());

    for item in selected_items.ite

## Overview

AI coding agents are increasingly writing the world&#039;s code and human engineers now spend the majority of their time planning, reviewing, and orchestrating tasks. Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:

- Easily switch between different coding agents
- Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence
- Quickly review work and start dev servers
- Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on
- Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs
- Open projects remotely via SSH when running Vibe Kanban on a remote server

You can watch a video overview [here](https://youtu.be/TFT3KnZOOAk).

## Installation

Make sure you have authenticated with your favourite coding agent. A full list of supported coding agents can be found in the [docs](https://vibekanban.com/docs). Then in your terminal run:

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

## Documentation

Please head to the [website](https://vibekanban.com/docs) for the latest documentation and user guides.

## Support

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) for feature requests. Please open a discussion to create a feature request. For bugs please open an issue on this repo.

## Contributing

We would prefer that ideas and changes are first raised with the core team via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/AC4nwVtJM3), where we can discuss implementation details and alignment with the existing roadmap. Please do not open PRs without first discussing your proposal with the team.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (&gt;=18)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (&gt;=8)

Additional development tools:
```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Running the dev server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the backend. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.

### Building the frontend

To build just the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm build
```

### Build from source (macOS)

1. Run `./local-build.sh`
2. Test with `cd npx-cli &amp;&amp; node bin/cli.js`


### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |
| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |
| `PORT` | Runtime | Auto-assign | **Production**: Server port. **Dev**: Frontend port (backend uses PORT+1) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT+1) |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend dev server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT) |
| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |
| `MCP_HOST` | Runtime | Value of `HOST` | MCP server connection host (use `127.0.0.1` when `HOST=0.0.0.0` on Windows) |
| `MCP_PORT` | Runtime | Value of `BACKEND_PORT` | MCP server connection port |
| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_ORPHAN_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable git worktree cleanup (for debugging) |
| `VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Runtime | Not set | Comma-separated list of origins that are allowed to make backend API requests (e.g., `https://my-vibekanban-frontend.com`) |

**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.

#### Self-Hosting with a Reverse Proxy or Custom Domain

When running Vibe Kanban behind a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, Caddy, Traefik) or on a custom domain, you must set the `VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. Without this, the browser&#039;s Origin header won&#039;t match the backend&#039;s expected host, and API requests will be rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.

Set it to the full origin URL(s) where your frontend is accessible:

```bash
# Single origin
VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://vk.example.com

# Multiple origins (comma-separated)
VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://vk.example.com,https://vk-staging.example.com
```

### Remote Deployment

When running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (e.g., via systemctl, Docker, or cloud hosting), you can configure your editor to open projects via SSH:

1. **Access via tunnel**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or similar to expose the web UI
2. **Configure remote SSH** in Settings → Editor Integration:
   - Set **Remote SSH Host** to your server hostname or IP
   - Set **Remote SSH User** to your SSH username (optional)
3. **Prerequisites**:
   - SSH access from your local machine to the remote server
   - SSH keys configured (passwordless authentication)
   - VSCode Remote-SSH extension

When configured, the &quot;Open in VSCode&quot; buttons will generate URLs like `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path` that open your local editor and connect to the remote server.

See the [documentation](https://vibekanban.com/docs/configuration-customisation/global-settings#remote-ssh-configuration) for detailed setup instructions.

## Roadmap

Stalwart has reached an exciting point in its journey, it’s now **feature complete**. All the core functionality and open standard email and collaboration protocols that we set out to support are in place. In other words, Stalwart already does everything you’d expect from a modern, standards-compliant mail and collaboration platform.

The next major milestone is all about refinement: finalizing the database schema and focusing on performance optimizations to ensure everything runs as efficiently and reliably as possible. Once that’s done, we’ll be ready to roll out version **1.0**.

Of course, development doesn’t stop there. The community has contributed hundreds of great ideas for improvements and new features, everything from subtle usability tweaks to entirely new integrations. You can see the full list of proposals over on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Aenhancement). If there’s something you’d like to see prioritized, just give it a thumbs up as we plan to implement enhancements based on the community’s votes.

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ — the state of your application
* __Messages__ — user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ — a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ — a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

&gt; **January 2026**: Worktrunk was [released](https://x.com/max_sixty/status/2006077845391724739?s=20) over the holidays, and lots of folks seem to be using it. It&#039;s built with love (there&#039;s no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), &amp; [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg). Please let me know any frictions at all; I&#039;m intensely focused on making Worktrunk excellent, and the biggest gap is understanding how others experience using it.

Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for running AI agents in parallel.

Worktrunk&#039;s three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches. Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows.

Scaling agents becomes trivial. A quick demo:

## Context: git worktrees

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without
supervision, such that it&#039;s possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git&#039;s native
worktree feature give each agent its own working directory, so they don&#039;t step
on each other&#039;s changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new
worktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat
../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.

## Worktrunk makes git worktrees as easy as branches

Worktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template.

&gt; Start with the core commands

**Core commands:**

&lt;table class=&quot;cmd-compare&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Task&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Worktrunk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Plain git&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Switch worktrees&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt switch feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd ../repo.feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Create + start Claude&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt switch -c -x claude feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
cd ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
claude&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Clean up&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt remove&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd ../repo &amp;&amp; \
git worktree remove ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
git branch -d feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;List with status&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt list&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git worktree list&lt;/pre&gt; (paths only)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

**Workflow automation:**

&gt; Expand into the more advanced commands as needed

- **[Hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc
- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs via [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/)
- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- ...and **[lots more](#next-steps)**

A demo with some advanced features:

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS &amp; Linux):**

```bash
brew install worktrunk &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

Shell integration allows commands to change directories.

**Cargo:**

```bash
cargo install worktrunk &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

On Windows, `wt` defaults to Windows Terminal&#039;s command. Winget additionally installs Worktrunk as `git-wt` to avoid the conflict:

```bash
winget install max-sixty.worktrunk
git-wt config shell install
```

Alternatively, disable Windows Terminal&#039;s alias (Settings → Privacy &amp; security → For developers → App Execution Aliases → disable &quot;Windows Terminal&quot;) to use `wt` directly.

&lt;/details&gt;

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
paru worktrunk-bin &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

## What does this do?

This is a cross-platform software keyboard remapper for Linux, macOS and Windows.
A short summary of the features:

- multiple layers of key functionality
- advanced key behaviour customization (e.g. tap-hold, macros, unicode)

To see all of the features, see the [configuration guide](./docs/config.adoc).

You can find pre-built binaries in the [releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
or read on for build instructions.

You can see a [list of known issues here](./docs/platform-known-issues.adoc).

### Demo

#### Demo video
[Showcase of multi-layer functionality (30s, 1.7 MB)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6634136/183001314-f64a7e26-4129-4f20-bf26-7165a6e02c38.mp4).

#### Online simulator

You can check out the [online simulator](https://jtroo.github.io)
to test configuration validity and test input simulation.

## Why is this useful?

Imagine if, instead of pressing Shift to type uppercase letters, we had giant
keyboards with separate keys for lowercase and uppercase letters. I hope we can
all agree: that would be a terrible user experience!

A way to think of how Shift keys work is that they switch your input to another
layer of functionality where you now type uppercase letters and symbols
instead of lowercase letters and numbers.

What kanata allows you to do is take this alternate layer concept that Shift
keys have and apply it to any key. You can then customize what those layers do
to suit your exact needs and workflows.

## Usage

Running kanata currently does not start it in a background process.
You will need to keep the window that starts kanata running to keep kanata active.
Some tips for running kanata in the background:

- Windows: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/193
- Linux: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/130#discussioncomment-10227272
- Run from tray icon: [kanata-tray](https://github.com/rszyma/kanata-tray)

### Pre-built executables

See the
[releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
for executables and instructions.

### Build it yourself

This project uses the latest Rust stable toolchain. If you installed the
Rust toolchain using `rustup`, e.g. by using the instructions from the
[official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started),
you can get the latest stable toolchain with `rustup update stable`.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

Using `cargo install`:

    cargo install kanata

    # On Linux and macOS, this may not work without `sudo`, see below
    kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Linux:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is used because kanata opens /dev/ files
    #
    # See below if you want to avoid needing sudo:
    # https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/wiki/Avoid-using-sudo-on-Linux
    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Windows.

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive
    target\debug\kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in macOS:

First install the Karabiner driver by following the macOS documentation
in the [releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/).

Then you can compile and run with the instructions below:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is needed to gain permission to intercept the keyboard

    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

The full configuration guide is [found here](./docs/config.adoc).

Sample configuration files are found in [cfg_samples](./cfg_samples). The
[simple.kbd](./cfg_samples/simple.kbd) file contains a basic configuration file
that is hopefully easy to understand but does not contain all features. The
`kanata.kbd` contains an example of all features with documentation. The
release assets also have a `kanata.kbd` file that is tested to work with that
release. All key names can be found in the [keys module](./parser/src/keys/mod.rs),
and you can also define your own key names.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Feature flags

When either building yourself or using `cargo install`,
you can add feature flags that
enable functionality that is turned off by default.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

If you want to enable the `cmd` actions,
add the flag `--features cmd`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd
cargo install --features cmd
```

On Windows,
if you want to compile a binary that uses the Interception driver,
you should add the flag `--features interception_driver`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features interception_driver
cargo install --features interception_driver
```

To combine multiple flags,
use a single `--features` flag
and use a comma to separate the features.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd,interception_driver
cargo install --features cmd,interception_driver
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## What does the name mean?

I wanted a &quot;k&quot; word since this relates to keyboards. According to Wikipedia,
kanata is an indigenous Iroquoian word meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot; and is
the origin of Canada&#039;s name.

There&#039;s also PPT✧.

## Motivation

TLDR: QMK features but for any keyboard, not just fancy mechanical ones.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Long version&lt;/summary&gt;

I have a few keyboards that run [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/). QMK allows the
user to customize the functionality of their keyboard to their heart&#039;s content.

One great use case of QMK is its ability map keys so that they overlap with the
home row keys but are accessible on another layer. I won&#039;t comment on
productivity, but I find this greatly helps with my keyboard comfort.

For example, these keys are on the right side of the keyboard:

    7 8 9
    u i o
    j k l
    m , .

On one layer I have arrow keys in the same position, and on another layer I
have a numpad.

    arrows:       numpad:
    - - -         7 8 9
    - ↑ -         4 5 6
    ← ↓ →         1 2 3
    - - -         0 * .

One could add as many customizations as one likes to improve comfort, speed,
etc. Personally my main motivator is comfort due to a repetitive strain injury
in the past.

However, QMK doesn&#039;t run everywhere. In fact, it doesn&#039;t run on **most**
hardware you can get. You can&#039;t get it to run on a laptop keyboard or any
mainstream office keyboard. I believe that the comfort and empowerment QMK
provides should be available to anyone with a computer on their existing
hardware, instead of having to purchase an enthusiast mechanical keyboard
(which are admittedly very nice — I own a few — but can be costly).

The best alternative solution that I found for keyboards that don&#039;t run QMK was
[kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad). This is an excellent project
and I recommend it if you want to try something similar.

The reason for this project&#039;s existence is that kmonad is written in Haskell
and I have no idea how to begin contributing to a Haskell project. From an
outsider&#039;s perspective I think Haskell is a great language but I really can&#039;t
wrap my head around it. And there are a few [outstanding issues](./docs/kmonad_comparison.md)
at the time of writing that make kmonad suboptimal for my personal workflows.

This project is written in Rust because Rust is my favourite programming
language and the prior work of the awesome [keyberon crate](https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon)
exists.
&lt;/details&gt;

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

## Repository Structure

The main components of this repository are structured as follows:

  * `core/`: The implementation of `libp2p-core` with its `Transport` and
    `StreamMuxer` API on which almost all other crates depend.

  * `transports/`: Implementations of transport protocols (e.g. TCP) and protocol upgrades
    (e.g. for authenticated encryption, compression, ...) based on the `libp2p-core` `Transport`
    API.

  * `muxers/`: Implementations of the `StreamMuxer` interface of `libp2p-core`,
    e.g. (sub)stream multiplexing protocols on top of (typically TCP) connections.
    Multiplexing protocols are (mandatory) `Transport` upgrades.

&lt;/picture&gt;

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [pmem device](docs/pmem.md) to the microVM.
- Configure and manage [memory hotplugging](docs/memory-hotplug.md).
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.
