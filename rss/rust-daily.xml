## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic —  with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto and Betting, enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

developer/user communities.
However, Python has performance and typing limitations for large-scale, latency-sensitive systems. Cython addresses many of these issues by introducing static typing into Python&#039;s rich ecosystem of libraries and communities.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

**NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** or on demand.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels **ship** in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) is [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) compliant and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

**Note**: Wheels from the `develop` branch are only built for the Linux x86_64 platform to save time
and compute resources, while `nightly` wheels support additional platforms as shown below.

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | -       |

This process also helps preserve compute resources and ensures easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We don&#039;t recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip installs the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212` for December 12, 2024):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.208.0a20241212 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).

To programmatically fetch and list available versions:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP &#039;(?&lt;=&lt;a href=&quot;)[^&quot;]+(?=&quot;)&#039; | awk -F&#039;#&#039; &#039;{print $1}&#039; | sort
```

![Nightly Tests][tests-badge]

## Overview

This repository contains implementation for the Monad consensus client and JsonRpc server. Monad consensus collects transactions and produces blocks which are written to a ledger filestream. These blocks are consumed by Monad execution, which then updates the state of the blockchain. The [triedb](monad-triedb/README.md) is a database which stores block information and the blockchain state.

## Getting Started

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Using Docker

The most straightforward way to start a consensus client + an execution client + a JsonRpc server. Run the following:
1. `cd docker/single-node`
2. `nets/run.sh`

### Using Cargo

To run a Monad consensus client, follow instructions [here](monad-node/README.md).
 
To run a JsonRpc server, follow instructions [here](monad-rpc/README.md).

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

These are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.

***If you&#039;ll click on the image, you&#039;ll be led to an SVG version of it on the website where you can directly click on every issue***

[![roadmap](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/assets/795598/9c5b573b-20f5-41c6-908b-6b21c5fd456e)](https://zellij.dev/roadmap)

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: الزليج, romanized: zillīj; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

1. Prerequisites:
   - [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) (for GPU support, optional)

2. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lumina-ai-inc/chunkr
cd chunkr
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your llm models
cp models.example.yaml models.yaml
```

For more information on how to set up LLMs, see [here](#llm-configuration).

4. Start the services:
```bash
# For GPU deployment:
docker compose up -d

# For CPU-only deployment:
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.cpu.yaml up -d

# For Mac ARM architecture (M1, M2, M3, etc.):
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.cpu.yaml -f compose.mac.yaml up -d
```

5. Access the services:
   - Web UI: `http://localhost:5173`
   - API: `http://localhost:8000`

6. Stop the services when done:
```bash
# For GPU deployment:
docker compose down

# For CPU-only deployment:
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.cpu.yaml down

# For Mac ARM architecture (M1, M2, M3, etc.):
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.cpu.yaml -f compose.mac.yaml down
```
## LLM Configuration

Chunkr supports two ways to configure LLMs:

1. **models.yaml file**: Advanced configuration for multiple LLMs with additional options
2. **Environment variables**: Simple configuration for a single LLM

### Using models.yaml (Recommended)

For more flexible configuration with multiple models, default/fallback options, and rate limits:

1. Copy the example file to create your configuration:
```bash
cp models.example.yaml models.yaml
```

2. Edit the models.yaml file with your configuration. Example:
```yaml
models:
  - id: gpt-4o
    model: gpt-4o
    provider_url: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
    api_key: &quot;your_openai_api_key_here&quot;
    default: true
    rate-limit: 200 # requests per minute - optional
```

Benefits of using models.yaml:
- Configure multiple LLM providers simultaneously
- Set default and fallback models
- Add distributed rate limits per model
- Reference models by ID in API requests (see docs for more info)

&gt;Read the `models.example.yaml` file for more information on the available options.

### Using environment variables (Basic)

You can use any OpenAI API compatible endpoint by setting the following variables in your .env file:
``` 
LLM__KEY:
LLM__MODEL:
LLM__URL:
```

### Common LLM API Providers

Below is a table of common LLM providers and their configuration details to get you started:

| Provider         | API URL                                                                  | Documentation                                                                                                                          |

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful
as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you
need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience,
consider signing up to our [collaborative online editor][app] for free.

## Example
A [gentle introduction][tutorial] to Typst is available in our documentation.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Example&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


Let&#039;s dissect what&#039;s going on:

- We use _set rules_ to configure element properties like the size of pages or
  the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to `auto`, it scales to
  fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you
  need full control, you can also use [show rules][show] to completely redefine
  the appearance of an element.

- We insert a heading with the `= Heading` syntax. One equals sign creates a top
  level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight
  markup like this, see the [syntax] reference for a full list.

- [Mathematical equations][math] are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra
  spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block.
  Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions
  unless put into quotes. This way, we don&#039;t need backslashes for things like
  `floor` and `sqrt`. And `phi.alt` applies the `alt` modifier to the `phi` to
  select a particular symbol variant.

- Now, we get to some [scripting]. To input code into a Typst document, we can
  write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a
  recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the
  results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells
  row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas `$F_1$` to `$F_8$` and then
  the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator (`..`) to both
  because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays&#039; items as individual
  arguments.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Text version of the code example.&lt;/summary&gt;

  ```typst
  #set page(width: 10cm, height: auto)
  #set heading(numbering: &quot;1.&quot;)

  = Fibonacci sequence
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined through the
  recurrence relation $F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)$.
  It can also be expressed in _closed form:_

  $ F_n = round(1 / sqrt(5) phi.alt^n), quad
    phi.alt = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 $

  #let count = 8
  #let nums = range(1, count + 1)
  #let fib(n) = (
    if n &lt;= 2 { 1 }
    else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
  )

  The first #count numbers of the sequence are:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: count,
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; $F_#n$),
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; str(fib(n))),
  ))
  ```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation
Typst&#039;s CLI is available from different sources:

- You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst
  from the [releases page][releases]. Download the archive for your platform and
  place it in a directory that is in your `PATH`. To stay up to date with future
  releases, you can simply run `typst update`.

- You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the
  versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release.
  - Linux:
      - View [Typst on Repology][repology]
      - View [Typst&#039;s Snap][snap]
  - macOS: `brew install typst`
  - Windows: `winget install --id Typst.Typst`

- If you have a [Rust][rust] toolchain installed, you can install
  - the latest released Typst version with
    `cargo install --locked typst-cli`
  - a development version with
    `cargo install --git https://github.com/typst/typst --locked typst-cli`

- Nix users can
  - use the `typst` package with `nix-shell -p typst`
  - build and run a development version with
    `nix run github:typst/typst -- --version`.

- Docker users can run a prebuilt image with
  `docker run ghcr.io/typst/typst:latest --help`.

## Usage
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `file.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile file.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile path/to/source.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch file.typ
```

Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all
of the fonts it discovered:
```sh
# Adds additional directories to search for fonts.
typst compile --font-path path/to/fonts file.typ

# Lists all of the discovered fonts in the system and the given directory.
typst fonts --font-path path/to/fonts

# Or via environment variable (Linux syntax).
TYPST_FONT_PATHS=path/to/fonts typst fonts
```

For other CLI subcommands and options, see below:
```sh
# Prints available subcommands and options.
typst help

# Prints detailed usage of a subcommand.
typst help watch
```

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant 
preview, you can also check out our [free web app][app]. Alternatively, there is 
a community-created language server called 
[Tinymist](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/) which is integrated into 
various editor extensions.

## Community
The main places where the community gathers are our [Forum][forum] and our
[Discord server][discord]. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help
others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more
suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat.
We&#039;d be happy to see you there!

[Typst Universe][universe] is where the community shares templates and packages.
If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our
[package repository][packages].

If you had a bad experience in our community, please [reach out to us][contact].

## Contributing
We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel
free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix,
please follow the steps outlined in the [contribution guide][contributing].

To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the
[latest stable Rust][rust] installed. Then, clone this repository and build the
CLI with the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typst/typst
cd typst
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be stored in `target/release/`.

Another good way to contribute is by [sharing packages][packages] with the
community.

## Pronunciation and Spelling
IPA: /taɪpst/. &quot;Ty&quot; like in **Ty**pesetting and &quot;pst&quot; like in Hi**pst**er. When
writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital &quot;T&quot;.

## Design Principles
All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power,
simplicity, and performance. We think it&#039;s time for a system that matches the
power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize
instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles:

- **Simplicity through Consistency:**
  If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that
  knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing,
  one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g.
  it&#039;s okay that `= Introduction` and `#heading[Introduction]` do the same thing
  because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter.

- **Power through Composability:**
  There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or
  have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the
  second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we&#039;ve
  never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it&#039;s a bit
  low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don&#039;t really
  have that much composability. Instead, there&#039;s a package for everything
  (`\usepackage{knob}`).

- **Performance through Incrementality:**
  All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation.
  Luckily we have [`comemo`], a system for incremental compilation which does
  most of the hard work in the background.

# TensorZero

&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tensorzero.com/github-trending-badge.svg&quot; alt=&quot;#1 Repository Of The Day&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**TensorZero is an open-source stack for _industrial-grade LLM applications_:**

- **Gateway:** access every LLM provider through a unified API, built for performance (&lt;1ms p99 latency)
- **Observability:** store inferences and feedback in your database, available programmatically or in the UI
- **Optimization:** collect metrics and human feedback to optimize prompts, models, and inference strategies
- **Evaluation:** benchmark individual inferences or end-to-end workflows using heuristics, LLM judges, etc.
- **Experimentation:** ship with confidence with built-in A/B testing, routing, fallbacks, retries, etc.

Take what you need, adopt incrementally, and complement with other tools.

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is TensorZero?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;TensorZero is an open-source stack for industrial-grade LLM applications. It unifies an LLM gateway, observability, optimization, evaluation, and experimentation.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How is TensorZero different from other LLM frameworks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
      1. TensorZero enables you to optimize complex LLM applications based on production metrics and human feedback.&lt;br&gt;
      2. TensorZero supports the needs of industrial-grade LLM applications: low latency, high throughput, type safety, self-hosted, GitOps, customizability, etc.&lt;br&gt;
      3. TensorZero unifies the entire LLMOps stack, creating compounding benefits. For example, LLM evaluations can be used for fine-tuning models alongside AI judges.
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I use TensorZero with ___?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Yes. Every major programming language is supported. You can use TensorZero with our Python client, any OpenAI SDK or OpenAI-compatible client, or our HTTP API.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is TensorZero production-ready?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Yes. Here&#039;s a case study: &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorzero.com/blog/case-study-automating-code-changelogs-at-a-large-bank-with-llms&quot;&gt;Automating Code Changelogs at a Large Bank with LLMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much does TensorZero cost?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Nothing. TensorZero is 100% self-hosted and open-source. There are no paid features.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who is building TensorZero?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Our technical team includes a former Rust compiler maintainer, machine learning researchers (Stanford, CMU, Oxford, Columbia) with thousands of citations, and the chief product officer of a decacorn startup. We&#039;re backed by the same investors as leading open-source projects (e.g. ClickHouse, CockroachDB) and AI labs (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic).&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I get started?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;You can adopt TensorZero incrementally. Our &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/quickstart&quot;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; goes from a vanilla OpenAI wrapper to a production-ready LLM application with observability and fine-tuning in just 5 minutes.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;
          Need something else?
          Your provider is most likely supported because TensorZero integrates with &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/gateway/guides/providers/openai-compatible&quot;&gt;any OpenAI-compatible API (e.g. Ollama)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.

```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version

Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

## Contributing

Before you start working on something, it&#039;s best to check if there is an existing issue first. It&#039;s also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

Thank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!

### Documentation

Documentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation in the Rust &amp; JS source code as much as possible. Check out the hosting repository for the documentation site for further information: &lt;https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs&gt;

OpenObserve (O2 for short) is a cloud-native observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces, analytics, RUM (Real User Monitoring - Performance, Errors, Session Replay) designed to work at petabyte scale.

It is straightforward and easy to operate, in contrast to Elasticsearch, which requires understanding and tuning numerous settings. Get OpenObserve up and running in under 2 minutes.

OpenObserve serves as a seamless replacement for Elasticsearch for users who ingest data using APIs and perform searches. OpenObserve comes with its own user interface, eliminating the need for separate installation.

You can reduce your log storage costs by ~140x compared to Elasticsearch by using OpenObserve. Below, we present the results from pushing logs from our production Kubernetes cluster to both Elasticsearch and OpenObserve using Fluent Bit.

```
docker run --rm \
-v $APP_CONFIG_FOLDER:/app/config/ \
-v $APP_CACHE_FOLDER:/app/cache/ \
-it aome510/spotify_player:latest
```

## Features

### Spotify Connect

To enable a full [Spotify connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) support, user will need to register a Spotify application and specify the application&#039;s `client_id` in the general configuration file as described in the [configuration documentation](docs/config.md#general).

More details about registering a Spotify application can be found in the [official Spotify documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).

When `spotify_player` runs with your own `client_id`, press **D** (default shortcut for `SwitchDevice` command) to get the list of available devices, then press **enter** (default shortcut for `ChooseSelected` command) to connect to the selected device.

### Streaming

`spotify_player` supports streaming, which needs to be built/installed with `streaming` feature (**enabled** by default) **and** with an audio backend (`rodio-backend` by default). The streaming feature allows to `spotify_player` to play music directly from terminal.

The application uses [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library to create an integrated Spotify client while running. The integrated client will register a Spotify speaker device under the `spotify-player` name, which is accessible on the [Spotify connect](#spotify-connect) device list.

#### Audio backend

`spotify_player` uses [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio) as the default [audio backend](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends). List of available audio backends:

- `alsa-backend`
- `pulseaudio-backend`
- `rodio-backend`
- `portaudio-backend`
- `jackaudio-backend`
- `rodiojack-backend`
- `sdl-backend`
- `gstreamer-backend`

User can change the audio backend when building/installing the application by specifying the `--features` option. For example, to install `spotify_player` with `pulseaudio-backend`, run

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features pulseaudio-backend
```

**Note**:

- needs to specify `--no-default-features` here because `rodio-backend` is one of the default features.
- user will need to install additional dependencies depending on the selected audio backend. More details can be found in the [Librespot documentation](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies).

The `streaming` feature can be also disabled upon installing by running

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features
```

### Media Control

To enable media control support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `media-control` feature (**enabled** by default) and set the `enable_media_control` config option to `true` in the [general configuration file](docs/config.md#media-control).

Media control support is implemented using [MPRIS DBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) on Linux and OS window event listener on Windows and MacOS.

### Image

To enable image rendering support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `image` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `image` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features image
```

`spotify_player` supports rendering image in a full resolution if the application is run on either [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Otherwise, the image will be displayed as [block characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements).

`spotify_player` also supports rendering images with `sixel` behind `sixel` feature flag, which also enables `image` feature:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features sixel
```

**Notes**:

- Not all terminals supported by [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) are supported by `spotify_player` as it relies on a [third-party library](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer) for image rendering. A possible list of supported terminals can be found in [here](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/blob/dc81f44a97727e04be0b000712e9233c92116ff8/src/printer/sixel.rs#L83-L95).
- Images rendered by `sixel` can have a _weird_ scale. It&#039;s recommended to tweak the `cover_img_scale` config option to get the best result as the scaling works differently with different terminals and fonts.

Examples of image rendering:

- iTerm2:

![iTerm2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172966798-0aadc431-b0c3-4433-adf3-7526684fc2a0.png)

- Kitty:

- Sixel (`foot` terminal, `cover_img_scale=1.8`):

#### Pixelate

If your terminal supports high-res images, but you like the pixelated look you can enable the `pixelate` feature, which also enables the `image` feature:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features pixelate
```

The amount of pixels can be tweaked via the `cover_img_pixels` config option.

| `cover_img_pixels` | `8` | `16` | `32` | `64` |
|--------------------|-----|------|------|------|
|       example      | &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;8x8&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4137aaea-ce28-4019-8cd5-2d14327e72e4&quot; /&gt; | &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;16x16&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca94748-093a-468c-8fb3-1f5639666eb6&quot; /&gt; | &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;32x32&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d0f2da-0439-47e4-91c9-3a2aa73ac90c&quot; /&gt; | &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;64x64&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06ef731-38fa-424d-9672-313f56c193d0&quot; /&gt; |

To temporarily disable the `pixelate` feature just set `cover_img_pixels` to a high value like `512`.

### Notify

To enable desktop notification support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `notify` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `notify` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features notify
```

**Note**: the notification support in `MacOS` and `Windows` are quite restricted compared to `Linux`.

### Mouse support

Currently, the only supported use case for mouse is to seek to a position of the current playback by left-clicking to such position in the playback&#039;s progress bar.

### Daemon

To enable a [daemon](&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)&gt;) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `daemon` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `daemon` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features daemon
```

You can run the application as a daemon by specifying the `-d` or `--daemon` option: `spotify_player -d`.

**Notes**:

- `daemon` feature is not supported on Windows
- `daemon` feature requires the `streaming` feature to be enabled and the application to be built with [an audio backend](#audio-backend)
- because of the OS&#039;s restrictions, `daemon` feature doesn&#039;t work with the `media-control` feature on MacOS, which is **enabled by default**. In other words, if you want to use the `daemon` feature on MacOS, you must install the application with `media-control` feature **disabled**:

  ```shell
  cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features daemon,rodio-backend
  ```

### Fuzzy search

To enable [fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `fzf` feature (**disabled** by default).

### CLI Commands

`spotify_player` offers several CLI commands to interact with Spotify:

- `get`: Get Spotify data (playlist/album/artist data, user&#039;s data, etc)
- `playback`: Interact with the playback (start a playback, play-pause, next, etc)
- `search`: Search spotify
- `connect`: Connect to a Spotify device
- `like`: Like currently playing track
- `authenticate`: Authenticate the application
- `playlist`: Playlist editing (new, delete, import, fork, etc)

For more details, run `spotify_player -h` or `spotify_player {command} -h`, in which `{command}` is a CLI command.

**Notes**

- When using the CLI for the first time, you&#039;ll need to run `spotify_player authenticate` to authenticate the application beforehand.
- Under the hood, CLI command is handled by sending requests to a `spotify_player` client socket running on port `client_port`, [a general application configuration](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md#general) with a default value of `8080`. If there is no running application&#039;s instance, a new client will be created upon handling the CLI commands, which increases the latency of the command.

#### Scripting

The `spotify_player` command-line interface makes scripting easy.
With the `search` subcommand, you can search Spotify and retrieve data in JSON format, enabling queries with tools like [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

Here’s an example of starting playback for the first track from a search query:

```sh
read -p &quot;Search spotify: &quot; query
spotify_player playback start track --id $(spotify_player search &quot;$query&quot; | jq &#039;.tracks.[0].id&#039; | xargs)
```

## Commands

To go to the shortcut help page, press `?` or `C-h` (default shortcuts for `OpenCommandHelp` command).

**Tips**:

- you can search in the shortcut help page (and some other pages) using `Search` command
- `RefreshPlayback` can be used to manually update the playback status.
- `RestartIntegratedClient` is useful when user wants to switch to another audio device (headphone, earphone, etc) without restarting the application, as the integrated client will be re-initialized with the new device.

&gt; 🚧 **Beta Software**
&gt;
&gt; Rolldown is currently in beta status. While it can already handle most production use cases, there may still be bugs and rough edges. Most notably, the built-in minification feature is still in alpha status.

# Rolldown

Rolldown is a JavaScript/TypeScript bundler written in Rust intended to serve as the future bundler used in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It provides Rollup-compatible APIs and plugin interface, but will be more similar to esbuild in scope.

A super-easy, composable, web server framework for warp speeds.

The fundamental building block of `warp` is the `Filter`: they can be combined
and composed to express rich requirements on requests.

Thanks to its `Filter` system, warp provides these out of the box:

* Path routing and parameter extraction
* Header requirements and extraction
* Query string deserialization
* JSON and Form bodies
* Multipart form data
* Static Files and Directories
* Websockets
* Access logging
* Gzip, Deflate, and Brotli compression

Since it builds on top of [hyper](https://hyper.rs), you automatically get:

- HTTP/1
- HTTP/2
- Asynchronous
- One of the fastest HTTP implementations
- Tested and **correct**

## Example

Add warp and Tokio to your dependencies:

```toml
tokio = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
warp = { version = &quot;0.4&quot;, features = [&quot;server&quot;] }
```

And then get started in your `main.rs`:

```rust
use warp::Filter;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // GET /hello/warp =&gt; 200 OK with body &quot;Hello, warp!&quot;
    let hello = warp::path!(&quot;hello&quot; / String)
        .map(|name| format!(&quot;Hello, {}!&quot;, name));

    warp::serve(hello)
        .run(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3030))
        .await;
}
```

For more information you can check the [docs](https://docs.rs/warp) or the [examples](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/tree/master/examples).

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

Vector is maintained by the Datadog&#039;s [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.

## Documentation

All user documentation is available at **[vector.dev/docs](https://vector.dev/docs)**.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;

CocoIndex makes it super easy to transform data with AI workloads, and keep source data and target in sync effortlessly.

&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/venn-features.png&quot; alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot; width=&#039;400&#039;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;

Either creating embedding, building knowledge graphs, or any data transformations - beyond traditional SQL.

## Exceptional velocity
Just declare transformation in dataflow with ~100 lines of python

```python
# import
data[&#039;content&#039;] = flow_builder.add_source(...)

# transform
data[&#039;out&#039;] = data[&#039;content&#039;]
    .transform(...)
    .transform(...)

# collect data
collector.collect(...)

# export to db, vector db, graph db ...
collector.export(...)
```

CocoIndex follows the idea of [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) programming model. Each transformation creates a new field solely based on input fields, without hidden states and value mutation. All data before/after each transformation is observable, with lineage out of the box.

**Particularly**, developers don&#039;t explicitly mutate data by creating, updating and deleting. They just need to define transformation/formula for a set of source data.

## Build like LEGO
Native builtins for different source, targets and transformations. Standardize interface, make it 1-line code switch between different components.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/components.svg&quot; alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Data Freshness
CocoIndex keep source data and target in sync effortlessly.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4eb29b3-84ee-4fa0-a1e2-80eedeeabde6&quot; alt=&quot;Incremental Processing&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It has out-of-box support for incremental indexing:
- minimal recomputation on source or logic change.
- (re-)processing necessary portions; reuse cache when possible

## Quick Start:
If you&#039;re new to CocoIndex, we recommend checking out
- 📖 [Documentation](https://cocoindex.io/docs)
- ⚡  [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart)
- 🎬 [Quick Start Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gv5R8nOXsWU?si=9ioeKYkMEnYevTXT)

### Setup

1. Install CocoIndex Python library

```bash
pip install -U cocoindex
```

2. [Install Postgres](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/installation#-install-postgres) if you don&#039;t have one. CocoIndex uses it for incremental processing.


## Define data flow

Follow [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart) to define your first indexing flow. An example flow looks like:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name=&quot;TextEmbedding&quot;)
def text_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    # Add a data source to read files from a directory
    data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;] = flow_builder.add_source(cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path=&quot;markdown_files&quot;))

    # Add a collector for data to be exported to the vector index
    doc_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()

    # Transform data of each document
    with data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;].row() as doc:
        # Split the document into chunks, put into `chunks` field
        doc[&quot;chunks&quot;] = doc[&quot;content&quot;].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language=&quot;markdown&quot;, chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=500)

        # Transform data of each chunk
        with doc[&quot;chunks&quot;].row() as chunk:
            # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
            chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;] = chunk[&quot;text&quot;].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
                    model=&quot;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&quot;))

            # Collect the chunk into the collector.
            doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc[&quot;filename&quot;], location=chunk[&quot;location&quot;],
                                   text=chunk[&quot;text&quot;], embedding=chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;])

    # Export collected data to a vector index.
    doc_embeddings.export(
        &quot;doc_embeddings&quot;,
        cocoindex.targets.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=[&quot;filename&quot;, &quot;location&quot;],
        vector_indexes=[
            cocoindex.VectorIndexDef(
                field_name=&quot;embedding&quot;,
                metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

It defines an index flow like this:

## Experimental technology disclaimer

Codex CLI is an experimental project under active development. It is not yet stable, may contain bugs, incomplete features, or undergo breaking changes. We&#039;re building it in the open with the community and welcome:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Pull requests
- Good vibes

Help us improve by filing issues or submitting PRs (see the section below for how to contribute)!

## Quickstart

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex  # Alternatively: `brew install codex`
```

Or go to the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest) and download the appropriate binary for your platform.

### OpenAI API Users

Next, set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This command sets the key only for your current terminal session. You can add the `export` line to your shell&#039;s configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`), but we recommend setting it for the session.

### OpenAI Plus/Pro Users

If you have a paid OpenAI account, run the following to start the login process:

```
codex login
```

If you complete the process successfully, you should have a `~/.codex/auth.json` file that contains the credentials that Codex will use.

To verify whether you are currently logged in, run:

```
codex login status
```

If you encounter problems with the login flow, please comment on &lt;https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243&gt;.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;--profile&lt;/code&gt; to use other models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Codex also allows you to use other providers that support the OpenAI Chat Completions (or Responses) API.

To do so, you must first define custom [providers](./config.md#model_providers) in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For example, the provider for a standard Ollama setup would be defined as follows:

```toml
[model_providers.ollama]
name = &quot;Ollama&quot;
base_url = &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1&quot;
```

The `base_url` will have `/chat/completions` appended to it to build the full URL for the request.

For providers that also require an `Authorization` header of the form `Bearer: SECRET`, an `env_key` can be specified, which indicates the environment variable to read to use as the value of `SECRET` when making a request:

```toml
[model_providers.openrouter]
name = &quot;OpenRouter&quot;
base_url = &quot;https://openrouter.ai/api/v1&quot;
env_key = &quot;OPENROUTER_API_KEY&quot;
```

Providers that speak the Responses API are also supported by adding `wire_api = &quot;responses&quot;` as part of the definition. Accessing OpenAI models via Azure is an example of such a provider, though it also requires specifying additional `query_params` that need to be appended to the request URL:

```toml
[model_providers.azure]
name = &quot;Azure&quot;
# Make sure you set the appropriate subdomain for this URL.
base_url = &quot;https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai&quot;
env_key = &quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;  # Or &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;, whichever you use.
# Newer versions appear to support the responses API, see https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/1321
query_params = { api-version = &quot;2025-04-01-preview&quot; }
wire_api = &quot;responses&quot;
```

Once you have defined a provider you wish to use, you can configure it as your default provider as follows:

```toml
model_provider = &quot;azure&quot;
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you find yourself experimenting with a variety of models and providers, then you likely want to invest in defining a _profile_ for each configuration like so:

```toml
[profiles.o3]
model_provider = &quot;azure&quot;
model = &quot;o3&quot;

[profiles.mistral]
model_provider = &quot;ollama&quot;
model = &quot;mistral&quot;
```

This way, you can specify one command-line argument (.e.g., `--profile o3`, `--profile mistral`) to override multiple settings together.

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Run interactively:

```shell
codex
```

Or, run with a prompt as input (and optionally in `Full Auto` mode):

```shell
codex &quot;explain this codebase to me&quot;
```

```shell
codex --full-auto &quot;create the fanciest todo-list app&quot;
```

That&#039;s it - Codex will scaffold a file, run it inside a sandbox, install any
missing dependencies, and show you the live result. Approve the changes and
they&#039;ll be committed to your working directory.

---

## Using Open Source Models

Codex can run fully locally against an OpenAI-compatible OSS host (like Ollama) using the `--oss` flag:

- Interactive UI:
  - codex --oss
- Non-interactive (programmatic) mode:
  - echo &quot;Refactor utils&quot; | codex exec --oss

Model selection when using `--oss`:

- If you omit `-m/--model`, Codex defaults to -m gpt-oss:20b and will verify it exists locally (downloading if needed).
- To pick a different size, pass one of:
  - -m &quot;gpt-oss:20b&quot;
  - -m &quot;gpt-oss:120b&quot;

Point Codex at your own OSS host:

- By default, `--oss` talks to http://localhost:11434/v1.
- To use a different host, set one of these environment variables before running Codex:
  - CODEX_OSS_BASE_URL, for example:
    - CODEX_OSS_BASE_URL=&quot;http://my-ollama.example.com:11434/v1&quot; codex --oss -m gpt-oss:20b
  - or CODEX_OSS_PORT (when the host is localhost):
    - CODEX_OSS_PORT=11434 codex --oss

Advanced: you can persist this in your config instead of environment variables by overriding the built-in `oss` provider in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[model_providers.oss]
name = &quot;Open Source&quot;
base_url = &quot;http://my-ollama.example.com:11434/v1&quot;
```

## Why Codex?

Codex CLI is built for developers who already **live in the terminal** and want
ChatGPT-level reasoning **plus** the power to actually run code, manipulate
files, and iterate - all under version control. In short, it&#039;s _chat-driven
development_ that understands and executes your repo.

- **Zero setup** - bring your OpenAI API key and it just works!
- **Full auto-approval, while safe + secure** by running network-disabled and directory-sandboxed
- **Multimodal** - pass in screenshots or diagrams to implement features ✨

And it&#039;s **fully open-source** so you can see and contribute to how it develops!

---

## Security model &amp; permissions

Codex lets you decide _how much autonomy_ you want to grant the agent. The following options can be configured independently:

- [`approval_policy`](./codex-rs/config.md#approval_policy) determines when you should be prompted to approve whether Codex can execute a command
- [`sandbox`](./codex-rs/config.md#sandbox) determines the _sandbox policy_ that Codex uses to execute untrusted commands

By default, Codex runs with `--ask-for-approval untrusted` and `--sandbox read-only`, which means that:

- The user is prompted to approve every command not on the set of &quot;trusted&quot; commands built into Codex (`cat`, `ls`, etc.)
- Approved commands are run outside of a sandbox because user approval implies &quot;trust,&quot; in this case.

Running Codex with the `--full-auto` convenience flag changes the configuration to `--ask-for-approval on-failure` and `--sandbox workspace-write`, which means that:

- Codex does not initially ask for user approval before running an individual command.
- Though when it runs a command, it is run under a sandbox in which:
  - It can read any file on the system.
  - It can only write files under the current directory (or the directory specified via `--cd`).
  - Network requests are completely disabled.
- Only if the command exits with a non-zero exit code will it ask the user for approval. If granted, it will re-attempt the command outside of the sandbox. (A common case is when Codex cannot `npm install` a dependency because that requires network access.)

Again, these two options can be configured independently. For example, if you want Codex to perform an &quot;exploration&quot; where you are happy for it to read anything it wants but you never want to be prompted, you could run Codex with `--ask-for-approval never` and `--sandbox read-only`.

### Platform sandboxing details

The mechanism Codex uses to implement the sandbox policy depends on your OS:

- **macOS 12+** uses **Apple Seatbelt** and runs commands using `sandbox-exec` with a profile (`-p`) that corresponds to the `--sandbox` that was specified.
- **Linux** uses a combination of Landlock/seccomp APIs to enforce the `sandbox` configuration.

Note that when running Linux in a containerized environment such as Docker, sandboxing may not work if the host/container configuration does not support the necessary Landlock/seccomp APIs. In such cases, we recommend configuring your Docker container so that it provides the sandbox guarantees you are looking for and then running `codex` with `--sandbox danger-full-access` (or, more simply, the `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` flag) within your container.

---

## Memory &amp; project docs

You can give Codex extra instructions and guidance using `AGENTS.md` files. Codex looks for `AGENTS.md` files in the following places, and merges them top-down:

1. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` - personal global guidance
2. `AGENTS.md` at repo root - shared project notes
3. `AGENTS.md` in the current working directory - sub-folder/feature specifics

---

## Non-interactive / CI mode

Run Codex head-less in pipelines. Example GitHub Action step:

```yaml
- name: Update changelog via Codex
  run: |
    npm install -g @openai/codex
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}&quot;
    codex exec --full-auto &quot;update CHANGELOG for next release&quot;
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Codex CLI can be configured to leverage MCP servers by defining an [`mcp_servers`](./codex-rs/config.md#mcp_servers) section in `~/.codex/config.toml`. It is intended to mirror how tools such as Claude and Cursor define `mcpServers` in their respective JSON config files, though the Codex format is slightly different since it uses TOML rather than JSON, e.g.:

```toml
# IMPORTANT: the top-level key is `mcp_servers` rather than `mcpServers`.
[mcp_servers.server-name]
command = &quot;npx&quot;
args = [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;mcp-server&quot;]
env = { &quot;API_KEY&quot; = &quot;value&quot; }
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; It is somewhat experimental, but the Codex CLI can also be run as an MCP _server_ via `codex mcp`. If you launch it with an MCP client such as `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector codex mcp` and send it a `tools/list` request, you will see that there is only one tool, `codex`, that accepts a grab-bag of inputs, including a catch-all `config` map for anything you might want to override. Feel free to play around with it and provide feedback via GitHub issues.

## Tracing / verbose logging

Because Codex is written in Rust, it honors the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to configure its logging behavior.

The TUI defaults to `RUST_LOG=codex_core=info,codex_tui=info` and log messages are written to `~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log`, so you can leave the following running in a separate terminal to monitor log messages as they are written:

```
tail -F ~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log
```

By comparison, the non-interactive mode (`codex exec`) defaults to `RUST_LOG=error`, but messages are printed inline, so there is no need to monitor a separate file.

See the Rust documentation on [`RUST_LOG`](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging) for more information on the configuration options.

## Installation

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install Codex CLI using your preferred package manager.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

From `brew` (recommended, downloads only the binary for your platform):

```bash
brew install codex
```

From `npm` (generally more readily available, but downloads binaries for all supported platforms):

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
```

Or go to the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest) and download the appropriate binary for your platform.

Admittedly, each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

### DotSlash

The GitHub Release also contains a [DotSlash](https://dotslash-cli.com/) file for the Codex CLI named `codex`. Using a DotSlash file makes it possible to make a lightweight commit to source control to ensure all contributors use the same version of an executable, regardless of what platform they use for development.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build from source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate to the root of the Cargo workspace.
git clone https://github.com/openai/codex.git
cd codex/codex-rs

# Install the Rust toolchain, if necessary.
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;
rustup component add rustfmt
rustup component add clippy

# Build Codex.
cargo build

# Launch the TUI with a sample prompt.
cargo run --bin codex -- &quot;explain this codebase to me&quot;

# After making changes, ensure the code is clean.
cargo fmt -- --config imports_granularity=Item
cargo clippy --tests

# Run the tests.
cargo test
```

&lt;/details&gt;

---

## Configuration

Codex supports a rich set of configuration options documented in [`codex-rs/config.md`](./codex-rs/config.md).

By default, Codex loads its configuration from `~/.codex/config.toml`.

Though `--config` can be used to set/override ad-hoc config values for individual invocations of `codex`.

## FAQ

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;OpenAI released a model called Codex in 2021 - is this related?&lt;/summary&gt;

In 2021, OpenAI released Codex, an AI system designed to generate code from natural language prompts. That original Codex model was deprecated as of March 2023 and is separate from the CLI tool.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Which models are supported?&lt;/summary&gt;

Any model available with [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses). The default is `o4-mini`, but pass `--model gpt-4.1` or set `model: gpt-4.1` in your config file to override.

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Why does &lt;code&gt;o3&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;o4-mini&lt;/code&gt; not work for me?&lt;/summary&gt;

It&#039;s possible that your [API account needs to be verified](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification) in order to start streaming responses and seeing chain of thought summaries from the API. If you&#039;re still running into issues, please let us know!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do I stop Codex from editing my files?&lt;/summary&gt;

Codex runs model-generated commands in a sandbox. If a proposed command or file change doesn&#039;t look right, you can simply type **n** to deny the command or give the model feedback.

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Does it work on Windows?&lt;/summary&gt;

Not directly. It requires [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) - Codex has been

RisingWave is a real-time event streaming platform designed to offer the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;simplest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;most cost-effective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; way to &lt;b&gt;process&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;analyze&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;manage&lt;/b&gt; real-time event data — with built-in support for the [Apache Iceberg™](https://iceberg.apache.org/) open table format. It provides both a Postgres-compatible [SQL interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) and a DataFrame-style [Python interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/python-sdk/intro).

RisingWave can &lt;b&gt;ingest&lt;/b&gt; millions of events per second, continuously &lt;b&gt;join and analyze&lt;/b&gt; live streams with historical data, &lt;b&gt;serve&lt;/b&gt; ad-hoc queries at low latency, and &lt;b&gt;persist&lt;/b&gt; fresh, consistent results to Apache Iceberg™ or any other downstream system.

## Try it out in 60 seconds

Install RisingWave standalone mode:
```shell
curl -L https://risingwave.com/sh | sh
```

To learn about other installation options, such as using a Docker image, see [Quick Start](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/get-started/).

## Stream, Store, and Query — All in One

RisingWave delivers a full **end-to-end streaming data platform** — combining real-time processing with built-in storage and open-format persistence.

It supports:

* **Ingestion:** Ingest millions of events per second from streaming and batch sources.
* **Stream processing:** Perform real-time incremental processing to join and analyze live data with historical tables.
* **Delivery:** Deliver fresh, consistent results to data lakes (e.g., Apache Iceberg™) or any destination.

What sets RisingWave apart is its integrated storage engine:

* **Online serving:** Row-based storage optimized for point and range queries with single-digit millisecond latency.
* **Offline persistence:** Built-in Apache Iceberg™ integration for low-cost, durable storage with open access for external query engines.

With RisingWave, real-time data isn’t just processed — it’s stored, queried, and shared across your entire stack.

## Key design decisions

RisingWave is designed to be easier to use and more cost-efficient:

### PostgreSQL compatibility

* **Seamless integration:** Connects via the PostgreSQL wire protocol, working with psql, JDBC, and any Postgres tool.
* **Expressive SQL:** Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data with a familiar SQL dialect.
* **No manual state tuning:** Eliminates complex state management configurations.

### S3 as primary storage

RisingWave stores tables, materialized views, and internal states of stream processing jobs in S3 (or equivalent object storage), providing:
- **High performance:** Optimized for complex queries, including joins and time windowing.
- **Fast recovery:** Restores from system failures within seconds.
- **[Dynamic scaling](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/k8s-cluster-scaling):** Instantly adjusts resources to handle workload spikes.

### Elastic disk cache

Beyond caching hot data in memory, RisingWave supports [**elastic disk cache**](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/disk-cache), a powerful performance optimization that uses local disks or EBS for efficient data caching. This minimizes access to S3, lowering processing latency and cutting S3 access costs.

### Apache Iceberg™ native support
RisingWave [**natively integrates with Apache Iceberg™**](https://docs.risingwave.com/iceberg/overview), enabling continuous ingestion of streaming data into Iceberg tables. It can also read directly from Iceberg, perform automatic compaction, and maintain table health over time. Since Iceberg is an open table format, results are accessible by other query engines — making storage not only cost-efficient, but interoperable by design.

## In what use cases does RisingWave excel?
RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Streaming analytics**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Event-driven applications**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.

## Versioning and Release Cycle

Tinymist&#039;s versions follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme, in format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Besides, tinymist follows special rules for the version number:

- If a version is suffixed with `-rcN` (&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;assets/images/introduction/frame_0.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/introduction/frame_1.svg&quot; alt=&quot;typst-frame&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;), e.g. `0.11.0-rc1` and `0.12.1-rc1`, it means this version is a release candidate. It is used to test publish script and E2E functionalities. These versions will not be published to the marketplace.
- If the `PATCH` number is odd, e.g. `0.11.1` and `0.12.3`, it means this version is a nightly release. The nightly release will use both [tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/main) and [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst/tree/main) at **main branch**. They will be published as prerelease version to the marketplace. Note that in nightly releases, we change `#sys.version` to the next minor release to help develop documents with nightly features. For example, in tinymist nightly v0.12.1 or v0.12.3, the `#sys.version` is changed to `version(0, 13, 0)`.
- Otherwise, if the `PATCH` number is even, e.g. `0.11.0` and `0.12.2`, it means this version is a regular release. The regular release will always use the recent stable version of tinymist and typst.

The release cycle is as follows:

- If there is a typst version update, a new major or minor version will be released intermediately. This means tinymist will always align the minor version with typst.
- If there is at least a bug or feature added this week, a new patch version will be released.

## Installing Regular/Nightly Prebuilds from GitHub

Note: if you are not knowing what is a regular/nightly release, please don&#039;t follow this section.

Besides published releases specific for each editors, you can also download the latest regular/nightly prebuilts from GitHub and install them manually.

- Regular prebuilts can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/releases).
- Nightly prebuilts can be found in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/actions).
  - (Suggested) Use the [tinymist-nightly-installer](https://github.com/hongjr03/tinymist-nightly-installer) to install the nightly prebuilts automatically.
    - Unix (Bash):
      ```bash
      curl -sSL https://github.com/hongjr03/tinymist-nightly-installer/releases/latest/download/run.sh | bash
      ```
    - Windows (PowerShell):
      ```bash
      iwr https://github.com/hongjr03/tinymist-nightly-installer/releases/latest/download/run.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
      ```
  - The prebuilts for other revisions can also be found manually. For example, if you are seeking a nightly release for the featured [PR: build: bump version to 0.11.17-rc1](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/468), you could click and go to the [action page](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/actions/runs/10120639466) run for the related commits and download the artifacts.

To install extension file (the file with `.vsix` extension) manually, please &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl+Shift+X&lt;/kbd&gt; in the editor window and drop the downloaded vsix file into the opened extensions view.

## Roadmap

### Short Terms

To encourage contributions, we create many [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pulls) in draft to navigate short-term plans. They give you a hint of what or where to start in this large repository.

### Long Terms

We are planning to implement the following features in typst v0.14.0 or spare time in weekend:

- Type checking: complete the type checker.
- Periscope renderer: It is disabled since vscode reject to render SVGs containing foreignObjects.
- Inlay hint: It is disabled _by default_ because of performance issues.
- Find references of dictionary fields and named function arguments.
- Improve symbol view&#039;s appearance.
- Improve package view.
  - Navigate to symbols by clicking on the symbol name in the view.
  - Automatically locate the symbol item in the view when viewing local documentation.
  - Remember the recently invoked package commands, e.g. &quot;Open Docs of @preview/cetz:0.3.1&quot;, &quot;Open directory of @preview/touying:0.5.3&quot;.
- Improve label view.
  - Group labels.
  - Search labels.
  - Keep (persist) group preferences.
- Improve Typst Preview.
  - Pin drop-down: Set the file to preview in the drop-down for clients that doesn&#039;t support passing arguments to the preview command.
  - Render in web worker (another thread) to reduce overhead on the electron&#039;s main thread.
- Spell checking: There is already a branch but no suitable (default) spell checking library is found.
  - [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) is great for typst. [harper](https://github.com/Automattic/harper) looks promise.

If you are interested by any above features, please feel free to send Issues to discuss or PRs to implement to [GitHub.](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist)

**ntsc-rs** is a video effect which emulates NTSC and VHS video artifacts. It can be used as an After Effects, Premiere, or OpenFX plugin, or as a standalone application.

![Screenshot of the ntsc-rs standalone application](./docs/img/appdemo.png)

## Download and Install

The latest version of ntsc-rs can be downloaded from [the releases page](https://github.com/valadaptive/ntsc-rs/releases).

After downloading, [read the documentation for how to run it](https://ntsc.rs/docs/standalone-installation/). In particular, ntsc-rs will not work properly on Linux unless you install all of the GStreamer packages listed in the documentation.

## More information

ntsc-rs is a rough Rust port of [ntscqt](https://github.com/JargeZ/ntscqt), a PyQt-based GUI for [ntsc](https://github.com/zhuker/ntsc), itself a Python port of [composite-video-simulator](https://github.com/joncampbell123/composite-video-simulator). Reimplementing the image processing in multithreaded Rust allows it to run at (mostly) real-time speeds.

It&#039;s not an exact port--some processing passes have visibly different results, and some new ones have been added.

# Time-aware multimodal data stack and visualizations
Rerun is building the multimodal data stack to model, ingest, store, query and view robotics-style data.
It&#039;s used in areas like robotics, spatial and embodied AI, generative media, industrial processing, simulation, security, and health.

Rerun is easy to use!
Use the Rerun SDK (available for C++, Python and Rust) to log data like images, tensors, point clouds, and text.
Logs are streamed to the Rerun Viewer for live visualization or to file for later use.
You can also query the logged data through [our dataframe API](https://rerun.io/docs/howto/dataframe-api).

[Get started](#getting-started) in minutes – no account needed.

* [Run the Rerun Viewer in your browser](https://www.rerun.io/viewer)
* [Read about what Rerun is and who it is for](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-rerun)

### A short taste
```py
import rerun as rr  # pip install rerun-sdk

rr.init(&quot;rerun_example_app&quot;)

rr.spawn()  # Spawn a child process with a viewer and connect
# rr.save(&quot;recording.rrd&quot;)  # Stream all logs to disk
# rr.connect_grpc()  # Connect to a remote viewer

# Associate subsequent data with 42 on the “frame” timeline
rr.set_time(&quot;frame&quot;, sequence=42)

# Log colored 3D points to the entity at `path/to/points`
rr.log(&quot;path/to/points&quot;, rr.Points3D(positions, colors=colors))
…
```

&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting started
* [**C++**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/cpp)
* [**Python**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/python): `pip install rerun-sdk` or on [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/rerun-sdk-feedstock)
* [**Rust**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/rust): `cargo add rerun`

### Installing the Rerun Viewer binary
To stream log data over the network or load our `.rrd` data files you also need the `rerun` binary.
It can be installed with `pip install rerun-sdk` or with `cargo install rerun-cli --locked --features nasm` (see note below).
Note that only the Python SDK comes bundled with the Viewer whereas C++ &amp; Rust always rely on a separate install.

**Note**: the `nasm` Cargo feature requires the [`nasm`](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) CLI to be installed and available in your path.
Alternatively, you may skip enabling this feature, but this may result in inferior video decoding performance.

You should now be able to run `rerun --help` in any terminal.

## Status
We are in active development.
There are many features we want to add, and the API is still evolving.
_Expect breaking changes!_

Some shortcomings:
* [The viewer slows down when there are too many entities](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/7115)
* [We don&#039;t support transparency yet](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1611)
* The data you want to visualize must fit in RAM
  - See &lt;https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/limit-ram&gt; for how to bound memory use.
  - We plan on having a disk-based data store some time in the future.
* [Multi-million point clouds can be slow](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1136)


## What is Rerun for?

Rerun is built to help you understand and improve complex processes that include rich multimodal data, like 2D, 3D, text, time series, tensors, etc.
It is used in many industries, including robotics, simulation, computer vision,
or anything that involves a lot of sensors or other signals that evolve over time.

### Example use case
Say you&#039;re building a vacuum cleaning robot and it keeps running into walls. Why is it doing that? You need some tool to debug it, but a normal debugger isn&#039;t gonna be helpful. Similarly, just logging text won&#039;t be very helpful either. The robot may log &quot;Going through doorway&quot; but that won&#039;t explain why it thinks the wall is a door.

What you need is a visual and temporal debugger, that can log all the different representations of the world the robots holds in its little head, such as:

* RGB camera feed
* depth images
* lidar scan
* segmentation image (how the robot interprets what it sees)
* its 3D map of the apartment
* all the objects the robot has detected (or thinks it has detected), as 3D shapes in the 3D map
* its confidence in its prediction
* etc

You also want to see how all these streams of data evolve over time so you can go back and pinpoint exactly what went wrong, when and why.

Maybe it turns out that a glare from the sun hit one of the sensors in the wrong way, confusing the segmentation network leading to bad object detection. Or maybe it was a bug in the lidar scanning code. Or maybe the robot thought it was somewhere else in the apartment, because its odometry was broken. Or it could be one of a thousand other things. Rerun will help you find out!

But seeing the world from the point of the view of the robot is not just for debugging - it will also give you ideas on how to improve the algorithms, new test cases to set up, or datasets to collect. It will also let you explain the brains of the robot to your colleagues, boss, and customers. And so on. Seeing is believing, and an image is worth a thousand words, and multimodal temporal logging is worth a thousand images :)

While seeing and understanding your data is core to making progress in robotics, there is one more thing:
You can also use the data you collected for visualization to create new datasets for training and evaluating the models and algorithms that run on your robot.
Rerun provides query APIs to make it easy to extract clean datasets from your recording for exactly that purpose.

Of course, Rerun is useful for much more than just robots. Any time you have any form of sensors, or 2D or 3D state evolving over time, Rerun is a great tool.


## Business model
Rerun uses an open-core model. Everything in this repository will stay open source and free (both as in beer and as in freedom).

We are also building a commercial data platform.
Right now that is only available for a few select design partners.
[Click here if you&#039;re interested](https://rerun.io/pricing).

The Rerun open source project targets the needs of individual developers.
The commercial product targets the needs specific to teams that build and run computer vision and robotics products.
