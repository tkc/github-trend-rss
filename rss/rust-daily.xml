## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust&#039;s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on
correctly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
&gt; the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
&gt; We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

Install optional dependencies as &#039;extras&#039; for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):

```bash
pip install -U &quot;nautilus_trader[docker,ib]&quot;
```

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |

**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.
Skipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, in

**The vector database that gets smarter the more you use it — and now ships as a cognitive container.**

```bash
npx ruvector
```

Most vector databases are static — they store embeddings and search them. That&#039;s it. RuVector is different: it learns from every query, runs LLMs locally, scales horizontally, boots as a Linux microservice from a single file, and costs nothing to operate.

| | Pinecone/Weaviate | RuVector |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 **Search improves over time** | ❌ | ✅ The more you search, the better results get |
| 🤖 **Run LLMs locally** | ❌ | ✅ Run AI models on your own machine for free |
| 🔗 **Graph queries** | ❌ | ✅ Ask questions about relationships between data |
| 📚 **Self-learning** | ❌ | ✅ System watches what works and gets smarter |
| 🚀 **Self-booting microservice** | ❌ | ✅ [One file boots into a running service](./crates/rvf/README.md) in 125 ms |
| ⚡ **Real-time graph updates** | ❌ Must rebuild | ✅ Update connections instantly, no downtime |
| 📦 **Single-file deployment** | ❌ Server required | ✅ One file — copy it anywhere and it just works |
| 🔐 **Tamper-proof audit trail** | ❌ | ✅ Every operation is cryptographically recorded |
| 🌐 **Works offline** | ❌ | ✅ Runs in browsers, phones, IoT, and bare metal |
| 💰 **Cost** | Per-query pricing | ✅ Free forever — open source (MIT) |
| 📈 **Scales horizontally** | 💰 Paid tiers | ✅ Add nodes freely, no per-vector fees |
| 🌿 **Git-like branching** | ❌ | ✅ Branch your data like code — only changes are copied |

**One package. Everything included:** vector search, graph queries, GNN learning, distributed clustering, local LLMs, 40+ attention mechanisms, cognitive containers ([RVF](./crates/rvf/README.md) — self-booting `.rvf` files with eBPF, witness chains, and COW branching), and WASM support.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rvDNA&lt;/strong&gt; — AI-native genomic diagnostics, instant and available to everyone&lt;/summary&gt;

**Using AI to make the world a healthier place.** rvDNA puts genomic diagnostics on any device — a phone, a laptop, a browser tab — in 12 milliseconds. No cloud, no GPU, no subscription. Private by default.

```bash
cargo add rvdna              # Rust
npm install @ruvector/rvdna  # JavaScript / TypeScript
```

| What It Does | How |
|---|---|
| Find mutations (sickle cell, cancer) | Bayesian variant calling, 155 ns/SNP |
| Translate DNA to protein | Full codon table + GNN contact graphs |
| Predict biological age | Horvath clock, 353 CpG sites |
| Recommend drug doses | CYP2D6 star alleles + CPIC guidelines |
| Search genomes by similarity | HNSW k-mer vectors, O(log N) |
| Store pre-computed AI features | `.rvdna` binary format — open and instant |

- **Rust crate**: [crates.io/crates/rvdna](https://crates.io/crates/rvdna)
- **npm package**: [@ruvector/rvdna](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/rvdna) (NAPI-RS native + JS fallback)
- **Source**: [examples/dna](./examples/dna)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RVF Cognitive Containers&lt;/strong&gt; — One file that stores, boots, and proves everything&lt;/summary&gt;

**[RVF (RuVector Format)](./crates/rvf/README.md)** is a universal binary substrate that merges database, model, graph engine, kernel, and attestation into a single deployable file. A `.rvf` file can store vector embeddings, carry LoRA adapter deltas, embed GNN graph state, include a bootable Linux microkernel, run queries in a 5.5 KB WASM runtime, and prove every operation through a cryptographic witness chain — all in one file that runs anywhere from a browser to bare metal.

This is not a database format. It is an **executable knowledge unit**.

```bash
cargo install rvf-cli                          # CLI tool
cargo add rvf-runtime                          # Rust library
npm install @ruvector/rvf                      # TypeScript SDK
npx @ruvector/rvf-mcp-server --transport stdio # MCP server for AI agents
```

| What It Does | How |
|---|---|
| Self-boot as a microservice | Real Linux kernel in the file, boots in 125 ms on QEMU/KVM |
| Hardware-speed lookups | eBPF programs (XDP, TC, socket filter) bypass userspace entirely |
| Run in any browser | 5.5 KB WASM runtime, zero backend |
| Git-like branching | COW at cluster granularity — 1M vectors, 100 edits = ~2.5 MB child |
| Tamper-evident audit | Hash-linked witness chain for every insert, query, and deletion |
| Post-quantum signatures | ML-DSA-65 and Ed25519 signing on every segment |
| DNA-style lineage | Parent/child derivation chains with cryptographic verification |
| 20 segment types | VEC, INDEX, KERNEL, EBPF, WASM, COW_MAP, WITNESS, CRYPTO, and 12 more |

## How the GNN Works

Traditional vector search:
```
Query → HNSW Index → Top K Results
```

RuVector with GNN:
```
Query → HNSW Index → GNN Layer → Enhanced Results
                ↑                      │
                └──── learns from ─────┘
```

The GNN layer:
1. Takes your query and its nearest neighbors
2. Applies multi-head attention to weigh which neighbors matter
3. Updates representations based on graph structure
4. Returns better-ranked results

Over time, frequently-accessed paths get reinforced, making common queries faster and more accurate.

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Chroma allows you to store these vectors or embeddings and search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

# 🛠️ Installation

Our plan is to provide installers for the supported operating systems or common package installers.
Unfortunately we have serious Problems with Tauri and creating installers. There are some installers
for linux under `dist-builds`. In the future there will be ready to go packages for macOS, Linux and
Windows until then please refer to the compilation from source for your computer.

## Installation from source

### Prerequisites for installing from source

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (stable version)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (stable version)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/) (version &gt;2.4.0)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) (comes with Rust)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) (comes with Tauri CLI)

Other required dependencies are installed automatically by the Tauri CLI. If they are not please
contact us.

### Install with compiling from source

Note that on macOS you need XCode installed with the build tools.

```bash
# Install Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli # The version should be &gt;2.4.0 if not already installed

# Build for production
cargo tauri build
```

Go into the build directory and run the created binary. The binary is located in
`FileExplorer/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`. The name of the binary is `file-explorer` or

### 🐧 Linux

Under Linux the given command generates an `.deb`, `.rpm`, `AppImage` in the
`FileExplorer/src-tauri/target/release/bundle` folder. Select the one which fits your distribution.
Either run the AppImage, Binary or install the `.deb` or `.rpm` package.

#### For the `AppImage`

```bash
#Make sure the image is runnable
chmod +x yourapp-x.y.z.AppImage
#Run the image. After that it should behaving like a native application
./yourapp-x.y.z.AppImage
```

Recommended is to use the binary created in `FileExplorer/src-tauri/target/release/src-tauri`. Give
it executable permissions and then run it from the terminal. You can also put it into your user
binaries folder, e.g. `~/bin`, and add it to your PATH variable.

### 🍎 macOS

```bash
# Install Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli # The version should be &gt;2.4.0 if not already installed

# Build for production
cargo tauri build
```

Tauri creates an `.dmg` or `.app` bundle under the folder
`FileExplorer/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/`. Recommended is to use the binary created in
`FileExplorer/src-tauri/target/release/src-tauri`. Give it executable permissions and then run it
from the terminal. You can also put it into your user binaries folder, e.g. `~/bin`, and add it to
your PATH variable.

### 🪟 Windows

This generates an installer for your system, which lays in
`FileExplorer/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/`. There should be an `.exe` or `.msi` which is
called `file-explorer`. To install it you need to double click the file and install like any other
application. Then you can completely remove the `FileExplorer` folder.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli # The version should be &gt;2.4.0

# Build for production
cargo tauri build

# Run the development server
cargo tauri dev
```

### Testing and Development Commands

The project uses feature flags for different configurations:

```bash
# Run all tests including long-running ones
cargo test --features full

# Run with benchmark features
cargo test --features benchmarks

# Enable all logging during tests
cargo test --features log-all
```

Available feature combinations:
- `full` - All features including long tests, benchmarks, and file opening
- `log-search` - Enable search progress and error logging
- `log-index` - Enable indexing progress and error logging

## 📄 History

The Explorer was started as a project from the youtuber
[Connaticus](https://www.youtube.com/@conaticus). He documented parts of his development journey
online in two Videos:
[I Made a FAST File Explorer](https://youtu.be/Z60f2g-COJY?si=PHWogkV1R_wD8dza) and
[How I RUINED My Rust Project](https://youtu.be/4wdAZQROc4A?si=9ksfN2TcxdDI41BD).

Lots of changes were made in the course of the InformatiCup from the year 2025. It is a competition
in Germany. The given task was to contribute to existing open source projects. The team members were
[Marco Brandt](https://github.com/CodeMarco05), [Daniel Schatz](https://github.com/xd1i0),
[Lauritz Wiebusch](https://github.com/wielauritz), [Sören Panten](https://github.com/SPKonig). The
repo can be found under [FileExplorer](https://github.com/CodeMarco05/FileExplorer).

## ⚡ Performance

This file explorer emphasizes extreme performance with benchmarks showing significant improvements
over native solutions (tested on 170,000 paths):

| Operation   | Fast File Explorer | Windows Explorer |
| ----------- |:------------------:| :--------------: |
| File search |       ~15ms        |   3min 45sec     |

### Technical Implementation
- **Multiple Search Algorithms**: Fast fuzzy search, ART (Adaptive Radix Tree)
- **LRU Caching**: Intelligent caching for search results
- **Rust Backend**: Memory-safe, zero-cost abstractions
- **Modular Architecture**: Command-based system with feature flags

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application uses several configuration files:

- `src-tauri/config/settings.json` - Application settings
- `src-tauri/config/meta_data.json` - Metadata configuration  
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Tauri application configuration
- `package.json` - Frontend dependencies and scripts

make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

## About

Turso Database is an in-process SQL database written in Rust, compatible with SQLite.

&gt; **⚠️ Warning:** This software is in BETA. It may still contain bugs and unexpected behavior. Use caution with production data and ensure you have backups.

## Features and Roadmap

* **SQLite compatibility** for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API [see [document](COMPAT.md) for details]
* **Change data capture (CDC)** for real-time tracking of database changes.
* **Multi-language support** for
  * [Go](bindings/go)
  * [JavaScript](bindings/javascript)
  * [Java](bindings/java)
  * [Python](bindings/python)
  * [Rust](bindings/rust)
  * [WebAssembly](bindings/javascript)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **Cross-platform** support for Linux, macOS, Windows and browsers (through WebAssembly)
* **Vector support** support including exact search and vector manipulation
* **Improved schema management** including extended `ALTER` support and faster schema changes.

The database has the following experimental features:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput using multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
* **Encryption at rest** for protecting the data locally.
* **Incremental computation** using DBSP for incremental view maintenance and query subscriptions.
* **Full-Text-Search** powered by the awesome [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) library

The following features are on our current roadmap:

* **Vector indexing** for fast approximate vector search, similar to [libSQL vector search](https://turso.tech/vector).

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the interactive shell:

```shell
$ tursodb
```

This will start the Turso interactive shell where you can execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```

If you like docker, we got you covered. Simply run this in the root folder:

```bash
make docker-cli-build &amp;&amp; \
make docker-cli-run
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/database
```

Example usage:

```js
import { connect } from &#039;@tursodatabase/database&#039;;

const db = await connect(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
uv pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦫 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
go get turso.tech/database/tursogo
go install turso.tech/database/tursogo
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;turso.tech/database/tursogo&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;turso&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;☕️ Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Turso Database into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Turso Database with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🤖 MCP Server Mode&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


The Turso CLI includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your databases.

Start the MCP server with:

```shell
tursodb your_database.db --mcp
```

### Configuration

Add Turso to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;turso&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/.turso/tursodb&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/your/database.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides nine tools for database interaction:

1. **`open_database`** - Open a new database
2. **`current_database`** - Describe the current database
3. **`list_tables`** - List all tables in the database
4. **`describe_table`** - Describe the structure of a specific table
5. **`execute_query`** - Execute read-only SELECT queries
6. **`insert_data`** - Insert new data into tables
7. **`update_data`** - Update existing data in tables
8. **`delete_data`** - Delete data from tables
9. **`schema_change`** - Execute schema modification statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant:

- &quot;Show me all tables in the database&quot;
- &quot;What&#039;s the schema for the users table?&quot;
- &quot;Find all posts with more than 100 upvotes&quot;
- &quot;Insert a new user with name &#039;Alice&#039; and email &#039;alice@example.com&#039;&quot;

### MCP Clients

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Code&lt;/summary&gt;

If you&#039;re using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), you can easily connect to your Turso MCP server using the built-in MCP management commands:

#### Quick Setup

1. **Add the MCP server** to Claude Code:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to activate the connection

3. **Start querying** your database through natural language!

#### Command Breakdown

```bash
claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
#              ↑            ↑       ↑                           ↑
#              |            |       |                           |
#              Name         |       Database path               MCP flag
#                          Separator
```

- **`my-database`** - Choose any name for your MCP server
- **`--`** - Required separator between Claude options and your command
- **`tursodb`** - The Turso database CLI
- **`./path/to/your/database.db`** - Path to your SQLite database file
- **`--mcp`** - Enables MCP server mode

#### Example Usage

```bash
# For a local project database
cd /your/project
claude mcp add my-project-db -- tursodb ./data/app.db --mcp

# For an absolute path
claude mcp add analytics-db -- tursodb /Users/you/databases/analytics.db --mcp

# For a specific project (local scope)
claude mcp add project-db --local -- tursodb ./database.db --mcp
```

#### Managing MCP Servers

```bash
# List all configured MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Get details about a specific server
claude mcp get my-database

# Remove an MCP server
claude mcp remove my-database
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Desktop&lt;/summary&gt;

For Claude Desktop, add the configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;turso&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/.turso/tursodb&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;./path/to/your/database.db.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cursor&lt;/summary&gt;

For Cursor, configure MCP in your settings:

1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to Extensions → MCP
3. Add a new server with:
   - **Name**: `turso`
   - **Command**: `/path/to/.turso/tursodb`
   - **Args**: `[&quot;./path/to/your/database.db.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]`

Alternatively, you can add it to your Cursor configuration file directly.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Direct JSON-RPC Usage

The MCP server runs as a single process that handles multiple JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout. Here&#039;s how to interact with it directly:

#### Example with In-Memory Database

```bash
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;schema_change&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 4, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;insert_data&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;Alice&#039;, &#039;alice@example.com&#039;)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;execute_query&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;}}}
EOF
```

#### Example with Existing Database

```bash
# Working with an existing database file
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb mydb.db --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
EOF
```

&lt;/details&gt;

We&#039;d love to have you contribute to Turso Database! Please check out the [contribution guide] to get started.

### Found a data corruption bug? Get up to $1,000.00

SQLite is loved because it is the most reliable database in the world. The next evolution of SQLite has
to match or surpass this level of reliability. Turso is built with [Deterministic Simulation Testing](testing/simulator/README.md/)
from the ground up, and is also tested by [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com).

Even during Alpha, if you find a bug that leads to a data corruption and demonstrate
how our simulator failed to catch it, you can get up to $1,000.00. As the project matures we will
increase the size of the prize, and the scope of the bugs.

List of rewarded cases:

* B-Tree interior cell replacement issue in btrees with depth &gt;=3 ([#2106](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/issues/2106))
* Don&#039;t allow autovacuum to be flipped on non-empty databases ([#3830](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/pull/3830))

More details [here](https://turso.algora.io).

Turso core staff are not eligible.

## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

## Usage

**Check out our [online demo](https://rustpython.github.io/demo/) running on WebAssembly.**

RustPython requires Rust latest stable version (e.g 1.67.1 at February 7th 2023). If you don&#039;t
currently have Rust installed on your system you can do so by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

To check the version of Rust you&#039;re currently running, use `rustc --version`. If you wish to update,
`rustup update stable` will update your Rust installation to the most recent stable release.

To build RustPython locally, first, clone the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
```

RustPython uses symlinks to manage python libraries in `Lib/`. If on windows, running the following helps:
```bash
git config core.symlinks true
```

Then you can change into the RustPython directory and run the demo (Note: `--release` is
needed to prevent stack overflow on Windows):

```bash
$ cd RustPython
$ cargo run --release demo_closures.py
Hello, RustPython!
```

Or use the interactive shell:

```bash
$ cargo run --release
Welcome to rustpython
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4
```

NOTE: For windows users, please set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` environment variable as `Lib` path in project directory.
(e.g. When RustPython directory is `C:\RustPython`, set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` as `C:\RustPython\Lib`)

You can also install and run RustPython with the following:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython rustpython
$ rustpython
Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

### venv

Because RustPython currently doesn&#039;t provide a well-packaged installation, using venv helps to use pip easier.

```sh
$ rustpython -m venv &lt;your_env_name&gt;
$ . &lt;your_env_name&gt;/bin/activate
$ python # now `python` is the alias of the RustPython for the new env
```

### PIP

If you&#039;d like to make https requests, you can enable the `ssl` feature, which
also lets you install the `pip` package manager. Note that on Windows, you may
need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the `ssl-vendor` feature instead,
which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and `make`.
OpenSSL version 3 is expected and tested in CI. Older versions may not work.

Once you&#039;ve installed rustpython with SSL support, you can install pip by
running:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
rustpython --install-pip
```

You can also install RustPython through the `conda` package manager, though
this isn&#039;t officially supported and may be out of date:

```bash
conda install rustpython -c conda-forge
rustpython
```

### SSL provider

For HTTPS requests, `ssl-rustls` feature is enabled by default. You can replace it with `ssl-openssl` feature if your environment requires OpenSSL.
Note that to use OpenSSL on Windows, you may need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the `ssl-vendor` feature instead,
which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and `make`.
OpenSSL version 3 is expected and tested in CI. Older versions may not work.

### WASI

You can compile RustPython to a standalone WebAssembly WASI module so it can run anywhere.

Build

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --no-default-features --features freeze-stdlib,stdlib --release
```

Run by wasmer

```bash
wasmer run --dir `pwd` -- target/wasm32-wasip1/release/rustpython.wasm `pwd`/extra_tests/snippets/stdlib_random.py
```

Run by wapm

```bash
$ wapm install rustpython
$ wapm run rustpython
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4
```

#### Building the WASI file

You can build the WebAssembly WASI file with:

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1 --features=&quot;freeze-stdlib&quot;
```

&gt; Note: we use the `freeze-stdlib` to include the standard library inside the binary. You also have to run once `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`.

### JIT (Just in time) compiler

RustPython has a **very** experimental JIT compiler that compile python functions into native code.

#### Building

By default the JIT compiler isn&#039;t enabled, it&#039;s enabled with the `jit` cargo feature.

```bash
cargo run --features jit
```

This requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and clang to be installed.

#### Using

To compile a function, call `__jit__()` on it.

```python
def foo():
    a = 5
    return 10 + a

foo.__jit__()  # this will compile foo to native code and subsequent calls will execute that native code
assert foo() == 15
```

## Embedding RustPython into your Rust Applications

Interested in exposing Python scripting in an application written in Rust,
perhaps to allow quickly tweaking logic where Rust&#039;s compile times would be inhibitive?
Then `examples/hello_embed.rs` and `examples/mini_repl.rs` may be of some assistance.

## Disclaimer

RustPython is in development, and while the interpreter certainly can be used
in interesting use cases like running Python in WASM and embedding into a Rust
project, do note that RustPython is not totally production-ready.

Contribution is more than welcome! See our contribution section for more
information on this.

## Conference videos

Checkout those talks on conferences:

- [FOSDEM 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJDY9ASuiLc)
- [EuroPython 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmio0JHy_Y)

## Use cases

Although RustPython is a fairly young project, a few people have used it to
make cool projects:

- [GreptimeDB](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb): an open-source, cloud-native, distributed time-series database. Using RustPython for embedded scripting.
- [pyckitup](https://github.com/pickitup247/pyckitup): a game engine written in
  rust.
- [Robot Rumble](https://github.com/robot-rumble/logic/): an arena-based AI competition platform
- [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/): an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust

## Goals

- Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings)
- A clean implementation without compatibility hacks

## Documentation

Currently along with other areas of the project, documentation is still in an
early phase.

You can read the [online documentation](https://docs.rs/rustpython) for the
latest release, or the [user guide](https://rustpython.github.io/docs/).

You can also generate documentation locally by running:

```shell
cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies
cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies
```

Documentation HTML files can then be found in the `target/doc` directory or you can append `--open` to the previous commands to
have the documentation open automatically on your default browser.

For a high level overview of the components, see the [architecture](architecture/architecture.md) document.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide
contributors through PRs or on Discord. Please refer to the
[development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) as well for tips on developments.

With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of
the best ways to get started are below:

Most tasks are listed in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues). Check issues
labeled with [good first issue](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) if you wish to start coding.

To enhance CPython compatibility, try to increase unittest coverage by checking this article: [How to contribute to RustPython by CPython unittest](https://rustpython.github.io/guideline/2020/04/04/how-to-contribute-by-cpython-unittest.html)

Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object
methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute.

You can also simply run `python -I scripts/whats_left.py` to assist in finding any unimplemented
method.

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

Tauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:

| Platform   | Versions                                                                                                        |

## Contributing

Before you start working on something, it&#039;s best to check if there is an existing issue first. It&#039;s also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

Thank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!

### Documentation

Documentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation in the Rust &amp; JS source code as much as possible. Check out the hosting repository for the documentation site for further information: &lt;https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs&gt;

**Krokiet** ((IPA: [ˈkrɔcɛt]), &quot;croquette&quot; in Polish) new generation GUI frontend, simple, multiplatform, fast and free app to remove unnecessary files from your computer.

![czkawka_logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41945903/102616149-66490400-4137-11eb-9cd6-813b2b070834.png)

**Czkawka** (_tch•kav•ka_ (IPA: [ˈʧ̑kafka]), &quot;hiccup&quot; in Polish) older gtk4 GUI frontend, superseded by Krokiet, but still receiving bugfix updates.

## Features

- Written in memory-safe Rust - almost 100% unsafe code free
- Amazingly fast - due to using more or less advanced algorithms and multithreading
- Free, Open Source without ads
- Multiplatform - runs on Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, x86, ARM, RISC-V and even Android
- Cache support - second and further scans should be much faster than the first one
- Easy to run, easy to compile - minimal runtime and build dependencies, portable version available
- CLI frontend - for easy automation
- GUI frontend - uses Slint or GTK 4 frameworks
- Core library - allows to reuse functionality in other apps
- No spying - Czkawka does not have access to the Internet, nor does it collect any user information or statistics
- Multilingual - support multiple languages like Polish, English or Italian
- Multiple tools to use:
    - Duplicates - Finds duplicates based on file name, size or hash
    - Empty Folders - Finds empty folders with the help of an advanced algorithm
    - Big Files - Finds the provided number of the biggest files in given location
    - Empty Files - Looks for empty files across the drive
    - Temporary Files - Finds temporary files
    - Similar Images - Finds images which are not exactly the same (different resolution, watermarks)
    - Similar Videos - Looks for visually similar videos
    - Same Music - Searches for similar music by tags or by reading content and comparing it
    - Invalid Symbolic Links - Shows symbolic links which point to non-existent files/directories
    - Broken Files - Finds files that are invalid or corrupted
    - Bad Extensions - Lists files whose content not match with their extension
    - Exif Remover - Removes Exif metadata from various file types
    - Video Optimizer - Crops from static parts and converts videos to more efficient formats
    - Bad Names - Finds files with names that may be not wanted (e.g., containing special characters)

## Usage, installation, compilation, requirements, license

Each tool uses different technologies, so you can find instructions for each of them in the appropriate file:

- [Krokiet GUI (Slint frontend)](krokiet/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka GUI (GTK frontend)](czkawka_gui/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka CLI](czkawka_cli/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka Core](czkawka_core/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;

## Comparison to other tools

Bleachbit is a master at finding and removing temporary files, while Czkawka only finds the most basic ones. So these
two apps shouldn&#039;t be compared directly or be considered as an alternative to one another.

In this comparison remember, that even if app have same features they may work different(e.g. one app may have more
options to choose than other).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Few small commits added recently and last version released in 2023&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; Czkawka GTK is in maintenance mode receiving only bugfixes&lt;/p&gt;

## Other apps

There are many similar applications to Czkawka on the Internet, which do some things better and some things worse:

### GUI

- [DupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) - Many options to customize; great photo compare tool
- [FSlint](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) - A little outdated, but still have some tools not available in Czkawka
- [AntiDupl.NET](https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl) - Shows a lot of metadata of compared images
- [Video Duplicate Finder](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder) - Finds similar videos(surprising, isn&#039;t it)

### CLI

Due to limited time, the biggest emphasis is on the GUI version so if you are looking for really good and feature-packed
console apps, then take a look at these:

- [Fclones](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones) - One of the fastest tools to find duplicates; it is written also in
  Rust
- [Rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint) - Nice console interface and also is feature packed
- [RdFind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind) - Fast, but written in C++ ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯


## Projects using Czkawka

Czkawka exposes its common functionality through a crate called **`czkawka_core`**, which can be reused by other projects.

It is written in Rust and is used by all Czkawka frontends (`czkawka_gui`, `czkawka_cli`, `krokiet`).

It is also used by external projects, such as:

- **Czkawka Tauri** - https://github.com/shixinhuang99/czkawka-tauri - A Tauri-based GUI frontend for Czkawka.
- **page-dewarp** – https://github.com/lmmx/page-dewarp - A library for dewarping document images using a cubic sheet model.

Bindings are also available for:

- **Python** – https://pypi.org/project/czkawka/

Some projects work as wrappers around `czkawka_cli`. Without directly depending on `czkawka_core`, they allow simple scanning and retrieving results in JSON format:

- **Schluckauf** – https://github.com/fadykuzman/schluckauf

## Thanks

Big thanks to Pádraig Brady, creator of fantastic FSlint, because without his work I wouldn&#039;t create this tool.

Thanks also to all the people who create patches for this program, create and fix translations, make it available on other systems, create videos,
articles about it etc.

Also, I really appreciate work of people that create crates on which Czkawka is based and for that I try to report bugs
to make it even better.

## Officially Supported Projects
Only this repository, [prebuild-binaries](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases), projects on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/czkawka_gui) and [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.qarmin.czkawka) are directly maintained by me.  

Czkawka does not have an official website, so do not trust any sites that claim to be the official one.  

If you use packages from unofficial sources, make sure they are safe.

Pyrefly is a type checker and language server for Python, which provides
lightning-fast type checking along with IDE features such as code navigation,
semantic highlighting, and code completion. It is available as a
[command-line tool](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/installation/) and an extension
for popular IDEs and editors such as
[VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly),
[Neovim](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/#neovim),
[Zed](https://zed.dev/extensions/pyrefly), and
[more](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/).

See the [Pyrefly website](https://pyrefly.org) for full documentation and how to
add Pyrefly to your editor of choice.

Currently under active development with known issues. Please open an issue if
you find bugs.

### Getting Started

- Try out pyrefly in your browser: [Sandbox](https://pyrefly.org/sandbox/)
- Get the command-line tool: `pip install pyrefly`
- Get the IDE Extension: [IDE installation page](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/)

### Key Features:

- Type Inference: Pyrefly infers types in most locations, apart from function
  parameters. It can infer types of variables and return types.
- Flow Types: Pyrefly can understand your program&#039;s control flow to refine
  static types.
- Incrementality: Pyrefly aims for large-scale incrementality at the module
  level, with optimized checking and parallelism.

## Getting Involved

If you have questions or would like to report a bug, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues).

See our
[contributing guide](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for information on how to contribute to Pyrefly.

Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Cf7mFQtW7W) to chat about Pyrefly
and types. This is also where we hold biweekly office hours.

## Choices

There are a number of choices when writing a Python type checker. We are taking
inspiration from [Pyre1](https://pyre-check.org/),
[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) and
[MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Some notable choices:

- We infer types in most locations, apart from parameters to functions. We do
  infer types of variables and return types. As an example,
  `def foo(x): return True` would result in something equivalent to had you
  written `def foo(x: Any) -&gt; bool: ...`.
- We attempt to infer the type of `[]` to however it is used first, then fix it
  after. For example `xs = []; xs.append(1); xs.append(&quot;&quot;)` will infer that
  `xs: List[int]` and then error on the final statement.
- We use flow types which refine static types, e.g. `x: int = 4` will both know
  that `x` has type `int`, but also that the immediately next usage of `x` will
  be aware the type is `Literal[4]`.
- We aim for large-scale incrementality (at the module level) and optimized
  checking with parallelism, aiming to use the advantages of Rust to keep the
  code a bit simpler.
- We expect large strongly connected components of modules, and do not attempt
  to take advantage of a DAG-shape in the source code.

## Code layout

Pyrefly is split into a number of crates (mostly under `crates/`):

- `pyrefly_util` are general purpose utilities, which have nothing to do with
  Python or type checking. Examples include IO wrappers, locking, command line
  helpers etc.
- `pyrefly_derive` are proc-macros for deriving traits such as `TypeEq` and
  `Visit`.
- `pyrefly_python` are Python utilities with no type-checking aspects, such as
  modelling modules or `sys.info`.
- `pyrefly_graph` provides utilities for indexing values and caching
  computations that may depend on each other.
- `pyrefly_bundled` are the third-party
  [typeshed stubs](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
- `pyrefly_config` defines the Pyrefly configuration, along with support for
  reading Mypy/Pyright configuration.
- `pyrefly_types` defines the Pyrefly type along with operations on it.
- `pyrefly_wasm` defines the sandbox code that compiles to WASM.
- `pyrefly` itself is the type checker and everything else.

## Design

There are many nuances of design that change on a regular basis. But the basic
substrate on which the checker is built involves three steps:

1. Figure out what each module exports. That requires solving all `import *`
   statements transitively.
2. For each module in isolation, convert it to bindings, dealing with all
   statements and scope information (both static and flow).
3. Solve those bindings, which may require the solutions of bindings in other
   modules.

If we encounter unknowable information (e.g. recursion) we use `Type::Var` to
insert placeholders which are filled in later.

For each module, we solve the steps sequentially and completely. In particular,
we do not try and solve a specific identifier first (like
[Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)), and do not use fine-grained
incrementality (like [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
using [Salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa)). Instead, we aim for raw
performance and a simpler module-centric design - there&#039;s no need to solve a
single binding in isolation if solving all bindings in a module is fast enough.

### Example of bindings

Given the program:

```python
1: x: int = 4
2: print(x)
```

We might produce the bindings:

- `define int@0` = `from builtins import int`
- `define x@1` = `4: int@0`
- `use x@2` = `x@1`
- `anon @2` = `print(x@2)`
- `export x` = `x@2`

Of note:

- The keys are things like `define` (the definition of something), `use` (a
  usage of a thing) and `anon` (a statement we need to type check, but don&#039;t
  care about the result of).
- In many cases the value of a key refers to other keys.
- Some keys are imported from other modules, via `export` keys and `import`
  values.
- In order to disambiguate identifiers we use the textual position at which they
  occur (in the example we&#039;ve used `@line`, but in reality it&#039;s the byte offset
  in the file).

### Example of `Var`

Given the program:

```python
1: x = 1
2: while test():
3:     x = x
4: print(x)
```

We end up with the bindings:

- `x@1` = `1`
- `x@3` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`
- `x@4` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`

The expression `phi` is the join point of the two values, e.g. `phi(int, str)`
would be `int | str`. We skip the distinction between `define` and `use`, since
it is not necessary for this example.

When solving `x@3` we encounter recursion. Operationally:

- We start solving `x@3`.
- That requires us to solve `x@1`.
- We solve `x@1` to be `Literal[1]`
- We start solving `x@3`. But we are currently solving `x@3`, so we invent a
  fresh `Var` (let&#039;s call it `?1`) and return that.
- We conclude that `x@3` must be `Literal[1] | ?1`.
- Since `?1` was introduced by `x@3` we record that `?1 = Literal[1] | ?1`. We
  can take the upper reachable bound of that and conclude that
  `?1 = Literal[1]`.
- We simplify `x@3` to just `Literal[1]`.

`wgpu` is a cross-platform, safe, pure-Rust graphics API. It runs natively on Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, and OpenGL; and on top of WebGL2 and WebGPU on wasm.

The API is based on the [WebGPU standard][webgpu], but is a fully native Rust library. It serves as the core of the WebGPU integration in Firefox, Servo, and Deno.

## Getting Started

See our examples online at &lt;https://wgpu.rs/examples/&gt;. You can see the Rust sources at [examples](examples) and run them directly with `cargo run --bin wgpu-examples &lt;example&gt;`.

### Learning `wgpu`

If you are new to `wgpu` and graphics programming, we recommend starting with [Learn Wgpu].
&lt;!-- Note, &quot;Learn Wgpu&quot; is using the capitalization style in their header, NOT our styling --&gt;

Additionally, [WebGPU Fundamentals] is a tutorial for WebGPU which is very similar to our API, minus differences between Rust and Javascript.

### Other Languages

To use wgpu in C or dozens of other languages, look at [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native). These are C bindings to wgpu and has an up-to-date list of libraries bringing support to other languages. 

[Learn WebGPU (for C++)] is a good resource for learning how to use wgpu-native from C++.

## Environment Variables

Testing, examples, and `::from_env()` methods use a standardized set of environment variables to control wgpu&#039;s behavior.

- `WGPU_BACKEND` with a comma-separated list of the backends you want to use (`vulkan`, `metal`, `dx12`, or `gl`).
- `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` with a case-insensitive substring of the name of the adapter you want to use (ex. `1080` will match `NVIDIA GeForce 1080ti`).
- `WGPU_DX12_COMPILER` with the DX12 shader compiler you wish to use (`dxc`, `static-dxc`, or `fxc`). Note that `dxc` requires `dxcompiler.dll` (min v1.8.2502) to be in the working directory, and `static-dxc` requires the `static-dxc` crate feature to be enabled. Otherwise, it will fall back to `fxc`.

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/index.html?search=env) for more environment variables.

When running the CTS, use the variables `DENO_WEBGPU_ADAPTER_NAME`, `DENO_WEBGPU_BACKEND`, `DENO_WEBGPU_POWER_PREFERENCE`.

## Repo Overview

For an overview of all the components in the gfx-rs ecosystem, see [the big picture](./docs/big-picture.png).

## MSRV policy

TL;DR: If you&#039;re using `wgpu`, our MSRV is **1.87**. If you&#039;re running our tests or examples, our MSRV is **1.93**.

We will avoid bumping the MSRV of `wgpu` without good reason, and such a change is considered breaking.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt; Specific Details &lt;/summary&gt;

Due to complex dependants, we have three MSRV policies:

- `wgpu`&#039;s MSRV is **1.87**
- `wgpu-core` (and hence `wgpu-hal`, `naga`, and `wgpu-types`)&#039;s MSRV is **1.87**.
- The rest of the workspace has an MSRV of **1.93**.

It is enforced on CI (in &quot;/.github/workflows/ci.yml&quot;) with the `WGPU_MSRV`, `CORE_MSRV`, and `REPO_MSRV` variables, respectively.
This version can only be upgraded in breaking releases, though we release a breaking version every three months.

The following rules apply:
- The `wgpu-core` crate should never require an MSRV ahead of Firefox&#039;s MSRV for nightly builds, as
determined by the value of `MINIMUM_RUST_VERSION` in [`python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py`][moz-msrv].
- The `wgpu` crate should never require an MSRV ahead of Servo&#039;s MSRV, as determined by the value of
their rust-version declaration in [`Cargo.toml`][servo-msrv]
- The repository MSRV should never require an MSRV higher than `stable - 3`. For example, if stable is
at 1.97, the repository MSRV should be no higher than 1.94. This is to allow people who are using a decently-updated
OS-provided rust to be able to build our repository. Consider cross checking with [NixOS][nixos-msrv], though this
is not required.

[moz-msrv]: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py
[servo-msrv]: https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/main/Cargo.toml#L23

## Tracking the WebGPU and WGSL draft specifications

The `wgpu` crate is meant to be an idiomatic Rust translation of the [WebGPU API][webgpu spec].
That specification, along with its shading language, [WGSL][wgsl spec],
are both still in the &quot;Working Draft&quot; phase,
and while the general outlines are stable,
details change frequently.
Until the specification is stabilized, the `wgpu` crate and the version of WGSL it implements
will likely differ from what is specified,
as the implementation catches up.

Exactly which WGSL features `wgpu` supports depends on how you are using it:

- When running as native code, `wgpu` uses [Naga][naga]
  to translate WGSL code into the shading language of your platform&#039;s native GPU API.
  Naga is working on catching up to the WGSL specification,
  with [bugs][naga bugs] tracking various issues,
  but there is no concise summary of differences from the specification.

- When running in a web browser (by compilation to WebAssembly)
  without the `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` relies on the browser&#039;s own WebGPU implementation.
  WGSL shaders are simply passed through to the browser,
  so that determines which WGSL features you can use.

- When running in a web browser with `wgpu`&#039;s `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` uses Naga to translate WGSL programs into GLSL.
  This uses the same version of Naga as if you were running `wgpu` as native code.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Step 2. Set up your shell to use Starship

Configure your shell to initialize starship. Select yours from the list below:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Bash&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
eval &quot;$(starship init bash)&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cmd&lt;/summary&gt;

You need to use [Clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html) (v1.2.30+) with Cmd.
Create a file at this path `%LocalAppData%\clink\starship.lua` with the following contents:

```lua
load(io.popen(&#039;starship init cmd&#039;):read(&quot;*a&quot;))()
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Elvish&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/elvish/rc.elv` (`%AppData%\elvish\rc.elv` on Windows):

```sh
eval (starship init elvish)
```

Note: Only Elvish v0.18+ is supported. For elvish versions prior to v0.21.0 the config file might instead be `~/.elvish/rc.elv`

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Fish&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
starship init fish | source
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Ion&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/ion/initrc`:

```sh
eval $(starship init ion)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Nushell&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of your Nushell configuration (find it by running `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):

```sh
mkdir ($nu.data-dir | path join &quot;vendor/autoload&quot;)
starship init nu | save -f ($nu.data-dir | path join &quot;vendor/autoload/starship.nu&quot;)
```

Note: Only Nushell v0.96+ is supported

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;PowerShell&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of your PowerShell configuration (find it by running `$PROFILE`):

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&amp;starship init powershell)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Tcsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.tcshrc`:

```sh
eval `starship init tcsh`
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Xonsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.xonshrc`:

```python
execx($(starship init xonsh))
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Zsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
eval &quot;$(starship init zsh)&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Step 3. Configure Starship

Start a new shell instance, and you should see your beautiful new shell prompt.

This repository has the source code for Comprehensive Rust 🦀, a multi-day Rust
course developed by the Android team. The course covers all aspects of Rust,
from basic syntax to generics and error handling. It also includes deep dives on
[Android], [Chromium], [bare-metal], and [concurrency].

[Android]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/android.html
[Chromium]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/chromium.html
[bare-metal]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html
[concurrency]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html

Read the course at **https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/**.

## Course Format and Target Audience

The course is used internally at Google to teach Rust to experienced software
engineers, typically with a background in C++ or Java.

The course is taught in a classroom setting, and we hope it will be useful for
others who want to teach Rust to their team. The course is less ideal for
self-study, since you would miss out on classroom discussions. You would not see
the questions and answers, nor the compiler errors we trigger when going through
the code samples. We hope to improve the self-study experience via
[speaker notes](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/53) and by
[publishing videos](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/52).

| `cargo xtask web-tests`     | Run the web driver tests in the tests directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `cargo xtask build`         | Create a static version of the course in the `book/` directory. Note that you have to separately build and zip exercises and add them to book/html. To build any of the translated versions of the course, add the language flag (--language or -l) followed by xx, where xx is the ISO 639 language code (e.g. cargo xtask build -l da for the Danish translation). [TRANSLATIONS.md](TRANSLATIONS.md) contains further instructions. |

## Staying ahead

Star RustFS on GitHub and be instantly notified of new releases.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee40bb4-3e46-4eac-b0d0-5fbeb85ff8f3&quot; /&gt;

## Quickstart

To get started with RustFS, follow these steps:

### 1. One-click Installation (Option 1)

```bash
curl -O https://rustfs.com/install_rustfs.sh &amp;&amp; bash install_rustfs.sh
```

### 2\. Docker Quick Start (Option 2)

The RustFS container runs as a non-root user `rustfs` (UID `10001`). If you run Docker with `-v` to mount a host directory, please ensure the host directory owner is set to `10001`, otherwise you will encounter permission denied errors.

```bash
 # Create data and logs directories
 mkdir -p data logs

 # Change the owner of these directories
 chown -R 10001:10001 data logs

 # Using latest version
 docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:latest

 # Using specific version
 docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:1.0.0-alpha.76
```

If you use [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) instead of docker, you can install the RustFS with the below command

```bash
 podman run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:latest
```

You can also use Docker Compose. Using the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory:

```bash
docker compose --profile observability up -d
```

Similarly, you can run the command with podman

```bash
podman compose --profile observability up -d
```

**NOTE**: We recommend reviewing the `docker-compose.yaml` file before running. It defines several services including Grafana, Prometheus, and Jaeger, which are helpful for RustFS observability. If you wish to start Redis or Nginx containers, you can specify the corresponding profiles.

### 3\. Build from Source (Option 3) - Advanced Users

For developers who want to build RustFS Docker images from source with multi-architecture support:

```bash
# Build multi-architecture images locally
./docker-buildx.sh --build-arg RELEASE=latest

# Build and push to registry
./docker-buildx.sh --push

# Build specific version
./docker-buildx.sh --release v1.0.0 --push

# Build for custom registry
./docker-buildx.sh --registry your-registry.com --namespace yourname --push
```

The `docker-buildx.sh` script supports:

- **Multi-architecture builds**: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
- **Automatic version detection**: Uses git tags or commit hashes
- **Registry flexibility**: Supports Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.
- **Build optimization**: Includes caching and parallel builds

You can also use Make targets for convenience:

```bash
make docker-buildx                    # Build locally
make docker-buildx-push               # Build and push
make docker-buildx-version VERSION=v1.0.0  # Build specific version
make help-docker                      # Show all Docker-related commands
```

&gt; **Heads-up (macOS cross-compilation)**: macOS keeps the default `ulimit -n` at 256, so `cargo zigbuild` or `./build-rustfs.sh --platform ...` may fail with `ProcessFdQuotaExceeded` when targeting Linux. The build script attempts to raise the limit automatically, but if you still see the warning, run `ulimit -n 4096` (or higher) in your shell before building.

### 4\. Build with Helm Chart (Option 4) - Cloud Native

Follow the instructions in the [Helm Chart README](https://charts.rustfs.com/) to install RustFS on a Kubernetes cluster.

### 5\. Nix Flake (Option 5)

If you have [Nix with flakes enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes):

```bash
# Run directly without installing
nix run github:rustfs/rustfs

# Build the binary
