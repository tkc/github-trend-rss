## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust&#039;s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on
correctly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
&gt; the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
&gt; We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

Install optional dependencies as &#039;extras&#039; for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):

```bash
pip install -U &quot;nautilus_trader[docker,ib]&quot;
```

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |

**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.
Skipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, in

A hat-based orchestration framework that keeps Ralph in a loop until the task is done.

&gt; &quot;Me fail English? That&#039;s unpossible!&quot; - Ralph Wiggum

**Alpha Notice:** Ralph Orchestrator is under active development. It works today, but expect rough edges and breaking changes between releases.

v1.0.0 was ralphed into existence with little oversight and guidance. v2.0.0 is a simpler, more-structured implementation. Looking for the old version? See [v1.2.3](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator/tree/v1.2.3).

## What is Ralph?

Ralph implements the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) — autonomous task completion through continuous iteration.

&gt; &quot;The orchestrator is a thin coordination layer, not a platform. Ralph is smart; let Ralph do the work.&quot;

### Two Modes of Operation

Ralph supports two orchestration styles:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Traditional** | Simple loop — Ralph iterates until done | Quick tasks, simple automation, minimal config |
| **Hat-Based** | Ralph can wear many hats — specialized personas coordinate through events | Complex workflows, multi-step processes, role separation |

**Traditional mode** is the original Ralph Wiggum approach: start a loop, let it run until it outputs the completion promise. No roles, no events, just iteration.

**Hat-based mode** adds structure: specialized personas coordinate through events. You define the roles that fit your workflow — reviewers, testers, documenters, whatever makes sense. Presets provide ready-made patterns like TDD or spec-driven development.

### The Ralph Tenets

1. **Fresh Context Is Reliability** — Each iteration clears context. Re-read specs, plan, code every cycle.
2. **Backpressure Over Prescription** — Don&#039;t prescribe how; create gates that reject bad work.
3. **The Plan Is Disposable** — Regeneration costs one planning loop. Cheap.
4. **Disk Is State, Git Is Memory** — Files are the handoff mechanism.
5. **Steer With Signals, Not Scripts** — Add signs, not scripts.
6. **Let Ralph Ralph** — Sit *on* the loop, not *in* it.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full philosophy.

## Features

- **Multi-Backend Support** — Works with Claude Code, Kiro, Gemini CLI, Codex, Amp, Copilot CLI, and OpenCode
- **Hat System** — Specialized Ralph personas with distinct behaviors
- **Event-Driven Coordination** — Hats communicate through typed events with glob pattern matching
- **Backpressure Enforcement** — Gates that reject incomplete work (tests, lint, typecheck)
- **Presets Library** — 20+ pre-configured workflows for common development patterns
- **Interactive TUI** — Real-time terminal UI for monitoring Ralph&#039;s activity (experimental)
- **Session Recording** — Record and replay sessions for debugging and testing (experimental)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75+
- At least one AI CLI:
  - [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (recommended)
  - [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
  - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
  - [Amp](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp)
  - [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot) (`npm install -g @github/copilot`)
  - [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`)

### Via npm (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @ralph-orchestrator/ralph-cli

# Or run directly with npx
npx @ralph-orchestrator/ralph-cli --version
```

### Via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install ralph-orchestrator
```

### Via Cargo

```bash
cargo install ralph-cli
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator.git
cd ralph-orchestrator
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release&quot;

# Or create symlink
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/target/release/ralph /usr/local/bin/ralph
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
ralph --version
ralph --help
```

### Migrating from v1 (Python)

If you have the old Python-based Ralph v1 installed, uninstall it first to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# If installed via pip
pip uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# If installed via pipx
pipx uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# If installed via uv
uv tool uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# Verify removal
which ralph  # Should return nothing or point to new Rust version
```

The v1 Python version is no longer maintained. See [v1.2.3](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator/tree/v1.2.3) for historical reference.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Project

```bash
# Traditional mode — simple loop, no hats (recommended for getting started)
ralph init --backend claude

# Hat-based mode — use a preset workflow with specialized personas
ralph init --preset tdd-red-green

# Combine preset with different backend
ralph init --preset spec-driven --backend kiro

# See all available presets
ralph init --list-presets
```

This creates `ralph.yml` in your current directory. Without a preset, you get traditional mode (no hats). With a preset, you get hat-based orchestration.

### 2. Define Your Task

**Option A:** Create a `PROMPT.md` file:

```bash
cat &gt; PROMPT.md &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
Build a REST API with the following endpoints:
- POST /users - Create a new user
- GET /users/:id - Get user by ID
- PUT /users/:id - Update user
- DELETE /users/:id - Delete user

Use Express.js with TypeScript. Include input validation
and proper error handling.
EOF
```

**Option B:** Pass inline prompt when running:

```bash
ralph run -p &quot;Add input validation to the user API endpoints&quot;
```

### 3. Run Ralph

```bash
# Autonomous mode (headless, default)
ralph run

# With inline prompt
ralph run -p &quot;Implement the login endpoint with JWT authentication&quot;

# Interactive TUI mode (experimental)
ralph run -i

# Resume interrupted session
ralph resume

# Dry run (show what would execute)
ralph run --dry-run
```

### Alternative: SOP-Driven Sessions

For standalone planning and task generation (without Ralph&#039;s event loop), use these commands:

```bash
# Start an interactive PDD planning session
ralph plan                           # SOP prompts for input
ralph plan &quot;build a REST API&quot;        # Provide idea inline
ralph plan --backend kiro &quot;my idea&quot;  # Use specific backend

# Generate code task files from descriptions
ralph task                           # SOP prompts for input
ralph task &quot;add authentication&quot;      # From description
ralph task specs/feature/plan.md     # From PDD plan file
```

These commands spawn an interactive AI session with bundled SOPs — perfect for one-off planning without configuring a full workflow.

## Configuration

Ralph uses a YAML configuration file (`ralph.yml` by default).

### Traditional Mode (No Hats)

The simplest configuration — just a loop that runs until completion:

```yaml
# ralph.yml — Traditional mode
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;

event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;
  max_iterations: 100
```

This runs Ralph in a loop. No hats, no events, no role switching. Ralph iterates until it outputs `LOOP_COMPLETE` or hits the iteration limit.

### Hat-Based Mode (Specialized Personas)

&gt; Ralph can wear many hats.

Add a `hats` section to enable role-based orchestration. Hats subscribe to events (triggers) and publish events when done:

```yaml
# ralph.yml — Hat-based mode (example structure)
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;

event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;
  max_iterations: 100
  starting_event: &quot;task.start&quot;

hats:
  my_hat:
    name: &quot;🎯 My Hat&quot;
    triggers: [&quot;task.start&quot;]        # Events that activate this hat
    publishes: [&quot;work.done&quot;]        # Events this hat can emit
    instructions: |
      Your instructions here...
```

With hats, Ralph publishes a starting event, which triggers the matching hat. That hat does its work and publishes an event, potentially triggering other hats. This event-driven handoff continues until completion.

&gt; **Tip:** Use `ralph init --preset &lt;name&gt;` to get pre-configured hat workflows. See [Presets](#presets) for ready-made patterns like TDD, spec-driven development, and more.

### Full Configuration Reference

```yaml
# Event loop settings
event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;  # Output that signals completion
  max_iterations: 100                   # Maximum orchestration loops
  max_runtime_seconds: 14400            # 4 hours max runtime
  idle_timeout_secs: 1800               # 30 min idle timeout
  starting_event: &quot;task.start&quot;          # First event published

# CLI backend settings
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;                     # claude, kiro, gemini, codex, amp, copilot, opencode, custom
  prompt_mode: &quot;arg&quot;                    # arg (CLI argument) or stdin
  experimental_tui: false               # Enable TUI mode support

# Core behaviors (always injected into prompts)
core:
  scratchpad: &quot;.agent/scratchpad.md&quot;    # Shared memory across iterations
  specs_dir: &quot;./specs/&quot;                 # Directory for specifications
  guardrails:                           # Rules injected into every prompt
    - &quot;Fresh context each iteration - scratchpad is memory&quot;
    - &quot;Don&#039;t assume &#039;not implemented&#039; - search first&quot;
    - &quot;Backpressure is law - tests/typecheck/lint must pass&quot;

# Custom hats (omit to use default planner/builder)
hats:
  my_hat:
    name: &quot;My Hat Name&quot;                 # Display name
    triggers: [&quot;some.event&quot;]            # Events that activate this hat
    publishes: [&quot;other.event&quot;]          # Events this hat can emit
    instructions: |                     # Prompt instructions
      What this hat should do...
```

```

## Key Concepts

### Hats

Hats are specialized Ralph personas. Each hat has:

- **Triggers**: Events that activate this hat
- **Publishes**: Events this hat can emit
- **Instructions**: Prompt injected when hat is active

View event history:

```bash
ralph events
```

### Scratchpad

All hats share `.agent/scratchpad.md` — persistent memory across iterations. This enables hats to build on previous work rather than starting fresh.

The scratchpad is the primary mechanism for:
- Task tracking (with `[ ]`, `[x]`, `[~]` markers)
- Context preservation between iterations
- Handoff between hats

### Backpressure

Ralph enforces quality gates through backpressure. When a builder publishes `build.done`, it must include evidence:

```
tests: pass, lint: pass, typecheck: pass
```

## Building &amp; Testing

### Build

```bash
cargo build           # Debug build
cargo build --release # Release build
```

### Test

```bash
# Run all tests (includes smoke tests with JSONL replay)
cargo test

# Run smoke tests specifically
cargo test -p ralph-core smoke_runner

# Run Kiro-specific smoke tests
cargo test -p ralph-core kiro
```

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests use recorded JSONL fixtures instead of live API calls — fast, free, and deterministic.

**Fixture locations:**
- `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/basic_session.jsonl` — Claude CLI session
- `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/kiro/` — Kiro CLI sessions

**Recording new fixtures:**

```bash
# Record a session
ralph run -c ralph.yml --record-session session.jsonl -p &quot;your prompt&quot;

# Or capture raw CLI output
claude -p &quot;your prompt&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee output.txt
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
cargo fmt --check
```

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/23431#issuecomment-1302557034), lead developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) (also [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028)):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

### Installation

Ruff is available as [`ruff`](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) on PyPI.

Invoke Ruff directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```shell
uvx ruff check   # Lint all files in the current directory.
uvx ruff format  # Format all files in the current directory.
```

Or install Ruff with `uv` (recommended), `pip`, or `pipx`:

```shell
# With uv.
uv tool install ruff@latest  # Install Ruff globally.
uv add --dev ruff            # Or add Ruff to your project.

# With pip.
pip install ruff

```

You can also install Ruff via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruff), [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ruff),
and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.14.13
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

## Chroma Cloud

Our hosted service, Chroma Cloud, powers serverless vector and full-text search. It&#039;s extremely fast, cost-effective, scalable and painless. Create a DB and try it out in under 30 seconds with $5 of free credits.

[Get started with Chroma Cloud](https://trychroma.com/signup)

## API

The core API is only 4 functions (run our [💡 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing)):

```python
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection(&quot;all-my-documents&quot;)

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=[&quot;This is document1&quot;, &quot;This is document2&quot;], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;notion&quot;}, {&quot;source&quot;: &quot;google-docs&quot;}], # filter on these!
    ids=[&quot;doc1&quot;, &quot;doc2&quot;], # unique for each doc
)

# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=[&quot;This is a query document&quot;],
    n_results=2,
    # where={&quot;metadata_field&quot;: &quot;is_equal_to_this&quot;}, # optional filter
    # where_document={&quot;$contains&quot;:&quot;search_string&quot;}  # optional filter
)
```

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.html#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Tabs.html)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Layout.html#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html) page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out [awesome-niri], a list of niri-related links and projects.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: [integrated](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite) via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.

## Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

## Status

This project has reached a minimum-viable-product level of quality. Many people use it as their daily driver, but it may be unstable for some commands. Nu&#039;s design is subject to change as it matures.

## Learning About Nu

The [Nushell book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/) is the primary source of Nushell documentation. You can find [a full list of Nu commands in the book](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/), and we have many examples of using Nu in our [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/).

We&#039;re also active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn); come and chat with us!

## Installation

To quickly install Nu:

```bash
# Linux and macOS
brew install nushell
# Windows
winget install nushell
```

To use `Nu` in GitHub Action, check [setup-nu](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nu) for more detail.

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [installation chapter of the book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html). Nu is available via many package managers:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nushell.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions)

For details about which platforms the Nushell team actively supports, see [our platform support policy](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

## Configuration

The default configurations can be found at [sample_config](crates/nu-utils/src/default_files)
which are the configuration files one gets when they startup Nushell for the first time.

It sets all of the default configuration to run Nushell.  From here one can
then customize this file for their specific needs.

To see where *config.nu* is located on your system simply type this command.

```rust
$nu.config-path
```

Please see our [book](https://www.nushell.sh) for all of the Nushell documentation.


## Philosophy

Nu draws inspiration from projects like PowerShell, functional programming languages, and modern CLI tools.
Rather than thinking of files and data as raw streams of text, Nu looks at each input as something with structure.
For example, when you list the contents of a directory what you get back is a table of rows, where each row represents an item in that directory.
These values can be piped through a series of steps, in a series of commands called a &#039;pipeline&#039;.

### Pipelines

In Unix, it&#039;s common to pipe between commands to split up a sophisticated command over multiple steps.
Nu takes this a step further and builds heavily on the idea of _pipelines_.
As in the Unix philosophy, Nu allows commands to output to stdout and read from stdin.
Additionally, commands can output structured data (you can think of this as a third kind of stream).
Commands that work in the pipeline fit into one of three categories:

-   Commands that produce a stream (e.g., `ls`)
-   Commands that filter a stream (e.g., `where type == &quot;dir&quot;`)
-   Commands that consume the output of the pipeline (e.g., `table`)

Commands are separated by the pipe symbol (`|`) to denote a pipeline flowing left to right.

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot; | table
# =&gt; ╭────┬──────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────╮
# =&gt; │ #  │   name   │ type │  size   │   modified    │
# =&gt; ├────┼──────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┤
# =&gt; │  0 │ .cargo   │ dir  │     0 B │ 9 minutes ago │
# =&gt; │  1 │ assets   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  2 │ crates   │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  3 │ docker   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  4 │ docs     │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  5 │ images   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  6 │ pkg_mgrs │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  7 │ samples  │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  8 │ src      │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │  9 │ target   │ dir  │     0 B │ a day ago     │
# =&gt; │ 10 │ tests    │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; │ 11 │ wix      │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │
# =&gt; ╰────┴──────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────╯
```

Because most of the time you&#039;ll want to see the output of a pipeline, `table` is assumed.
We could have also written the above:

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot;
```

Being able to use the same commands and compose them differently is an important philosophy in Nu.
For example, we could use the built-in `ps` command to get a list of the running processes, using the same `where` as above.

```shell
ps | where cpu &gt; 0
# =&gt; ╭───┬───────┬───────────┬───────┬───────────┬───────────╮
# =&gt; │ # │  pid  │   name    │  cpu  │    mem    │  virtual  │
# =&gt; ├───┼───────┼───────────┼───────┼───────────┼───────────┤
# =&gt; │ 0 │  2240 │ Slack.exe │ 16.40 │ 178.3 MiB │ 232.6 MiB │
# =&gt; │ 1 │ 16948 │ Slack.exe │ 16.32 │ 205.0 MiB │ 197.9 MiB │
# =&gt; │ 2 │ 17700 │ nu.exe    │  3.77 │  26.1 MiB │   8.8 MiB │
# =&gt; ╰───┴───────┴───────────┴───────┴───────────┴───────────╯
```

### Opening files

Nu can load file and URL contents as raw text or structured data (if it recognizes the format).
For example, you can load a .toml file as structured data and explore it:

```shell
open Cargo.toml
# =&gt; ╭──────────────────┬────────────────────╮
# =&gt; │ bin              │ [table 1 row]      │
# =&gt; │ dependencies     │ {record 25 fields} │
# =&gt; │ dev-dependencies │ {record 8 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ features         │ {record 10 fields} │
# =&gt; │ package          │ {record 13 fields} │
# =&gt; │ patch            │ {record 1 field}   │
# =&gt; │ profile          │ {record 3 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ target           │ {record 3 fields}  │
# =&gt; │ workspace        │ {record 1 field}   │
# =&gt; ╰──────────────────┴────────────────────╯
```

We can pipe this into a command that gets the contents of one of the columns:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package
# =&gt; ╭───────────────┬────────────────────────────────────╮
# =&gt; │ authors       │ [list 1 item]                      │
# =&gt; │ default-run   │ nu                                 │
# =&gt; │ description   │ A new type of shell                │
# =&gt; │ documentation │ https://www.nushell.sh/book/       │
# =&gt; │ edition       │ 2018                               │
# =&gt; │ exclude       │ [list 1 item]                      │
# =&gt; │ homepage      │ https://www.nushell.sh             │
# =&gt; │ license       │ MIT                                │
# =&gt; │ metadata      │ {record 1 field}                   │
# =&gt; │ name          │ nu                                 │
# =&gt; │ repository    │ https://github.com/nushell/nushell │
# =&gt; │ rust-version  │ 1.60                               │
# =&gt; │ version       │ 0.72.0                             │
# =&gt; ╰───────────────┴────────────────────────────────────╯
```

And if needed we can drill down further:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package.version
# =&gt; 0.72.0
```

### Plugins

Nu supports plugins that offer additional functionality to the shell and follow the same structured data model that built-in commands use. There are a few examples in the `crates/nu_plugins_*` directories.

Plugins are binaries that are available in your path and follow a `nu_plugin_*` naming convention.
These binaries interact with nu via a simple JSON-RPC protocol where the command identifies itself and passes along its configuration, making it available for use.
If the plugin is a filter, data streams to it one element at a time, and it can stream data back in return via stdin/stdout.
If the plugin is a sink, it is given the full vector of final data and is given free reign over stdin/stdout to use as it pleases.

The [awesome-nu repo](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu#plugins) lists a variety of nu-plugins while the [showcase repo](https://github.com/nushell/showcase) *shows* off informative blog posts that have been written about Nushell along with videos that highlight technical
topics that have been presented.

## Goals

Nu adheres closely to a set of goals that make up its design philosophy. As features are added, they are checked against these goals.

-   First and foremost, Nu is cross-platform. Commands and techniques should work across platforms and Nu has [first-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

-   Nu ensures compatibility with existing platform-specific executables.

-   Nu&#039;s workflow and tools should have the usability expected of modern software in 2022 (and beyond).

-   Nu views data as either structured or unstructured. It is a structured shell like PowerShell.

-   Finally, Nu views data functionally. Rather than using mutation, pipelines act as a means to load, change, and save data without mutable state.

**Spice** is a SQL query, search, and LLM-inference engine, written in Rust, for data apps and agents.

&lt;img width=&quot;740&quot; alt=&quot;Spice.ai Open Source accelerated data query and LLM-inference engine&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9db94f9c-10a1-47b0-ab45-05aa964590ff&quot; /&gt;

Spice provides four industry standard APIs in a lightweight, portable runtime (single binary/container):

1. **SQL Query &amp; Search**: HTTP, Arrow Flight, Arrow Flight SQL, ODBC, JDBC, and ADBC APIs; `vector_search` and `text_search` UDTFs.
2. **OpenAI-Compatible APIs**: HTTP APIs for OpenAI SDK compatibility, local model serving (CUDA/Metal accelerated), and hosted model gateway.
3. **Iceberg Catalog REST APIs**: A unified Iceberg REST Catalog API.
4. **MCP HTTP+SSE APIs**: Integration with external tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP) using HTTP and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

🎯 Goal: Developers can focus on building data apps and AI agents confidently, knowing they are grounded in data.

Spice&#039;s primary features include:

- **Data Federation**: SQL query across any database, data warehouse, or data lake. Scale from single-node to distributed multi-node query execution. [Learn More](https://spiceai.org/docs/features/query-federation).
- **Data Materialization and Acceleration**: Materialize, accelerate, and cache database queries with Arrow, DuckDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, or Spice Cayenne (Vortex). [Read the MaterializedView interview - Building a CDN for Databases](https://materializedview.io/p/building-a-cdn-for-databases-spice-ai)
- **Enterprise Search**: Keyword, vector, and full-text search with Tantivy-powered BM25 and petabyte-scale vector similarity search via Amazon S3 Vectors or pgvector for structured and unstructured data.
- **AI apps and agents**: An AI-database powering retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and intelligent agents with OpenAI-compatible APIs and MCP integration. [Learn More](https://spiceai.org/docs/use-cases/rag).

If you want to build with DataFusion, DuckDB, or Vortex, Spice provides a simple, flexible, and production-ready engine you can just use.

📣 Read the [Spice.ai 1.0-stable announcement](https://spiceai.org/blog/announcing-1.0-stable).

Spice is built-on industry leading technologies including [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org), Apache Arrow, Arrow Flight, SQLite, and DuckDB.

## Why Spice?

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/96b5fcef-a550-4ce8-a74a-83931275e83e&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;Spice.ai&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/29e4421d-8942-4f2a-8397-e9d4fdeda36b&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Spice simplifies building data-driven AI applications and agents by making it fast and easy to query, federate, and accelerate data from one or more sources using SQL, while grounding AI in real-time, reliable data. Co-locate datasets with apps and AI models to power AI feedback loops, enable RAG and search, and deliver fast, low-latency data-query and AI-inference with full control over cost and performance.

### Latest Capabilities

- **Spice Cayenne Data Accelerator (Beta)**: Simplified multi-file acceleration using the [Vortex columnar format](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex) + SQLite metadata. Delivers DuckDB-comparable performance without single-file scaling limitations.
- **Multi-Node Distributed Query (Preview)**: Scale query execution across multiple nodes with Apache Ballista integration for improved performance on large datasets.
- **Acceleration Snapshots**: Bootstrap accelerations from S3 for fast cold starts (seconds vs. minutes). Supports ephemeral storage with persistent recovery.
- **Iceberg Table Writes**: Write to Iceberg tables using standard SQL `INSERT INTO` for data ingestion and transformation—no Spark required.
- **Petabyte-Scale Vector Search**: Native Amazon S3 Vectors integration manages the full vector lifecycle from ingestion to embedding to querying. SQL-integrated hybrid search with RRF.

### How is Spice different?

1. **AI-Native Runtime**: Spice combines data query and AI inference in a single engine, for data-grounded AI and accurate AI.

2. **Application-Focused**: Designed to run distributed at the application and agent level, often as a 1:1 or 1:N mapping between app and Spice instance, unlike traditional data systems built for many apps on one centralized database. It’s common to spin up multiple Spice instances—even one per tenant or customer.

3. **Dual-Engine Acceleration**: Supports both **OLAP** (Arrow/DuckDB) and **OLTP** (SQLite/PostgreSQL) engines at the dataset level, providing flexible performance across analytical and transactional workloads.

4. **Disaggregated Storage**: Separation of compute from disaggregated storage, co-locating local, materialized working sets of data with applications, dashboards, or ML pipelines while accessing source data in its original storage.

5. **Edge to Cloud Native**: Deploy as a standalone instance, Kubernetes sidecar, microservice, or cluster—across edge/POP, on-prem, and public clouds. Chain multiple Spice instances for tier-optimized, distributed deployments.

## FAQ

- **Is Spice a cache?** No specifically; you can think of Spice data acceleration as an _active_ cache, materialization, or data prefetcher. A cache would fetch data on a cache-miss while Spice prefetches and materializes filtered data on an interval, trigger, or as data changes using CDC. In addition to acceleration Spice supports [results caching](https://spiceai.org/docs/features/caching).

- **Is Spice a CDN for databases?** Yes, a common use-case for Spice is as a CDN for different data sources. Using CDN concepts, Spice enables you to ship (load) a working set of your database (or data lake, or data warehouse) where it&#039;s most frequently accessed, like from a data-intensive application or for AI context.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/whatissurreal.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is SurrealDB?&lt;/h2&gt;

SurrealDB is a multi-model database built in Rust designed to unify multiple data models into a single engine. SurrealDB combines document, graph, relational, time-series, geospatial and key-value data types with powerful search and retrieval functionalities (full-text, vector, hybrid) and real-time and event-driven capabilities, enabling developers to build powerful applications faster and more efficiently. SurrealDB can also be used as a backend-as-a-service given its support for end user authentication. Given that it’s a single Rust binary, SurrealDB can run embedded (in‐app), in the browser (via WebAssembly), in the edge, self-hosted as single backend node, or in a distributed cluster in the cloud.

SurrealDB is used for data-intensive systems such as applications requiring multiple data types, data layer for AI agents, knowledge graphs, real-time apps (e.g. recommendation engines, fraud detection systems) and embedded/edge systems. With SurrealDB, you can simplify your database and API infrastructure, reduce development time, and build secure, performant apps quickly and cost-effectively.

**Key features of SurrealDB include:**

- **Reduces development time**: SurrealDB simplifies your database and API stack by removing the need for most server-side components, allowing you to build secure, performant apps faster and cheaper.
- **Real-time collaborative API backend service:** SurrealDB functions as both a database and an API backend service, enabling real-time collaboration.
- **Support for multiple querying languages:** SurrealDB supports SQL querying from client devices, GraphQL, ACID transactions, WebSocket connections, structured and unstructured data, graph querying, full-text and vector indexing, and geospatial querying.
- **Granular access control**: SurrealDB provides row-level permissions-based access control, giving you the ability to manage data access with precision.

&lt;/a&gt;

SurrealDB is available as a [managed cloud service](https://app.surrealdb.com/overview). Forget about infrastructure operations, monitoring, backups or capacity planning. [SurrealDB Cloud](https://surrealdb.com/cloud) allows you to focus on building great products using the power and flexibility of SurrealDB in just a few clicks. Grow from prototype to enterprise-scale. The SurrealDB Cloud scalable architecture allows your database to evolve as your application grows, ensuring you are always ahead of demand. However if you want to deploy SurrealDB yourself, keep reading below.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/installation.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

SurrealDB is designed to be simple to install and simple to run - using just one command from your terminal. In addition to traditional installation, SurrealDB can be installed and run with HomeBrew, Docker, or using any other container orchestration tool such as Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Rancher, or in Kubernetes.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/apple.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on macOS&lt;/h4&gt;

The quickest way to get going with SurrealDB on macOS is to use Homebrew. This will install both the command-line tools, and the SurrealDB server as a single executable. If you don&#039;t use Homebrew, follow the instructions for Linux below to install SurrealDB.

```bash
brew install surrealdb/tap/surreal
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```bash
brew install surrealdb/tap/surreal-nightly
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/linux.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on Linux&lt;/h4&gt;

The easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB on Unix operating systems is to install and use the SurrealDB command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh
```

If you want to run a beta release, before the next version is released, the `beta` version:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh -s -- --beta
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh -s -- --nightly
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/windows.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on Windows&lt;/h4&gt;

The easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB on Windows is to install and use the SurrealDB command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.surrealdb.com -useb | iex
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```ps1
iex &quot;&amp; { $(irm https://windows.surrealdb.com) } -Nightly&quot;
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/docker.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Run using Docker&lt;/h4&gt;

Docker can be used to manage and run SurrealDB database instances without the need to install any command-line tools. The SurrealDB docker container contains the full command-line tools for importing and exporting data from a running server, or for running a server itself.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start
```

For just getting started with a development server running in memory, you can pass the container a basic initialization to set the user and password as root and enable logging.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --log info --user root --pass root memory
``` 

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/features.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Quick look&lt;/h2&gt;

With strongly-typed data types, data can be fully modelled right in the database.

```sql
UPDATE person SET
    waist = &lt;int&gt; &quot;34&quot;,
    height = &lt;float&gt; 201,
    score = &lt;decimal&gt; 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1
;
```

Store dynamically computed fields which are calculated when retrieved.

```sql
DEFINE FIELD can_drive ON TABLE person COMPUTED time::now() &gt; birthday + 18y;
CREATE person SET birthday = d&quot;2007-06-22&quot;;
;
```

Easily work with unstructured or structured data, in schema-less or schema-full mode.

```sql
-- Create a schemafull table
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Specify fields on the user table
DEFINE FIELD name ON TABLE user TYPE object;
DEFINE FIELD name.first ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD name.last ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string ASSERT string::is_email($value);

-- Add a unique index on the email field preventing duplicate values
DEFINE INDEX email ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;

-- Create a new event whenever a user changes their email address
DEFINE EVENT email ON TABLE user WHEN $before.email != $after.email THEN (
    CREATE event SET user = $value, time = time::now(), value = $after.email, action = &#039;email_changed&#039;
);
```

Connect records together with fully directed graph edge connections.

```sql
-- Add a graph edge between user:tobie and article:surreal
RELATE user:tobie-&gt;write-&gt;article:surreal
    SET time.written = time::now()
;

-- Add a graph edge between specific users and developers
LET $from = (SELECT users FROM company:surrealdb);
LET $devs = (SELECT * FROM user WHERE tags CONTAINS &#039;developer&#039;);
RELATE $from-&gt;like-&gt;$devs UNIQUE
    SET time.connected = time::now()
;
```

Query data flexibly with advanced expressions and graph queries.

```sql
-- Select a nested array, and filter based on an attribute
SELECT emails[WHERE active = true] FROM person;

-- Select all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level people who this specific person record knows, or likes, as separate outputs
SELECT -&gt;knows-&gt;(? AS f1)-&gt;knows-&gt;(? AS f2)-&gt;(knows, likes AS e3 WHERE influencer = true)-&gt;(? AS f3) FROM person:tobie;

-- Select all person records (and their recipients), who have sent more than 5 emails
SELECT *, -&gt;sent-&gt;email-&gt;to-&gt;person FROM person WHERE count(-&gt;sent-&gt;email) &gt; 5;

-- Select other products purchased by people who purchased this laptop
SELECT &lt;-purchased&lt;-person-&gt;purchased-&gt;product FROM product:laptop;

-- Select products purchased by people in the last 3 weeks who have purchased the same products that we purchased
SELECT -&gt;purchased-&gt;product&lt;-purchased&lt;-person-&gt;(purchased WHERE created_at &gt; time::now() - 3w)-&gt;product FROM person:tobie;
```

Store GeoJSON geographical data types, including points, lines and polygons.

```sql
UPDATE city:london SET
    centre = (-0.118092, 51.509865),
    boundary = {
        type: &quot;Polygon&quot;,
        coordinates: [[
            [-0.38314819, 51.37692386], [0.1785278, 51.37692386],
            [0.1785278, 51.61460570], [-0.38314819, 51.61460570],
            [-0.38314819, 51.37692386]
        ]]
    }
;
```

Write custom embedded logic using JavaScript functions.

```sql
CREATE film SET
    ratings = [
        { rating: 6, user: user:bt8e39uh1ouhfm8ko8s0 },
        { rating: 8, user: user:bsilfhu88j04rgs0ga70 },
    ],
    featured = function() {
        return this.ratings.filter(r =&gt; {
            return r.rating &gt;= 7;
        }).map(r =&gt; {
            return { ...r, rating: r.rating * 10 };
        });
    }
;
```

## Prerequisites

See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for software requirements to develop in this repo.

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX
```

Enable logs for user applications:

```bash
export LINERA_APPLICATION_LOGS=true
```

Set the path of the future wallet:

```bash
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[1]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[1]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;
```

More complex examples may be found in our [developer manual](https://linera.dev) as well
as the [example applications](./examples) in this repository.

## Usage

**Check out our [online demo](https://rustpython.github.io/demo/) running on WebAssembly.**

RustPython requires Rust latest stable version (e.g 1.67.1 at February 7th 2023). If you don&#039;t
currently have Rust installed on your system you can do so by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

To check the version of Rust you&#039;re currently running, use `rustc --version`. If you wish to update,
`rustup update stable` will update your Rust installation to the most recent stable release.

To build RustPython locally, first, clone the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
```

RustPython uses symlinks to manage python libraries in `Lib/`. If on windows, running the following helps:
```bash
git config core.symlinks true
```

Then you can change into the RustPython directory and run the demo (Note: `--release` is
needed to prevent stack overflow on Windows):

```bash
$ cd RustPython
$ cargo run --release demo_closures.py
Hello, RustPython!
```

Or use the interactive shell:

```bash
$ cargo run --release
Welcome to rustpython
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4
```

NOTE: For windows users, please set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` environment variable as `Lib` path in project directory.
(e.g. When RustPython directory is `C:\RustPython`, set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` as `C:\RustPython\Lib`)

You can also install and run RustPython with the following:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython rustpython
$ rustpython
Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

### venv

Because RustPython currently doesn&#039;t provide a well-packaged installation, using venv helps to use pip easier.

```sh
$ rustpython -m venv &lt;your_env_name&gt;
$ . &lt;your_env_name&gt;/bin/activate
$ python # now `python` is the alias of the RustPython for the new env
```

### PIP

If you&#039;d like to make https requests, you can enable the `ssl` feature, which
also lets you install the `pip` package manager. Note that on Windows, you may
need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the `ssl-vendor` feature instead,
which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and `make`.
OpenSSL version 3 is expected and tested in CI. Older versions may not work.

Once you&#039;ve installed rustpython with SSL support, you can install pip by
running:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
rustpython --install-pip
```

You can also install RustPython through the `conda` package manager, though
this isn&#039;t officially supported and may be out of date:

```bash
conda install rustpython -c conda-forge
rustpython
```

### SSL provider

For HTTPS requests, `ssl-rustls` feature is enabled by default. You can replace it with `ssl-openssl` feature if your environment requires OpenSSL.
Note that to use OpenSSL on Windows, you may need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the `ssl-vendor` feature instead,
which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and `make`.
OpenSSL version 3 is expected and tested in CI. Older versions may not work.

### WASI

You can compile RustPython to a standalone WebAssembly WASI module so it can run anywhere.

Build

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --no-default-features --features freeze-stdlib,stdlib --release
```

Run by wasmer

```bash
wasmer run --dir `pwd` -- target/wasm32-wasip1/release/rustpython.wasm `pwd`/extra_tests/snippets/stdlib_random.py
```

Run by wapm

```bash
$ wapm install rustpython
$ wapm run rustpython
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4
```

#### Building the WASI file

You can build the WebAssembly WASI file with:

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1 --features=&quot;freeze-stdlib&quot;
```

&gt; Note: we use the `freeze-stdlib` to include the standard library inside the binary. You also have to run once `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`.

### JIT (Just in time) compiler

RustPython has a **very** experimental JIT compiler that compile python functions into native code.

#### Building

By default the JIT compiler isn&#039;t enabled, it&#039;s enabled with the `jit` cargo feature.

```bash
cargo run --features jit
```

This requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and clang to be installed.

#### Using

To compile a function, call `__jit__()` on it.

```python
def foo():
    a = 5
    return 10 + a

foo.__jit__()  # this will compile foo to native code and subsequent calls will execute that native code
assert foo() == 15
```

## Embedding RustPython into your Rust Applications

Interested in exposing Python scripting in an application written in Rust,
perhaps to allow quickly tweaking logic where Rust&#039;s compile times would be inhibitive?
Then `examples/hello_embed.rs` and `examples/mini_repl.rs` may be of some assistance.

## Disclaimer

RustPython is in development, and while the interpreter certainly can be used
in interesting use cases like running Python in WASM and embedding into a Rust
project, do note that RustPython is not totally production-ready.

Contribution is more than welcome! See our contribution section for more
information on this.

## Conference videos

Checkout those talks on conferences:

- [FOSDEM 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJDY9ASuiLc)
- [EuroPython 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmio0JHy_Y)

## Use cases

Although RustPython is a fairly young project, a few people have used it to
make cool projects:

- [GreptimeDB](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb): an open-source, cloud-native, distributed time-series database. Using RustPython for embedded scripting.
- [pyckitup](https://github.com/pickitup247/pyckitup): a game engine written in
  rust.
- [Robot Rumble](https://github.com/robot-rumble/logic/): an arena-based AI competition platform
- [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/): an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust

## Goals

- Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings)
- A clean implementation without compatibility hacks

## Documentation

Currently along with other areas of the project, documentation is still in an
early phase.

You can read the [online documentation](https://docs.rs/rustpython) for the
latest release, or the [user guide](https://rustpython.github.io/docs/).

You can also generate documentation locally by running:

```shell
cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies
cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies
```

Documentation HTML files can then be found in the `target/doc` directory or you can append `--open` to the previous commands to
have the documentation open automatically on your default browser.

For a high level overview of the components, see the [architecture](architecture/architecture.md) document.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide
contributors through PRs or on Discord. Please refer to the
[development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) as well for tips on developments.

With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of
the best ways to get started are below:

Most tasks are listed in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues). Check issues
labeled with [good first issue](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) if you wish to start coding.

To enhance CPython compatibility, try to increase unittest coverage by checking this article: [How to contribute to RustPython by CPython unittest](https://rustpython.github.io/guideline/2020/04/04/how-to-contribute-by-cpython-unittest.html)

Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object
methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute.

You can also simply run `python -I scripts/whats_left.py` to assist in finding any unimplemented
method.

------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

packaging as Debian:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

(N.B. Various snaps for ripgrep on Ubuntu are also available, but none of them
seem to work right and generate a number of very strange bug reports that I
don&#039;t know how to fix and don&#039;t have the time to fix. Therefore, it is no
longer a recommended installation option.)

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.85.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.85.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Govee to MQTT bridge for Home Assistant

This repo provides a `govee` executable whose primary purpose is to act
as a bridge between [Govee](https://govee.com) devices and Home Assistant,
via the [Home Assistant MQTT Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/).

## Features

* Robust LAN-first design. Not all of Govee&#039;s devices support LAN control,
  but for those that do, you&#039;ll have the lowest latency and ability to
  control them even when your primary internet connection is offline.
* Support for per-device modes and scenes.
* Support for the undocumented AWS IoT interface to your devices, provides
  low latency status updates.
* Support for the new [Platform
  API](https://developer.govee.com/reference/get-you-devices) in case the AWS
  IoT or LAN control is unavailable.

|Feature|Requires|Notes|
|-------|--------|-------------|
|DIY Scenes|API Key|Find in the list of Effects for the light in Home Assistant|
|Music Modes|API Key|Find in the list of Effects for the light in Home Assistant|
|Tap-to-Run / One Click Scene|IoT|Find in the overall list of Scenes in Home Assistant, as well as under the `Govee to MQTT` device|
|Live Device Status Updates|LAN and/or IoT|Devices typically report most changes within a couple of seconds.|
|Segment Color|API Key|Find the `Segment 00X` light entities associated with your main light device in Home Assistant|

* `API Key` means that you have [applied for a key from Govee](https://developer.govee.com/reference/apply-you-govee-api-key)
  and have configured it for use in goovee2mqtt
* `IoT` means that you have configured your Govee account email and password for
  use in govee2mqtt, which will then attempt to use the
  *undocumented and likely unsupported* AWS MQTT-based IoT service
* `LAN` means that you have enabled the [Govee LAN API](https://app-h5.govee.com/user-manual/wlan-guide)
  on supported devices and that the LAN API protocol is functional on your network

## Usage

* [Installing the HASS Add-On](docs/ADDON.md) - for HAOS and Supervised HASS users
* [Running it in Docker](docs/DOCKER.md)
* [Configuration](docs/CONFIG.md)

## Have a question?

* [Is my device supported?](docs/SKUS.md)
* [Check out the FAQ](docs/FAQ.md)

Additionally you may purchase an [Enterprise License](https://stalw.art/enterprise) to obtain priority support from Stalwart Labs LLC.

## Roadmap

Stalwart has reached an exciting point in its journey, it’s now **feature complete**. All the core functionality and open standard email and collaboration protocols that we set out to support are in place. In other words, Stalwart already does everything you’d expect from a modern, standards-compliant mail and collaboration platform.

The next major milestone is all about refinement: finalizing the database schema and focusing on performance optimizations to ensure everything runs as efficiently and reliably as possible. Once that’s done, we’ll be ready to roll out version **1.0**.

Of course, development doesn’t stop there. The community has contributed hundreds of great ideas for improvements and new features, everything from subtle usability tweaks to entirely new integrations. You can see the full list of proposals over on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Aenhancement). If there’s something you’d like to see prioritized, just give it a thumbs up as we plan to implement enhancements based on the community’s votes.

## Support

### Official

bottom _officially_ supports the following operating systems and corresponding architectures:

- macOS (`x86_64`, `aarch64`)
- Linux (`x86_64`, `i686`, `aarch64`)
- Windows (`x86_64`, `i686`)

These platforms are tested to work for the most part and issues on these platforms will be fixed if possible.
Furthermore, binaries are built and tested using the most recent version of stable Rust at the time.

For more details on supported platforms and known problems, check out [the documentation](https://bottom.pages.dev/nightly/support/official/).

### Unofficial

bottom may work on a number of platforms that aren&#039;t officially supported. Note that unsupported platforms:

- Might not be tested in CI to build or pass tests (see [here](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) for checked platforms).
- Might not be properly tested by maintainers prior to a stable release.
- May only receive limited support, such as missing features or bugs that may not be fixed.

Note that some unsupported platforms may eventually be officially supported (e.g., FreeBSD).

A non-comprehensive list of some currently unofficially-supported platforms that may compile/work include:

- FreeBSD (`x86_64`)
- Linux (`armv6`, `armv7`, `powerpc64le`, `riscv64gc`, `loongarch64`)
- Android (`arm64`)
- Windows (`arm64`)

For more details on unsupported platforms and known problems, check out [the documentation](https://bottom.pages.dev/nightly/support/unofficial/).

## Installation

### Cargo

Installation via `cargo` can be done by installing the [`bottom`](https://crates.io/crates/bottom) crate:

```bash
# You might need to update the stable version of Rust first.
# Other versions might work, but this is not guaranteed.
rustup update stable

# Install the binary from crates.io.
cargo install bottom --locked

# If you use another channel by default, you can specify
# the what channel to use like so:
cargo +stable install bottom --locked

# --locked may be omitted if you wish to not use the
# locked crate versions in Cargo.lock. However, be
# aware that this may cause problems with dependencies.
cargo install bottom
```

Alternatively, you can use `cargo install` using the repo as the source.

```bash
# You might need to update the stable version of Rust first.
# Other versions might work, but this is not guaranteed.
rustup update stable

# Option 1 - Download an archive from releases and install
curl -LO https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/archive/0.12.3.tar.gz
tar -xzvf 0.12.3.tar.gz
cargo install --path . --locked

# Option 2 - Manually clone the repo and install
git clone https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom
cd bottom
cargo install --path . --locked

# Option 3 - Install using cargo with the repo as the source
cargo install --git https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom --locked

# You can also pass in the target-cpu=native flag to try to
# use better CPU-specific optimizations. For example:
RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C target-cpu=native&quot; cargo install --path . --locked
```
