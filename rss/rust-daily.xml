![Screenshot of the app, showing a front/back flashcard.](screenshot.webp)

A plain text-based spaced repetition system. Features:

- **Plain Text:** all your flashcards are stored as plain text files, so you can
  operate on them with standard tools, write with your editor of choice, and
  track changes in a VCS.
- **Content Addressable:** cards are identified by the hash of their text. This
  means a card&#039;s progress is reset when the card is edited.
- **Low Friction:** you create flashcards by typing into a text file, using a
  lightweight notation to denote flashcard sides and cloze deletions.
- **Simple:** the only card types are front-back and cloze cards. More complex
  workflows (e.g.: Anki-style note types, card templates, automation) be can
  implemented using a Makefile and some scripts.
- **Efficient:** uses [FSRS] for scheduling reviews, maximizing learning while
  minimizing time spent reviewing.

Announcement blog post: [Hashcards: A Plain-Text Spaced Repetition System][blog].

## Example

The following Markdown file is a valid hashcards deck:

```
Q: How many neurons are there in the human brain?
A: ~80 billion.

C: An [agonist] is a ligand that binds to a receptor and [activates it].

Q: How many synapses are there in a human brain?
A: ~100 trillion

C: In the nervous system, [chemical] communication happens [between] neurons.
```

For a larger example, see [my personal flashcards repo][fc].

## Building

You need [cargo] installed. You can get it through [rustup]. Then:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eudoxia0/hashcards.git
$ cd hashcards
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To drill flashcards in a directory, run:

```
$ hashcards drill $DIRNAME
```

## Tutorial

Create a directory for your flashcards, and add a Markdown file with some cards:

```bash
$ mkdir cards
$ cd cards
$ cat &gt; Geography.md &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
Q: What is Coulomb&#039;s constant?
A: The proportionality constant of the electric force.

Q: What is an object with zero net charge called?
A: Neutral.
EOF
```

A Markdown file is called a &quot;deck&quot;, and the name of the file, sans extension, is
the name of the deck. This will be shown on top of the flashcard during reviews,
this saves you from having to specify the context in each of the flashcards.

Start drilling:

```bash
$ hashcards drill
```

This opens a web interface at `http://localhost:8000` where you can review your
cards. The interface is simple: you read the question, mentally recall the
answer, and click reveal (or press space). Then you grade yourself on how you
did, with one of four choices:

1. Forgot (shortcut: `1`)
2. Hard (shortcut: `2`)
3. Good (shortcut: `3`)
4. Easy (shortcut: `4`)

Be honest. If you got the answer almost right, press &quot;Forgot&quot;. If you mis-grade
something, you can undo (shortcut: `u`). The session ends when every card has
been graded &quot;Good&quot; or higher. You can end the session prematurely by clicking
&quot;End&quot;, this will save your changes.

To learn how to write good flashcards, read [Effective Spaced Repetition][esr].

## Commands

This section documents the hashcards command line interface.

### `drill`

Start a drilling session.

```bash
$ hashcards drill [DIRECTORY]
```

Note: your progress is not saved until the session ends, either when you run out
of cards, or when you click &quot;End&quot;.

Options:

- `--card-limit=&lt;N&gt;`: Limit the session to at most N cards.
- `--new-card-limit=&lt;N&gt;`: Limit the number of new cards in the session.
- `--port=&lt;PORT&gt;`: Use a specific port (default: 8000).
- `--from-deck=&lt;NAME&gt;`: Only drill cards from a deck with the given name.
- `--open-browser=&lt;true|false&gt;`: Whether or not to open the browser after the
  server starts (default: true).

### `stats`

Print collection statistics to standard output.

```bash
$ hashcards stats [DIRECTORY]
```

Options:

- `--format=&lt;FORMAT&gt;`: Output format (`html` or `json`)

At present, only JSON output is supported.

### `check`

Check the integrity of a collection.

```bash
$ hashcards check [DIRECTORY]
```

### `orphans`

Manage orphan cards (cards that exist in the database, but not in the
collection, i.e., cards that were deleted from the collection).

```bash
$ hashcards orphans list [DIRECTORY]
$ hashcards orphans delete [DIRECTORY]
```

Example:

```
$ hashcards orphans list Cards
04effc035b71692b66a90a622559479516526e7720c41afa22b29562915d58af
059e4e0fd5c3d0ab7ef0cc902cdc402a555ec4152b842fe584109de6c8082ce3
061b8c27e0f437d0c6ae735e829b39cc3bf0ad8218cb16387dcb4271c20b244d
$ hashcards orphans delete Cards
04effc035b71692b66a90a622559479516526e7720c41afa22b29562915d58af
059e4e0fd5c3d0ab7ef0cc902cdc402a555ec4152b842fe584109de6c8082ce3
061b8c27e0f437d0c6ae735e829b39cc3bf0ad8218cb16387dcb4271c20b244d
$ hashcards orphans list Cards
# no output
```

### `export`

Export a collection to a JSON file.

```bash
$ hashcards export [DIRECTORY]
```

Options:

- `--output=&lt;PATH&gt;`: The path to the output. By default, the export is printed
  to stdout.

## Format

This section describes the text format used by hashcards.

### Basic Cards

Question-answer flashcards are written like this:

```
Q: What are the possible values of electric charge?
A: Any integer multiple of the fundamental charge.
```

Both the question and the answer can span multiple lines:

```
Q: List the elements of the Platinum group.
A:

- ruthenium
- rhodium
- palladium
- osmium
- iridium
- platinum
```

### Cloze Cards

Cloze cards start with the `C:` tag, and use square brackets to denote cloze
deletions:

```
C: The [order] of a group is [the cardinality of its underlying set].
```

Again, cloze cards can span multiple lines:

```
C:
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

— [Ecclesiastes] [6]:[9]
```

## Features

This section documents specific hashcards features.

### LaTeX Support

Cards support LaTeX math via KaTeX.

Use `$...$` for inline math:

```
Q: What is the combinatorial meaning of $\binom{n}{k}$?
A: From a set of size $n$, we can choose $\binom{n}{k}$ subsets of size $k$.
```

And `$$...$$` for display math:

```
C: The [amount of substance] of a sample, denoted $n$, is defined as:

$$
n = \frac{N}{N_A}
$$

where $N$ is [the number of elementary entities] and $N_A$ is [Avogadro&#039;s constant].
```

You can define custom LaTeX macros by creating a `macros.tex` file in your
collection root:

```
\C \mathbb{C}
\R \mathbb{R}
```

Macro definitions can refer to arguments: `#1` for the first, `#2` for the
second and so on.

### Images

Ordinary Markdown image syntax works:

```
Q: Identify this painting:

![](art/diagram.png)

A: _The Siren_, by John William Waterhouse.
```

By default, image paths are resolved relative to the deck (the Markdown file)
that contains the flashcard. For example, if you have:

```
cards/
  Art Theory/
    Art.md
    Images/
      TheMermaid.jpg
      Circe.jpg
      Odysseus.jpg
```

Then flashcards in `Art.md` can reference images with paths like
`Images/Circe.jpg`.

By prefixing a path with `@/`, you can point to images relative to the
collection root directory, e.g., a path like `@/Art Theory/Images/Circe.jpg`
will always resolve to the same path, even if the deck is moved around within
the collection.

### Audio

Works like images:

```
Q: How do you pronounce &quot;پرنده&quot; in Persian?
A: ![](audio/parande.mp3)
```

### Deck Names

By default, the filename of a deck is the name of a deck, e.g. a file
`Medicine.md` will be parsed as a deck called `Medicine`. It is possible to
override the name using [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) frontmatter, like so:

```
---
name = &quot;Medicine&quot;
---

C: The mitochondria is the [powerhouse] of the cell.
```

Regardless of the filename, cards in this deck will have `Medicine` as their
deck name. This is particularly useful when you want to organize a large number
of cards into different files, while keeping their deck name the same. For
example, when taking notes from a textbook, you might have something like so:

```
Principles of Neural Science/
  Ch1.md
  Ch2.md
  ...
```

But you don&#039;t want the cards in those Markdown files to have `Ch1`, `Ch2`, etc.
as their deck name. TOML frontmatter allows you to give each chapter deck the same
deck name.

## Database

hashcards stores card performance data and the review history in an SQLite3
database. The file is called `hashcards.db` and is found in the root of the card
directory (i.e., the path you pass to the `drill` command).

The `cards` table has the following schema:

| Column             | Type               | Description                                                                                                                         |

| `review_count`     | `integer not null` | The number of times the card has been reviewed.                                                                                     |

The `sessions` table has the following schema:

| Column       | Type                  | Description                                                  |

## Description

Paru is your standard pacman wrapping AUR helper with lots of features and minimal interaction.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/sEh1ZpZZUgXUsgqKxuDdhpdEE.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/sEh1ZpZZUgXUsgqKxuDdhpdEE)

## Installation

```
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
cd paru
makepkg -si
```

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## General Tips

- **Man pages**: For documentation on paru&#039;s options and config file see `paru(8)` and `paru.conf(5)` respectively.

- **Color**: Paru only enables color if color is enabled in pacman. Enable `color` in your `pacman.conf`.

- **File based review**: To get a more advanced review process enable `FileManager` with your file manager of choice in `paru.conf`.

- **Flip search order**: To get search results to start at the bottom and go upwards, enable `BottomUp` in `paru.conf`.

- **Editing PKGBUILDs**: When editing PKGBUILDs, you can commit your changes to make them permanent. When the package is upgraded, `git` will try to merge your changes with upstream&#039;s.

- **PKGBUILD syntax highlighting**: You can install [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) to enable syntax highlighting during PKGBUILD review.

- **Tracking -git packages**: Paru tracks -git package by monitoring the upstream repository. Paru can only do this for packages that paru itself installed. `paru --gendb` will make paru aware of packages it did not install.

## Examples

`paru &lt;target&gt;` -- Interactively search and install `&lt;target&gt;`.

`paru` -- Alias for `paru -Syu`.

`paru -S &lt;target&gt;` -- Install a specific package.

`paru -Sua` -- Upgrade AUR packages.

`paru -Qua` -- Print available AUR updates.

`paru -G &lt;target&gt;` -- Download the PKGBUILD and related files of `&lt;target&gt;`.

`paru -Gp &lt;target&gt;` -- Print the PKGBUILD of `&lt;target&gt;`.

`paru -Gc &lt;target&gt;` -- Print the AUR comments  of `&lt;target&gt;`.

`paru --gendb` -- Generate the devel database for tracking `*-git` packages. This is only needed when you initially start using paru.

`paru -Bi .` -- Build and install a PKGBUILD in the current directory.

## IRC

Paru now has an IRC. #paru on [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/). Feel free to join for discussion and help with paru.

## Debugging

Paru is not an official tool. If paru can&#039;t build a package, you should first check if makepkg can successfully build the package. If it can&#039;t, then you should report the issue to the maintainer. Otherwise, it is likely an issue with paru and should be reported here.

**Iggy** is a persistent message streaming platform written in Rust, supporting QUIC, WebSocket, TCP (custom binary specification) and HTTP (regular REST API) transport protocols, **capable of processing millions of messages per second at ultra-low latency**.

Iggy provides **exceptionally high throughput and performance** while utilizing minimal computing resources.

This is **not yet another extension** running on top of existing infrastructure, such as Kafka or SQL database.

Iggy is a persistent message streaming log **built from the ground up** using low-level I/O with **thread-per-core shared nothing architecture**, `io_uring` and `compio` for maximum speed and efficiency.

The name is an abbreviation for the Italian Greyhound - small yet extremely fast dogs, the best in their class. See the lovely [Fabio &amp; Cookie](https://www.instagram.com/fabio.and.cookie/) ❤️

---

## Features

- **Highly performant**, persistent append-only log for message streaming
- **Very high throughput** for both writes and reads
- **Low latency and predictable resource usage** thanks to the Rust compiled language (no GC) and `io_uring`.
- **User authentication and authorization** with granular permissions and Personal Access Tokens (PAT)
- Support for multiple streams, topics and partitions
- Support for **multiple transport protocols** (QUIC, WebSocket, TCP, HTTP)
- Fully operational RESTful API which can be optionally enabled
- Available client SDK in multiple languages
- **Thread per core shared nothing design** together with `io_uring` guarantee the best possible performance on modern `Linux` systems.
- **Works directly with binary data**, avoiding enforced schema and serialization/deserialization overhead
- Custom **zero-copy (de)serialization**, which greatly improves the performance and reduces memory usage.
- Configurable server features (e.g. caching, segment size, data flush interval, transport protocols etc.)
- Server-side storage of **consumer offsets**
- Multiple ways of polling the messages:
  - By offset (using the indexes)
  - By timestamp (using the time indexes)
  - First/Last N messages
  - Next N messages for the specific consumer
- Possibility of **auto committing the offset** (e.g. to achieve *at-most-once* delivery)
- **Consumer groups** providing the message ordering and horizontal scaling across the connected clients
- **Message expiry** with auto deletion based on the configurable **retention policy**
- Additional features such as **server side message deduplication**
- **Multi-tenant** support via abstraction of **streams** which group **topics**
- **TLS** support for all transport protocols (TCP, WebSocket, QUIC, HTTPS)
- **[Connectors](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/connectors)** - sinks, sources and data transformations based on the **custom Rust plugins**
- **[Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/ai/mcp)** - provide context to LLM with **MCP server**
- Optional server-side as well as client-side **data encryption** using AES-256-GCM
- Optional metadata support in the form of **message headers**
- Optional **data backups and archiving** to disk or **S3** compatible cloud storage (e.g. AWS S3)
- Support for **OpenTelemetry** logs &amp; traces + Prometheus metrics
- Built-in **CLI** to manage the streaming server installable via `cargo install iggy-cli`
- Built-in **benchmarking app** to test the performance
- **Single binary deployment** (no external dependencies)
- Running as a single node (clustering based on Viewstamped Replication will be implemented in the near future)

## Architecture

This is the high-level architecture of the Iggy message streaming server, where extremely high performance and ultra low and stable tail latencies are the primary goals. The server is designed to handle high throughput and very low latency (sub-millisecond tail latencies), making it suitable for real-time applications. For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/introduction/architecture).

![server](assets/iggy_architecture.png)

---

## Version

The official releases follow the regular semver (`0.5.0`) or have `latest` tag applied (`apache/iggy:latest`).

We do also publish edge/dev/nightly releases (e.g. `0.6.0-edge.1` or `apache/iggy:edge`), for both, SDKs and the Docker images, which are typically compatible with the latest changes, but are not guaranteed to be stable, and as the name states, are not recommended for production use.

---

## Roadmap

- **Clustering** &amp; data replication based on **[VSR](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf)** (on sandbox project using Raft, will be implemented after shared-nothing design is completed)

---

## Supported languages SDK

- [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/iggy)
- [C#](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Iggy/)
- [Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.iggy/iggy)
- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/apache-iggy/)
- [Node.js (TypeScript)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apache-iggy)
- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/iggy/foreign/go)

C++ and Elixir are work in progress.

---

## CLI

The interactive CLI is implemented under the `cli` project, to provide the best developer experience. This is a great addition to the Web UI, especially for all the developers who prefer using the console tools.

Iggy CLI can be installed with `cargo install iggy-cli` and then simply accessed by typing `iggy` in your terminal.

![CLI](assets/cli.png)

## Web UI

There&#039;s a dedicated Web UI for the server, which allows managing the streams, topics, partitions, browsing the messages and so on. This is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive dashboard for administrative purposes of the Iggy server. Check the Web UI in the `/web` directory. The [docker image for Web UI](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iggy-web-ui) is available, and can be fetched via `docker pull apache/iggy-web-ui`.

![Web UI](assets/web_ui.png)

---

## Connectors

The highly performant and modular **[runtime](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/connectors)** for statically typed, yet dynamically loaded connectors. Ingest the data from the external sources and push it further to the Iggy streams, or fetch the data from the Iggy streams and push it further to the external sources. **Create your own Rust plugins** by simply implementing either the `Source` or `Sink` trait and **build custom pipelines for the data processing**.

```toml
## Configure a sink or source connector, depending on your needs in its own config file.
type = &quot;sink&quot;
key = &quot;quickwit&quot;
enabled = true
version = 0
name = &quot;Quickwit sink&quot;
path = &quot;target/release/libiggy_connector_quickwit_sink&quot;
plugin_config_format = &quot;yaml&quot;

[[streams]]
stream = &quot;qw&quot;
topics = [&quot;records&quot;]
schema = &quot;json&quot;
batch_length = 1000
poll_interval = &quot;5ms&quot;
consumer_group = &quot;qw_sink_connector&quot;

[transforms.add_fields]
enabled = true

[[transforms.add_fields.fields]]
key = &quot;service_name&quot;
value.static = &quot;qw_connector&quot;

[[transforms.add_fields.fields]]
key = &quot;timestamp&quot;
value.computed = &quot;timestamp_millis&quot;

[transforms.delete_fields]
enabled = true
fields = [&quot;email&quot;, &quot;created_at&quot;]
```

---

## Model Context Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. The **[Iggy MCP Server](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/ai/mcp)** is an implementation of the MCP protocol for the message streaming infrastructure. It can be used to provide context to LLMs in real-time, allowing for more accurate and relevant responses.

![server](assets/iggy_mcp_server.png)

---

## Docker

The official Apache Iggy images can be found in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iggy), simply type `docker pull apache/iggy` to pull the image.

You can also find the images for all the different tooling such as Connectors, MCP Server etc. at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/apache?page=1&amp;search=iggy).

Please note that the images tagged as `latest` are based on the official, stable releases, while the `edge` ones are updated directly from latest version of the `master` branch.

You can find the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` in the root of the repository. To build and start the server, run: `docker compose up`.

Additionally, you can run the `CLI` which is available in the running container, by executing: `docker exec -it iggy-server /iggy`.

Keep in mind that running the container on the OS other than Linux, where the Docker is running in the VM, might result in the performance degradation.

Also, when running the container, **make sure to include the additional capabilities**, as you can find in [docker-compose](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file:

```yml
cap_add:
  - SYS_NICE
security_opt:
  - seccomp:unconfined
ulimits:
  memlock:
    soft: -1
    hard: -1
```

---

## Configuration

The default configuration can be found in `server.toml` file in `configs` directory.

The configuration file is loaded from the current working directory, but you can specify the path to the configuration file by setting `IGGY_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, for example `export IGGY_CONFIG_PATH=configs/server.toml` (or other command depending on OS).

When config file is not found, the default values from embedded `server.toml` file are used.

For the detailed documentation of the configuration file, please refer to the [configuration](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/configuration) section.

---

## Quick start

Build the project (the longer compilation time is due to [LTO](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html) enabled in release [profile](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L2):

`cargo build`

Run the tests:

`cargo test`

Set root user credentials (OPTIONAL):

Iggy requires credentials to authenticate request to the server.
You can set the root user **before** starting the server.

(macOS/Linux)

```bash
export IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy
export IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy
```

(Windows(Powershell))

```bash
$env:IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME = &quot;iggy&quot;
$env:IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD = &quot;iggy&quot;
```

By default, `iggy-server` will generate a randomized root user password and print it to `stdout`, when there&#039;s
NO users created.

Start the server:

`cargo run --bin iggy-server`

All the data used by the server will be persisted under the `local_data` directory by default, unless specified differently in the configuration (see `system.path` in `server.toml`).

One can use default root credentials with optional `--with-default-root-credentials`.
This flag is equivalent to setting `IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy` and `IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy`, plus
it should only be used for development and testing.

`cargo run --bin iggy-server -- --with-default-root-credentials`

Root credentials are only set on the first server startup when the data directory doesn&#039;t exist yet. Once the server has been started and persisted data exists, the existing root credentials will be reused, and the `--with-default-root-credentials` flag or environment variables will have no effect. To reset credentials, delete the data directory.

For configuration options and detailed help:

`cargo run --bin iggy-server -- --help`

You can also use environment variables to override any configuration setting:

- Override TCP address
   `IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8090 cargo run --bin iggy-server`

- Set custom data path
   `IGGY_SYSTEM_PATH=/data/iggy cargo run --bin iggy-server`

- Enable HTTP transport
   `IGGY_HTTP_ENABLED=true cargo run --bin iggy-server`

- Set custom root user credentials
   `IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy cargo run --bin iggy-server`

To quickly generate the sample data:

`cargo run --bin data-seeder-tool`

*Please note that all commands below are using `iggy` binary, which is part of release (`cli` sub-crate).*

Create a stream with name `dev` (numerical ID will be assigned by server automatically) using default credentials and `tcp` transport (available transports: `quic`, `websocket`, `tcp`, `http`, default `tcp`):

`cargo run --bin iggy -- --transport tcp --username &lt;iggy_username&gt; --password &lt;iggy_password&gt; stream create dev`

List available streams:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- --username &lt;iggy_username&gt; --password &lt;iggy_password&gt; stream list`

Get `dev` stream details:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; stream get dev`

Create a topic named `sample` (numerical ID will be assigned by server automatically) for stream `dev`, with 2 partitions (IDs 1 and 2), disabled compression (`none`) and disabled message expiry (skipped optional parameter):

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; topic create dev sample 2 none`

List available topics for stream `dev`:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; topic list dev`

Get topic details for topic `sample` in stream `dev`:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; topic get dev sample`

Send a message &#039;hello world&#039; (message ID 1) to the stream `dev` to topic `sample` and partition 1:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; message send --partition-id 1 dev sample &quot;hello world&quot;`

Send another message &#039;lorem ipsum&#039; (message ID 2) to the same stream, topic and partition:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; message send --partition-id 1 dev sample &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;`

Poll messages by a regular consumer with ID 1 from the stream `dev` for topic `sample` and partition with ID 1, starting with offset 0, messages count 2, without auto commit (storing consumer offset on server):

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; message poll --consumer 1 --offset 0 --message-count 2 --auto-commit dev sample 1`

Finally, restart the server to see it is able to load the persisted data.

The HTTP API endpoints can be found in [server.http](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/core/server/server.http) file, which can be used with [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension for VS Code.

To see the detailed logs from the CLI/server, run it with `RUST_LOG=trace` environment variable. See images below:

## Examples

You can find comprehensive sample applications under the `examples/rust` directory. These examples showcase various usage patterns of the Iggy client SDK, from basic operations to advanced multi-tenant scenarios.

For detailed information about available examples and how to run them, please see the [Examples README](examples/rust/README.md).

---

## SDK

Iggy comes with the Rust SDK, which is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/iggy).

The SDK provides both, low-level client for the specific transport, which includes the message sending and polling along with all the administrative actions such as managing the streams, topics, users etc., as well as the high-level client, which abstracts the low-level details and provides the easy-to-use API for both, message producers and consumers.

You can find the more examples, including the multi-tenant one under the `examples` directory.

```rust
// Create the Iggy client
let client = IggyClient::from_connection_string(&quot;iggy://user:secret@localhost:8090&quot;)?;

// Create a producer for the given stream and one of its topics
let mut producer = client
    .producer(&quot;dev01&quot;, &quot;events&quot;)?
    .direct( // Use either direct (instant) or background message sending
        DirectConfig::builder()
            .batch_length(1000)
            .linger_time(IggyDuration::from_str(&quot;1ms&quot;)?)
            .build(),
    )
    .partitioning(Partitioning::balanced())
    .build();

producer.init().await?;

// Send some messages to the topic
let messages = vec![IggyMessage::from_str(&quot;Hello Apache Iggy&quot;)?];
producer.send(messages).await?;

// Create a consumer for the given stream and one of its topics
let mut consumer = client
    .consumer_group(&quot;my_app&quot;, &quot;dev01&quot;, &quot;events&quot;)?
    .auto_commit(AutoCommit::IntervalOrWhen(
        IggyDuration::from_str(&quot;1s&quot;)?,
        AutoCommitWhen::ConsumingAllMessages,
    ))
    .create_consumer_group_if_not_exists()
    .auto_join_consumer_group()
    .polling_strategy(PollingStrategy::next())
    .poll_interval(IggyDuration::from_str(&quot;1ms&quot;)?)
    .batch_length(1000)
    .build();

consumer.init().await?;

// Start consuming the messages
while let Some(message) = consumer.next().await {
    // Handle the message
}
```

## Benchmarks

**Benchmarks should be the first-class citizens**. We believe that performance is crucial for any system, and we strive to provide the best possible performance for our users. Please check, why we believe that the **[transparent
benchmarking](https://iggy.apache.org/blogs/2025/02/17/transparent-benchmarks)** is so important.

We&#039;ve also built the **[benchmarking platform](https://benchmarks.iggy.apache.org)** where anyone can upload the benchmarks and compare the results with others. Source code for the platform is available in the `core/bench/dashboard` directory.

![server](assets/benchmarking_platform.png)

For the benchmarking purposes, we&#039;ve developed the dedicated **iggy-bench** tool, which is a part of the **iggy** project. It is a command-line tool that allows you to run the variety of fully customizable benchmarks.

![server](assets/bench.png)

To benchmark the project, first build the project in release mode:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Then, run the benchmarking app with the desired options:

1. Sending (writing) benchmark

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v pinned-producer tcp
   ```

2. Polling (reading) benchmark

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v pinned-consumer tcp
   ```

3. Parallel sending and polling benchmark

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v pinned-producer-and-consumer tcp
   ```

4. Balanced sending to multiple partitions benchmark

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v balanced-producer tcp
   ```

5. Consumer group polling benchmark:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v balanced-consumer-group tcp
   ```

6. Parallel balanced sending and polling from consumer group benchmark:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v balanced-producer-and-consumer-group tcp
   ```

7. End to end producing and consuming benchmark (single task produces and consumes messages in sequence):

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v end-to-end-producing-consumer tcp
   ```

These benchmarks would start the server with the default configuration, create a stream, topic and partition, and then send or poll the messages. The default configuration is o

[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty).

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/23431#issuecomment-1302557034), lead developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) (also [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028)):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

### Installation

Ruff is available as [`ruff`](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) on PyPI.

Invoke Ruff directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```shell
uvx ruff check   # Lint all files in the current directory.
uvx ruff format  # Format all files in the current directory.
```

Or install Ruff with `uv` (recommended), `pip`, or `pipx`:

```shell
# With uv.
uv tool install ruff@latest  # Install Ruff globally.
uv add --dev ruff            # Or add Ruff to your project.

# With pip.
pip install ruff

# With pipx.

```

Starting with version `0.5.0`, Ruff can be installed with our standalone installers:

```shell
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ruff/install.sh | sh

# On Windows.
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/ruff/install.ps1 | iex&quot;

# For a specific version.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ruff/0.14.9/install.sh | sh
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/ruff/0.14.9/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

You can also install Ruff via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruff), [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ruff),
and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.14.9
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

---

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager. If you use npm:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Alternatively, if you use Homebrew:

```shell
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

If you&#039;re running into upgrade issues with Homebrew, see the [FAQ entry on brew upgrade codex](./docs/faq.md#brew-upgrade-codex-isnt-upgrading-me).

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](./docs/authentication.md#usage-based-billing-alternative-use-an-openai-api-key). If you previously used an API key for usage-based billing, see the [migration steps](./docs/authentication.md#migrating-from-usage-based-billing-api-key). If you&#039;re having trouble with login, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Codex can access MCP servers. To configure them, refer to the [config docs](./docs/config.md#mcp_servers).

### Configuration

Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For full configuration options, see [Configuration](./docs/config.md).

### Execpolicy

See the [Execpolicy quickstart](./docs/execpolicy.md) to set up rules that govern what commands Codex can execute.

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[wcc]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/working-copy/
[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [colocated local
workspace](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-compatibility#colocated-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results in a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily restore to
an earlier repo state, simply undo your operations one-by-one or even _revert_ a
particular operation which does not have to be the most recent one.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

## Usage

Winit is a window creation and management library. It can create windows and lets you handle
events (for example: the window being resized, a key being pressed, a mouse movement, etc.)
produced by the window.

Winit is designed to be a low-level brick in a hierarchy of libraries. Consequently, in order to
show something on the window you need to use the platform-specific getters provided by winit, or
another library.

## CONTRIBUTING

For contributing guidelines see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## MSRV Policy

This crate&#039;s Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is **1.85**. Changes to
the MSRV will be accompanied by a minor version bump.

As a **tentative** policy, the upper bound of the MSRV is given by the following
formula:

```
min(sid, stable - 3)
```

Where `sid` is the current version of `rustc` provided by [Debian Sid], and
`stable` is the latest stable version of Rust. This bound may be broken in case of a major ecosystem shift or a security vulnerability.

[Debian Sid]: https://packages.debian.org/sid/rustc

An exception is made for the Android platform, where a higher Rust version
must be used for certain Android features. In this case, the MSRV will be
capped at the latest stable version of Rust minus three. This inconsistency is
not reflected in Cargo metadata, as it is not powerful enough to expose this
restriction.

Redox OS is also not covered by this MSRV policy, as it requires a Rust nightly
toolchain to compile.

All crates in the [`rust-windowing`] organizations have the
same MSRV policy.

---

**Burn is a next generation Tensor Library and Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on
&lt;br /&gt; flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Burn is both a tensor library and a deep learning framework optimized for numerical computing, model
inference and model training. Burn leverages Rust to perform optimizations normally only available
in static-graph frameworks, offering optimal speed without impacting flexibility.

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust
implementations. We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your
models in the cloud, then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.

&lt;/div&gt;

### Supported Backends

Most backends support all operating systems, so we don&#039;t mention them in the tables below.

**GPU Backends:**

|         | CUDA | ROCm | Metal | Vulkan | WebGPU | Candle | LibTorch |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Nvidia  | ☑️   | -    | -     | ☑️     | ☑️     | ☑️     | ☑️       |
| AMD     | -    | ☑️   | -     | ☑️     | ☑️     | -      | ☑️       |
| Apple   | -    | -    | ☑️    | -      | ☑️     | -      | ☑️       |
| Intel   | -    | -    | -     | ☑️     | ☑️     | -      | -        |
| Qualcom | -    | -    | -     | ☑️     | ☑️     | -      | -        |
| Wasm    | -    | -    | -     | -      | ☑️     | -      | -        |

**CPU Backends:**

|        | Cpu (CubeCL) | NdArray | Candle | LibTorch |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| X86    | ☑️           | ☑️      | ☑️     | ☑️       |
| Arm    | ☑️           | ☑️      | ☑️     | ☑️       |
| Wasm   | -            | ☑️      | ☑️     | -        |
| no-std | -            | ☑️      | -      | -        |

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend 🔄
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let device = Default::default();

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default, &amp;device).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
All first-party accelerated backends (like WGPU and CUDA) use Fusion by default (`burn/fusion`
feature flag), so you typically don&#039;t need to apply it manually.

```rust
#[cfg(not(feature = &quot;fusion&quot;))]
pub type Cuda&lt;F = f32, I = i32&gt; = CubeBackend&lt;CudaRuntime, F, I, u8&gt;;

#[cfg(feature = &quot;fusion&quot;)]
pub type Cuda&lt;F = f32, I = i32&gt; = burn_fusion::Fusion&lt;CubeBackend&lt;CudaRuntime, F, I, u8&gt;&gt;;
```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on
the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server. The client sends tensor operations over the
network to a remote compute backend. You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line
of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand 👇**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard 📈
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption 🛡

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support 🐫
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn supports importing ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models, allowing you to easily port
models from TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn. The ONNX model is converted into Rust code that uses
Burn&#039;s native APIs, enabling the imported model to run on any Burn backend (CPU, GPU, WebAssembly)
and benefit from all of Burn&#039;s optimizations like automatic kernel fusion.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch or Safetensors Models 🚚
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You can load weights from PyTorch or Safetensors formats directly into your Burn-defined models.
This makes it easy to reuse existing models while benefiting from Burn&#039;s performance and deployment
features.

Learn more:

- [Import pre-trained PyTorch models into Burn](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/pytorch-model.html)
- [Load models from Safetensors format](https://burn.dev/books/burn/import/safetensors-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser 🌐
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can run in WebAssembly environments: Candle and NdArray for CPU execution,
and WGPU for GPU acceleration via WebGPU. This means that you can run inference directly within a
browser. We provide several examples of this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2️⃣ 7️⃣ 😰
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! 🌄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ⚙️
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).

&gt; ⚠️ **Warning** When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related
&gt; to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency
&gt; chain. To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs`
&gt; file:
&gt;
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due
&gt; to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.

## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-walking.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/books/burn/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests 😄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples 🙏
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

We have a somewhat large amount of [examples](./examples) in the repository that shows how to use
the framework in different scenarios.

Following [the book](https://burn.dev/books/burn/):

- [Basic Workflow](./examples/guide) : Creates a custom CNN `Module` to train on the MNIST dataset
  and use for inference.
- [Custom Training Loop](./examples/custom-training-loop) : Implements a basic training loop instead
  of using the `Learner`.
- [Custom WGPU Kernel](./examples/custom-wgpu-kernel) : Learn how to create your own custom
  operation with the WGPU backend.

Additional examples:

- [Custom CSV Dataset](./examples/custom-csv-dataset) : Implements a dataset to parse CSV data for a
  regression task.
- [Regression](./examples/simple-regression) : Trains a simple MLP on the California Housing dataset
  to predict the median house value for a district.

Pre-trained Models 🤖
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

We keep an updated and curated list of models and examples built with Burn, see the
[tracel-ai/models repository](https://github.com/tracel-ai/models) for more details.

Don&#039;t see the model you want? Don&#039;t hesitate to open an issue, and we may prioritize it. Built a
model using Burn and want to share it? You can also open a Pull Request and add your model under the

&lt;summary&gt;
Why use Rust for Deep Learning? 🦀
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Deep Learning is a special form of software where you need very high level abstractions as well as
extremely fast execution time. Rust is the perfect candidate for that use case since it provides
zero-cost abstractions to easily create neural network modules, and fine-grained control over memory
to optimize every detail.

It&#039;s important that a framework be easy to use at a high level so that its users can focus on
innovating in the AI field. However, since running models relies so heavily on computations,
performance can&#039;t be neglected.

To this day, the mainstream solution to this problem has been to offer APIs in Python, but rely on
bindings to low-level languages such as C/C++. This reduces portability, increases complexity and
creates frictions between researchers and engineers. We feel like Rust&#039;s approach to abstractions
makes it versatile enough to tackle this two languages dichotomy.

Rust also comes with the Cargo package manager, which makes it incredibly easy to build, test, and
deploy from any environment, which is usually a pain in Python.

Although Rust has the reputation of being a difficult language at first, we strongly believe it
leads to more reliable, bug-free solutions built faster (after some practice 😅)!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&gt; **Deprecation Note**&lt;br /&gt;Since `0.14.0`, the internal structure for tensor data has changed. The
&gt; previous `Data` struct was deprecated and officially removed since `0.17.0` in favor of the new
&gt; `TensorData` struct, which allows for more flexibility by storing the underlying data as bytes and
&gt; keeping the data type as a field. If you are using `Data` in your code, make sure to switch to
&gt; `TensorData`.

&lt;!-- &gt;
&gt; In the event that you are trying to load a model record saved in a previous version, make sure to
&gt; enable the `record-backward-compat` feature using a previous version of burn (&lt;=0.16.0). Otherwise,
&gt; the record won&#039;t be deserialized correctly and you will get an error message (which will also point
&gt; you to the backward compatible feature flag). The backward compatibility was maintained for
&gt; deserialization (loading), so as soon as you have saved the record again it will be saved according
&gt; to the new structure and you will be able to upgrade to this version. Please note that binary formats
&gt; are not backward compatible. Thus, you will need to load your record in a previous version and save it
&gt; to another of the self-describing record formats before using a compatible version (as described) with the
&gt; `record-backward-compat` feature flag. --&gt;

&lt;details id=&quot;deprecation&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Loading Model Records From Previous Versions ⚠️
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In the event that you are trying to load a model record saved in a version older than `0.14.0`, make
sure to use a compatible version (`0.14`, `0.15` or `0.16`) with the `record-backward-compat`
feature flag.

```
features = [..., &quot;record-backward-compat&quot;]
```

Otherwise, the record won&#039;t be deserialized correctly and you will get an error message. This e

## ⚓ Oxc

_/oʊ ɛks siː/_

The Oxidation Compiler is a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript written in Rust.

Oxc is part of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/)&#039;s vision for a unified, high-performance toolchain for JavaScript. It powers [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) ([Vite]&#039;s future bundler) and enables the next generation of ultra-fast development tools that work seamlessly together.

For more information, check out our website at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs).

&lt;sub&gt;\* Oxidation is the chemical process that creates rust&lt;/sub&gt;

## 🏗️ Design Principles

- **Performance**: Through rigorous performance engineering.
- **Correctness**: Through conformance testing to standards and similar projects.
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and sensible configuration.
- **Modular composability**: Use individual components independently or compose them into complete toolchains.

------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

packaging as Debian:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

(N.B. Various snaps for ripgrep on Ubuntu are also available, but none of them
seem to work right and generate a number of very strange bug reports that I
don&#039;t know how to fix and don&#039;t have the time to fix. Therefore, it is no
longer a recommended installation option.)

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.85.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.85.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

IronCalc is a new, modern, work-in-progress spreadsheet engine and set of tools to work with spreadsheets in diverse settings.

This repository contains the main engine and the xlsx reader and writer.

Programmed in Rust, you will be able to use it from a variety of programming languages like Python, JavaScript (wasm), nodejs and possibly R, Julia or Go.

We will build different _skins_: in the terminal, as a desktop application or use it in your own web application.

# Docker

If you have docker installed just run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

head over to &lt;http://localhost:2080&gt; to test the application.

# Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

# Testing, linting and code coverage

Test are run automatically and test coverage can always be found in [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ironcalc/IronCalc)

If you want to run the tests yourself:

```bash
make tests
```

Note that this runs unit tests, integration tests, linter tests and formatting tests.

If you want to run the code coverage yourself:
```bash
make coverage
cd target/coverage/html/
python -m http.server
```

# API Documentation

Documentation is published at: https://docs.rs/ironcalc/latest/ironcalc/

It might be generated locally

```bash
$ make docs
$ cd target/doc
$ python -m http.server
```

And visit &lt;http://0.0.0.0:8000/ironcalc/&gt;

# Simple example

Add the dependency to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
ironcalc = { git = &quot;https://github.com/ironcalc/IronCalc&quot;, version = &quot;0.5&quot;}
```

And then use this code in `main.rs`:

```rust
use ironcalc::{
    base::{expressions::utils::number_to_column, Model},
    export::save_to_xlsx,
};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let mut model = Model::new_empty(&quot;hello-calc.xlsx&quot;, &quot;en&quot;, &quot;UTC&quot;)?;
    // Adds a square of numbers in the first sheet
    for row in 1..100 {
        for column in 1..100 {
            let value = row * column;
            model.set_user_input(0, row, column, format!(&quot;{}&quot;, value));
        }
    }
    // Adds a new sheet
    model.add_sheet(&quot;Calculation&quot;)?;
    // column 100 is CV
    let last_column = number_to_column(100).unwrap();
    let formula = format!(&quot;=SUM(Sheet1!A1:{}100)&quot;, last_column);
    model.set_user_input(1, 1, 1, formula);

    // evaluates
    model.evaluate();

    // saves to disk
    save_to_xlsx(&amp;model, &quot;hello-calc.xlsx&quot;)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

See more examples in the `examples` folder of the xlsx crate.

# Collaborators needed!. Call to action

We don&#039;t have a vibrant community just yet. This is the very stages of the project. But if you are passionate about code with high standards and no compromises, if you are looking for a project with high impact, if you are interested in a better, more open infrastructure for spreadsheets, whether you are a developer (rust, python, TypeScript, electron/tauri/anything else native app, React, you name it), a designer, an Excel power user who wants features, a business looking to integrate a MIT/Apache licensed spreadsheet in your own SaaS application join us!

The best place to start will be to join or [discord channel](https://discord.gg/zZYWfh3RHJ) or send us an email at hello@ironcalc.com.

Many have said it better before me:

&gt; Folks wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.

### Step 2. Set up your shell to use Starship

Configure your shell to initialize starship. Select yours from the list below:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Bash&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
eval &quot;$(starship init bash)&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cmd&lt;/summary&gt;

You need to use [Clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html) (v1.2.30+) with Cmd.
Create a file at this path `%LocalAppData%\clink\starship.lua` with the following contents:

```lua
load(io.popen(&#039;starship init cmd&#039;):read(&quot;*a&quot;))()
```

&lt;/details&gt;

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [pmem device](docs/pmem.md) to the microVM.
- Configure and manage [memory hotplugging](docs/memory-hotplug.md).
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

Usage
----------

To include liquid in your project add the following to your Cargo.toml:

```console
$ cargo add liquid
```

Example:

```rust
let template = liquid::ParserBuilder::with_stdlib()
    .build().unwrap()
    .parse(&quot;Liquid! {{num | minus: 2}}&quot;).unwrap();

let globals = liquid::object!({
    &quot;num&quot;: 4f64
});

let output = template.render(&amp;globals).unwrap();
assert_eq!(output, &quot;Liquid! 2&quot;.to_string());
```

You can find a reference on Liquid syntax [here](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers).

Customizing Liquid
------------------

### Language Variants

By default, `liquid-rust` has no filters, tags, or blocks.  You can enable the
default set or pick and choose which to add to suit your application.

### Create your own filters

Creating your own filters is very easy. Filters are simply functions or
closures that take an input `Value` and a `Vec&lt;Value&gt;` of optional arguments
and return a `Value` to be rendered or consumed by chained filters.

See
[filters/](https://github.com/cobalt-org/liquid-rust/blob/master/crates/lib/src/stdlib/filters)
for what a filter implementation looks like.  You can then register it by
calling `liquid::ParserBuilder::filter`.

### Create your own tags

Tags are made up of two parts, the initialization and the rendering.

Initialization happens when the parser hits a Liquid tag that has your
designated name. You will have to specify a function or closure that will
then return a `Renderable` object to do the rendering.

See
[include_tag.rs](https://github.com/cobalt-org/liquid-rust/blob/master/crates/lib/src/stdlib/tags/include_tag.rs)
for what a tag implementation looks like.  You can then register it by calling `liquid::ParserBuilder::tag`.

### Create your own tag blocks

Blocks work very similar to Tags. The only difference is that blocks contain other
markup, which is why block initialization functions take another argument, a list
of `Element`s that are inside the specified block.

See
[comment_block.rs](https://github.com/cobalt-org/liquid-rust/blob/master/crates/lib/src/stdlib/blocks/comment_block.rs)
for what a block implementation looks like.  You can then register it by
calling `liquid::ParserBuilder::block`.

Are you also using Rig in production? [Open an issue](https://www.github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig/issues) to have your name added!

## Get Started
```bash
cargo add rig-core
```

### Simple example
```rust
use rig::{client::CompletionClient, completion::Prompt, providers::openai};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create OpenAI client and model
    // This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

    let gpt4 = openai_client.agent(&quot;gpt-4&quot;).build();

    // Prompt the model and print its response
    let response = gpt4
        .prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;)
        .await
        .expect(&quot;Failed to prompt GPT-4&quot;);

    println!(&quot;GPT-4: {response}&quot;);
}
```
Note using `#[tokio::main]` requires you enable tokio&#039;s `macros` and `rt-multi-thread` features
or just `full` to enable all features (`cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread`).

You can find more examples each crate&#039;s `examples` (ie. [`rig-core/examples`](./rig-core/examples)) directory. More detailed use cases walkthroughs are regularly published on our [Dev.to Blog](https://dev.to/0thtachi) and added to Rig&#039;s official documentation [(docs.rig.rs)](http://docs.rig.rs).

&lt;/p&gt;

## Troubleshooting

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;See details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that may arise are likely due to your system missing dependencies
required to correctly analyze a network adapter. &lt;br&gt;
Check the [required dependencies page](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Required-dependencies) 
for instructions on how to proceed depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not updated,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may manifest bugs (the interface glitches, color gradients are unsupported, or some icons are completely black). &lt;br&gt;
In these cases you can set an environment variable to switch to the `tiny-skia` renderer,
a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment:

```sh
ICED_BACKEND=tiny-skia
```

### ***In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/new/choose), and I will do my best to help you!***
